In analogy to the current situation in Cosmology, glycans can be considered as the “dark matter” of the biological universe: a major and critical component that has yet to be fully incorporated into the “standard model” of biology. However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities.'
 'With ongoing sequencing of numerous genomes, spectacular gains in understanding the biology of nucleic acids and proteins have occurred. Thus, many scientists assume that studying just these molecules will explain the makeup of cells, tissues, organs, physiological systems, and intact organisms. In fact, making a cell requires many small molecule metabolites as well as two other major classes of macromolecules—lipids and carbohydrates—which serve as intermediates in generating energy and as signaling effectors, recognition markers, and structural components. Taken together with the fact that they encompass some of the major posttranslational modifications of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates help explain how the relatively small number of genes in the typical genome can generate the enormous biological complexities inherent in the development, growth, and functioning of diverse organisms. The biological roles of carbohydrates are particularly prominent in the assembly of complex multicellular organs and organisms, which requires interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix.'
 'The major glycan classes discussed in the book are described, and an overview of the general pathways for their biosynthesis is provided. Topological issues relevant to biosynthesis and functions of glycoconjugates are also considered, and the growing role of these molecules in medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioenergy, and materials science is mentioned. Defined in the broadest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (also called carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature and of the proteins that recognize them. How does glycobiology fit into the modern concepts of molecular biology? The central paradigm driving research in molecular biology has been that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The power of this concept lies in its template-based precision, the ability to manipulate one class of molecules based on knowledge of another, and the patterns of sequence homology and relatedness that predict function and reveal evolutionary relationships.'
 'Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states. Significant progress has also been made in Systems Glycobiology by better integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Our understanding as to how miRNAs and transcription factors regulate glycan expression has also improved in the last few years (Chapters 51 and 52). At the present time, the study of glycan structure/function relationships requires highly specialized expertise in synthetic and analytical chemistry. The inherent difficulty in studying glycans remains a major challenge preventing glycobiology—the study of glycan function—from entering mainstream conceptual frameworks of biology. In response to this challenge, strong emphasis has recently been placed on the development of facile technologies that will allow nonglycobiologists without specialized analytical chemistry skills to study glycans in a meaningful way.'
 'Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities. Furthermore, during the molecular biology revolution of the 1970s, studies of glycans lagged far behind those of other major classes of molecules. This was in part because of their inherent structural complexity, the difficulty in determining their sequences, and the fact that their biosynthesis could not be directly predicted from a DNA template. The development of many new technologies for exploring the structures and functions of glycans has since opened a new frontier of molecular biology called “glycobiology”—a word first coined in the late 1980s to recognize the coming together of the traditional disciplines of carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry with a modern understanding of the cell and molecular biology of glycans and, in particular, their conjugates with proteins and lipids. Glycobiology is now one of the more rapidly growing fields in the natural sciences, with broad relevance to many areas of basic research, biomedicine, and biotechnology.'
 'Given all these major advances in basic and applied research on glycans, there is no reason why this major class of biomolecules should continue to be the “dark matter of the biological universe.” However, since the 1980s an entire generation of scientists have been largely trained without much exposure to, or knowledge of, glycans. Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease.'
 '), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates. The advancement of glycoscience as a discipline depends on expanding the integration of data describing glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, lipopolysaccharides, and the genome-coded enzymatic machinery that generates or breaks down these glycans, together with the ever-increasing information about the interactions of these glycoconjugates with other components of the cell. It is the ultimate goal of glycoscience research to be able to link glycan structures with their function.']","The study of glycobiology, which encompasses the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides, plays a crucial role in understanding the complexity of biological systems. Glycans, including glycoproteins and glycolipids, serve as regulatory switches within cells and are essential for various biological activities. Despite their importance, glycans have historically been overlooked in molecular biology, similar to how dark matter is a significant yet not fully understood component of the universe. As advancements continue in glycoscience research and the training of scientists in this field, glycans are gradually gaining recognition and integration into mainstream biological frameworks.","However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans.

We use a symbolic notation for the monosaccharides that are most abundant in vertebrate glycoconjugates (see Chapter 1). Common monosaccharides found in vertebrates. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common form of sialic acid.  Monosaccharides exist in solution as an equilibrium mixture of acyclic and cyclic forms. The percentage of each form depends on the sugar structure.'
 'Of course, the great majority of glycans in most species have yet to be discovered and structurally defined. Thus, much of the possible diversity may yet exist in nature. Although several hundred distinct monosaccharides are known in nature, only a minority of these are commonly found in well-studied glycans. Examples of common monosaccharides in vertebrate cells are listed below, along with their standard abbreviations (for details regarding their structures, see Chapter 2, and embedded links from the symbols in Online Appendix 1B). Pentoses: five-carbon neutral sugars—D-xylose (Xyl)Hexoses: six-carbon neutral sugars—for example, D-glucose (Glc)Hexosamines: hexoses with an amino group at the 2-position, which can be either free or, more commonly, N-acetylated—for example, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)6-Deoxyhexoses: for example,'
 'Most vertebrate monosaccharides have the D configuration with the exception of fucose and iduronic acid (IdoA) L sugars.

Fischer projections for the acyclic forms of the D series of aldoses, ranging from triose to hexose.  Any two sugars that differ only in the configuration around a single chiral carbon atom are called epimers. For example, D-mannose is the C-2 epimer of D-glucose, whereas D-galactose is the C-4 epimer of D-glucose (Figure 2.4). Monosaccharide names are frequently abbreviated; most common are three-letter abbreviations for simple monosaccharides (e.g., Gal, Glc, Man, Xyl, Fuc).'
 'the symbols D- and L- are omitted from the full names of common monosaccharides from here on unless a less common variant occurs. This limited set of monosaccharides dominates the glycobiology of more recently evolved (so-called “higher”) animals, but several others have been found in “lower” animals (e.g., tyvelose [Chapters 25 and 26], bacteria and Archaea [e.g., keto-deoxyoctulosonic acid, rhamnose, L-arabinose, and muramic acid; Chapters 21 and 22], and plants [e.g., arabinose, apiose, and galacturonic acid; Chapter 24]). A variety of modifications of glycans further enhance their diversity in nature and often serve to mediate specific biological functions. Thus, the hydroxyl groups of different monosaccharides can be subject to modifications such as phosphorylation, sulfation, methylation, O-acetylation, or fatty acylation.'
 'more commonly, N-acetylated—for example, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)6-Deoxyhexoses: for example, L-fucose (Fuc)Uronic acids: hexoses with a carboxylate at the 6-position—for example, D-glucuronic acid (GlcA)Nonulosonic acids: family of nine-carbon acidic sugars, of which the most common in animals is the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, also sometimes called NeuAc or, historically, NANA) (see Chapter 15) For simplicity, the symbols D- and L- are omitted from the full names of common monosaccharides from here on unless a less common variant occurs.'
 'A monosaccharide is a carbohydrate that usually cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler form. It has a potential carbonyl group at the end of the carbon chain (an aldehyde group) or at an inner carbon (a ketone group). These two types of monosaccharides are therefore named aldoses and ketoses, respectively (for examples, see below, and for more details, see Chapter 2). Free monosaccharides can exist in open-chain or ring forms (Figure 1.2). Ring forms of the monosaccharides are the general rule in oligosaccharides, which are linear or branched chains of monosaccharides attached to one another via glycosidic linkages (the term “polysaccharide” is typically used for large glycans composed of repeating oligosaccharide motifs; for examples, see Chapter 3).'
 'The classification of monosaccharide structures began in the late 19th century with the pioneering work of Emil Fischer. All simple monosaccharides have the general empirical formula Cx(H2O)n, where n is an integer ranging from 3 to 9. As mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, all monosaccharides consist of a chain of chiral hydroxymethylene units, which terminates at one end with a hydroxymethyl group and at the other with either an aldehyde group (aldoses) or an α-hydroxy ketone group (ketoses). Glyceraldehyde is the simplest aldose and dihydroxyacetone is the simplest ketose (Figure 2.1). The structures of glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone are distinct in that glyceraldehyde contains an asymmetric (chiral) carbon atom (Figure 2.1), whereas dihydroxyacetone does not.']",N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common form of sialic acid. Monosaccharides exist in solution as an equilibrium mixture of acyclic and cyclic forms.

N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common form of sialic acid.  Monosaccharides exist in solution as an equilibrium mixture of acyclic and cyclic forms. The percentage of each form depends on the sugar structure. The cyclic form of a monosaccharide is characterized by a hemiacetal group formed by the reaction of one of the hydroxyl groups with the C-1 aldehyde or ketone. For reasons of chemical stability, five- and six-membered rings are most commonly formed from acyclic monosaccharides. Hexoses (six-carbon aldoses) and hexuloses (six-carbon ketoses) form six-membered rings via a C-1—O—C-5 ring closure; they form five-membered rings through a C-1—O—C-4 ring closure (Figure 2.5). A five-membered cyclic hemiacetal is labeled a “furanose” and a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called a “pyranose.” Pentoses can form both pyranose and furanose forms. Cyclization of acyclic D-glucose to form pyranose and furanose structures. The cyclization reaction produces both the α and β anomers (i.e., C-1 epimers).",0.5,0.4835658633236606,0.754552276678264,0.027777777777777776,0.759523809508619,0.4166666666666667
"Complete the following paragraph: In solution, NMR studies show IdoA2S and IdoA residues to be present in a mixture of 1C4 and 2S0 conformations. The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins.","['Until now, only the 4C1 chair conformation has been verified experimentally for GlcA and GlcN in HS, but both the 1C4 chair and the 2S0 conformations have been found for IdoA2S residues in crystal structures containing HS. In solution, NMR studies show IdoA2S and IdoA residues to be present in a mixture of 1C4 and 2S0 conformations. The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins. Structural elements that dictate preferences for one form over the other, including the possible effects from the sulfated monosaccharide sequences around the IdoA/IdoA2S residue, are subject to further investigation. A second factor contributing to structural diversity and selective interactions with certain HS-binding proteins is the size of the sulfated saccharide domains.'
 'In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding. IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind. Thus, the greater degree of conformational flexibility in these modified regions may explain why so many more proteins bind with high affinity to heparin, HS, and DS than to other GAGs. The presence of an N-acetyl group in an N-acetylglucosamine residue changes the preferred conformation of the neighboring IdoA residue, showing that even minor modifications can influence conformation and chain flexibility. Binding to GAGs that have a low degree of sulfation may require larger domains in the protein to interact with longer stretches of an oligosaccharide.'
 'Inspection of heparin oligosaccharides containing highly modified domains ([GlcNS6S-IdoA2S]n) shows that the N-sulfo and 2-O-sulfo groups of each disaccharide repeat lie on opposite sides of the helix from the 6-O-sulfo and carboxyl groups (Figure 38.1). Analysis of the conformation of individual sugars shows that N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid residues assume a preferred conformation in solution, designated 4C1 (indicating that carbon 4 is above the plane defined by carbons 2, 3, and 5 and the ring oxygen, and that carbon 1 is below the plane; Chapter 2). In contrast, IdoA2S assumes the 1C4 or the 2S0 conformation (Figure 38.1), which reorients the position of the sulfo substituents, thereby creating a different orientation of charged groups.'
 'Also, heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS, is a commonly used anticoagulant drug in the clinic. A more complete discussion of the biological function of HS can be found in Chapters 17 and Chapter 38. This section uses the interaction between HS and proteins to illustrate how structural factors affect binding between GAGs and proteins in general. One factor that contributes to the structural diversity of HS-protein interactions is the conformational flexibility of L-IdoA and its derivative, L-IdoA2S (2-O-sulfo iduronic acid). Present in the pyranose form, the six-membered ring structure of IdoA or IdoA2S can adopt either chair or skew-boat conformations (Figure 3.3B).'
 'A second factor contributing to structural diversity and selective interactions with certain HS-binding proteins is the size of the sulfated saccharide domains. HS isolated from natural sources shows domain-like structures, with clusters of six to eight saccharides forming the highly sulfated domains known as S-domains. These regions are separated by nonsulfated saccharide residues, consisting of GlcA-GlcNAc RUs, known as NAc-domains. The S-domains contain primarily IdoA residues that likely contribute the flexibility needed to optimize binding to proteins and elicit desired biological activities. The contribution of NAc-domains to the functions of HS has not been fully established. However, a possible role may be to appropriately position S-domains in a single polysaccharide chain for interaction with multiple proteins. One example is the interaction of heparin with antithrombin and thrombin.'
 'Despite the interest in the roles of these interactions in cell migration and differentiation, there are relatively few experimental structures depicting interactions with large HS fragments. The fact that suitable crystals are less apt to form in the presence of HS oligomers contributes to the lack of structures of complexes. Also, it is difficult to obtain homogeneous preparations of large oligomers, because of the variable sulfation patterns and variable conversion of GlcA to IdoA. Computational modeling offers an alternative route to structures for many of these complexes. Specific patterns of sulfation and IdoA substitution are generated with ease. Yet, there are some challenges related to the flexibility of the HS chains and the ionic character of interactions that dominate their energetics; glycosidic angles in HS chains are variable, and IdoA rings sample several conformations, including a chair, 1C4, and a skew-boat conformer, 2S0.'
 'Binding to GAGs that have a low degree of sulfation may require larger domains in the protein to interact with longer stretches of an oligosaccharide. Molecular dynamic simulations on large heparin oligosaccharides, even in the presence of proteins, are possible with recent advances in computer performance (Online Appendix 38A). Such simulations can be used to predict the conformational flexibility of different domains within the chain and, when combined with recent advances in protein–GAG docking, can provide additional insights into GAG–protein interactions. Conformation of heparin oligosaccharides.

 'Thus, evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu. Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below).'
 'The most abundant biopolymers in nature include secreted polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin, and glycosaminoglycans. These large, chemically stable molecules provide crucial structural support for capsules, cell walls, exoskeletons, and extracellular matrices of countless organisms. The repeated β1-4 glycosidic linkages of cellulose and chitin also represent chemically extremely resistant sequestrations of accumulated glycans, given the inability of most organisms to hydrolyze these robust linkages. Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution. Viruses typically have minimalist genomes and use host-cell machinery for replication.'
 'At the same time, each of these microorganisms is itself host to its own suite of parasites (phages), known to exploit the cell surface glycans of microbes in order to infect these. Host populations (multicellular organisms infected by microbes or microbes infected by phages) may evolve new modifications of the structures targeted by their parasites, especially if the latter had meanwhile evolved a vital function elsewhere within the organism. This would constrain the preservation of the underlying scaffolding on which the latest modification was placed, while adding yet another layer of complexity to host glycans. Such cycles of evolutionary interaction between (nested sets of) microbes and hosts might explain some of the complex and extended sugar chains found in multicellular organisms, especially in areas of frequent microbial contact, such as in secreted mucins on mucosal surfaces. In this manner, “junk” glycans (i.e., glycans without current adaptive value) could accumulate, akin to “junk” DNA.'
 'The challenge then is to predict and sort out which distinct roles can be assigned to a given glycan structure in a given cell type and organism. In the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and hosts, pathogens will tend to exploit glycans that are difficult for the host to change (those constrained by their intrinsic host function), and because hosts are unable to alter their glycans easily owing to their slower evolutionary rates and functional constraints of existing glycans, the extrinsic and intrinsic functions of these glycans are bound to overlap. Hosts can, however, to the degree possible, be expected to evolve glycans that are difficult for microbes to mimic, such as the vertebrate-specific sialic acid Neu5Gc (Chapter 15) and sulfated GAGs, prokaryotes do not seem to have reinvented (Chapter 17). Because microorganisms and parasites that bind glycans evolve in parallel with their multicellular hosts, they must adapt their glycan-binding “repertoire” to any change in glycan structure presented by the host.'
 'Arthropods evolved resistant chitin-rich exoskeletons. Cellulose and chitin represent the two most abundant biopolymers on the planet. In multicellular organisms, glycan constituents of matrix molecules, such as proteoglycans, are important for maintenance of tissue structure, porosity, and integrity. Such molecules can also contain binding sites for other specific glycans, which, in turn, aid overall matrix organization. The external location of glycans on most glycoproteins can provide a general shield, protecting the underlying polypeptide from recognition by proteases (mucins), blocking antibody binding (viral glycoproteins), and even (as in the case of mucins) protecting entire tissue surfaces from microbial attachment. Another structural role of glycans is their involvement in folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or in the subsequent maintenance of protein solubility and conformation (Chapter 39).'
 'These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow. Glycosylation in Bacteria and Archaea is far more diverse, both in terms of the range of monosaccharides used or synthesized, and in the types of linkages and modifications (Chapters 21 and 22). In addition, prokaryotic cell–cell interactions both within and between species are often mediated by glycans. However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity.']","Evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu.

Most organisms can synthesize the other monosaccharides needed for glycan biosynthesis from these sources. Not all of these biosynthetic pathways are equally active in all types of cells. However, there are some general principles.'
 'The nucleotide sugar donors are synthesized within the cytosolic or nuclear compartment from monosaccharide precursors of endogenous or exogenous origin and then actively transported across a membrane bilayer into the lumen of the ER and Golgi compartments (Chapter 5). Notably, the portion of the glycoconjugate that faces the inside of these compartments will ultimately face the outside of the cell or the inside of a secretory granule or lysosome and will be topologically unexposed to the cytosol. The biosynthetic enzymes (glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, etc.) responsible for catalyzing these reactions are well studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. A classical model envisioned that these enzymes are physically lined up along this pathway in the precise sequence in which they actually work.'
 'Almost all donors for glycosylation reactions and glycan modifications are synthesized within the cytosolic compartment, from precursors of endogenous origin. In eukaryotes, most of these donors are actively transported across a membrane bilayer by specific multipass transporter proteins, becoming available for reactions within the lumen of the ER–Golgi pathway. For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments. Indeed, one of them (O-linked GlcNAc; Chapter 19) may well be quantitatively the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cells.'
 'Iduronic acid does not have a nucleotide sugar parent because it is formed by epimerization of glucuronic acid after it is incorporated into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In some instances, one nucleotide sugar can be formed from another either by direct epimerization (reaction 2 above) or by a nucleotide exchange reaction (reaction 3 above). For example, UDP-Gal is made from UDP-Glc by exchange of Gal-1-P for Glc-1-P. Activated sugar donors in animal cells  Three types of sugar transporters carry sugars across the plasma membrane into cells. First are energy-independent facilitated diffusion transporters, such as the glucose transporter (GLUT) family of hexose transporters found in yeast and most mammalian cells. The genes encoding these proteins are named SLC2A (solute carriers 2A).'
 'This is usually sufficient to reach or exceed the calculated Km of glycosyltransferases that use these donors. Some known transporters for nucleotide sugars, PAPS (3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate), and ATP are located in the Golgi membranes of mammals, yeast, protozoa, and plants. These proteins are antiporters and return the corresponding (more...) Most of these antiporters are found in the Golgi, but some are also found in the ER. They are organelle-specific and their location usually corresponds to the location of the relevant glycosyltransferases (Table 5.2; Figure 5.4). Nucleotide sugar import into the Golgi is not energy-dependent nor affected by ionophores. However, the import is competitively inhibited by the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and diphosphates in the cytosol but not by the monosaccharides.'
 'Thus, extracellular soluble forms of many glycosyltransferases exist in tissues and sera and may function as transferases if nucleotide sugars are present extracellularly. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm, except for CMP-sialic acids, which are synthesized in the nucleus (Chapter 5). They are subsequently concentrated in the appropriate compartment following transport across the membrane by specialized nucleotide sugar transporters that translocate CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Fuc, and other nucleotide sugars. A few of these transporters can transport more than one nucleotide sugar. Each transporter is a multitransmembrane protein that usually contains 10 membrane-spanning domains. Some CMP-sialic acids can be further modified within the lumen of the Golgi by O-acetyl groups before transfer to a glycan acceptor (Chapter 15).'
 'Interestingly, many of these proteins have glycan binding properties, which would presumably cause problems if they instead traversed the glycan rich ER–Golgi pathway. Regardless of location, most glycosylation reactions use activated forms of monosaccharides (often nucleotide sugars and in some cases lipid-phosphate-linked sugars, such as dolichol phosphate mannose) as donors for glycosyltransferases (see Chapter 5 for a listing of some enzymes, their donors and corresponding transporters, and details about their biochemistry). A variety of glycan modifications also occur in nature (Chapter 6). Of these, the most common are generated by sulfotransferases, acetyltransferases, and methyltransferases, which use activated forms of sulfate (3′-phosphoadenyl-5′-phosphosulfate; PAPS), acetate (acetyl-CoA), and methyl groups (S-adenosylmethionine; AdoMet), respectively.']","Cells in eukaryotic organisms primarily carry out glycosylation processes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Meanwhile, the activation and interconversion of monosaccharides predominantly take place in the cytoplasm. Specific transporters for nucleotide sugars facilitate the transfer of activated sugar donors into the Golgi, with some transport also occurring in the ER. Additionally, in certain instances, nucleotide sugars are utilized to produce activated lipid-linked intermediates prior to glycan transfer. This chapter provides insights into the mechanisms by which cells achieve these functions, focusing particularly on animal cells.","Glucose and fructose are the major carbon and energy sources for organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Most organisms can synthesize the other monosaccharides needed for glycan biosynthesis from these sources. Not all of these biosynthetic pathways are equally active in all types of cells. However, there are some general principles. Monosaccharides must be activated to a high-energy donor for use in glycan synthesis. This process requires nucleoside triphosphates (typically UTP or GTP) and a glycosyl-1-P (monosaccharide with a phosphate at the anomeric carbon). They can be activated by a kinase (reaction 1) or generated from a previously synthesized activated nucleotide sugar (reactions 2 and 3)",0.875,0.6905356573002233,0.6679294074916319,0.125,0.9999999999833333,0.5714285714285714

Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another.'
 'This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose.'
 'The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases.'
 'The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10).'
 'Certain genes may need to be removed and others inserted to create biosynthetic pathways that produce the glycans of interest. Four decades of glycogene discoveries have resulted in the identification of many genes encoding glycosyltransferases, hydrolases, and other enzymes involved in synthesizing and metabolizing the glycans of eukaryotic cells and the biosynthetic pathways involved (Chapters 8–19). Different glycosylation pathways may function independently using different sets of enzymes or, in some cases, may share enzymes. Enzymes working in consecutive order to assemble mature glycans generally work independently, although there may also be cooperative effects. In principle, there is sufficient knowledge to predict the role of individual enzymes and assign them to specific pathways, allowing prediction of the enzyme repertoire required to generate a particular glycan on a particular glycoconjugate. An excellent resource in this regard is the classification of homologous gene families from diverse species in the “Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes” (CAZy) database (Chapter 8).'
 'In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'
 'Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety. The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways.']","In many cases, glycosyltransferases catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor substrate is transferred to the acceptor substrate. These enzymes act sequentially to elongate glycans, with the product of one enzyme serving as the preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent enzyme. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Glycosyltransferases that initiate glycan synthesis transfer monosaccharide moieties to specific substrates, such as proteins, lipids, or other molecules, depending on the type of glycan being synthesized. Additionally, glycosidases play a role in glycan biosynthesis by removing monosaccharides to form intermediates that can be further modified by glycosyltransferases. Other enzymes, such as sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, and acetyltransferases, can also modify glycans to generate diverse glycan structures.","In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter.",1.0,0.6871217113230854,0.8556873606285451,0.0625,0.9999999999833333,0.6
"Complete the following paragraph: Over the years, many theories have been advanced regarding biological roles of glycans. Although there is evidence to support all the theories, exceptions to each one can also be found. This should not be surprising, given the abundance and enormous diversity of glycans in nature. Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them. Biological functions of glycans can be divided into three broad categories:","['The chapter then presents some general principles for understanding and further exploring biological functions of glycans. For details, see the sources cited and other chapters in this book. As with other major classes of macromolecules, the biological functions of glycans span the spectrum from relatively subtle to crucial for development, growth, maintenance, or survival of the organism that synthesizes them. For many glycans, specific functions are not yet evident. The same glycan may also have different functions depending on which aglycone (protein or lipid) it is attached to. Over the years, many theories have been advanced regarding biological roles of glycans. Although there is evidence to support all the theories, exceptions to each one can also be found. This should not be surprising, given the abundance and enormous diversity of glycans in nature. Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them.'
 'Like any biological system, the optimal approach carefully considers the relationship of structure and biosynthesis to function (Chapter 7). As might be imagined from their ubiquitous and complex nature, the biological roles of glycans are remarkably varied. Indeed, asking what these roles are is akin to asking the same question about proteins. Thus, all of the proposed theories regarding glycan function turn out to be partly correct, and exceptions to each can also be found. Not surprisingly for such a diverse group of molecules, the biological roles of glycans also span the spectrum from those that are subtle to those that are crucial for the development, growth, function, or survival of an organism (Chapter 7). The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions.'
 'Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them. Biological functions of glycans can be divided into three broad categories: (1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs]) (Figure 7.1). The GBPs can be subdivided into two groups: (1) intrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from the same organism and (2) extrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from another organism. Intrinsic GBPs typically mediate cell–cell interactions or recognize extracellular molecules, but they can also recognize glycans on the glycocalyx of same cell.'
 'However, such glycans or their modifications are also more likely to be targets for pathogens and toxins. Perhaps as a consequence, intra- and interspecies variations in glycosylation are relatively common, and at least some of the diversity of glycans in nature may represent signatures of past or current host–pathogen or symbiotic interactions (Chapter 20). Finally, genetic defects in glycosylation are easily obtained in cultured cells, but often have limited biological consequences in vitro. In contrast, the same defects often have major and even catastrophic consequences in whole organisms. This generalization indicates that many major functions of glycans are operative mainly within an intact, multicellular organism. Some of these principles are briefly discussed below.'
 'General classification of the biological functions of glycans. A simplified and broad classification is presented, emphasizing the roles of organism-intrinsic and -extrinsic glycan-binding proteins in recognizing glycans. There is some overlap between (more...) Other general principles emerge based on existing literature. The biological consequences of experimentally altering glycosylation in various systems seem to be highly variable and unpredictable. Also, a given glycan can have different roles in different tissues, at different times in development (organism-intrinsic functions) or in different environmental contexts (organism-extrinsic functions). As a broad generalization, it can be stated that terminal sequences, unusual structures, and modifications of glycans are more likely to mediate specific biological functions within the organism. However, such glycans or their modifications are also more likely to be targets for pathogens and toxins.'
 'This generalization indicates that many major functions of glycans are operative mainly within an intact, multicellular organism. Some of these principles are briefly discussed below. Experimental approaches to elucidating biological roles of glycans include prevention of initial glycosylation, prevention of glycan chain elongation, alteration of glycan processing, enzymatic or chemical deglycosylation of completed chains, genetic elimination of glycosylation sites, addition of unnatural monosaccharides, and studies of mutant and naturally occurring genetic variants in glycosylation enzymes. The consequences of such manipulations can range from being essentially undetectable, to the complete loss of particular functions, or even to loss of the entire glycoconjugate bearing the altered glycan. Even within a particular class of molecules (e.g., cell-surface receptors), the effects of altering glycosylation are variable and unpredictable. Moreover, the same glycosylation change can have markedly different effects in different cell types or when studied in vivo or in vitro.'
 'The challenge then is to predict and sort out which distinct roles can be assigned to a given glycan structure in a given cell type and organism. In the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and hosts, pathogens will tend to exploit glycans that are difficult for the host to change (those constrained by their intrinsic host function), and because hosts are unable to alter their glycans easily owing to their slower evolutionary rates and functional constraints of existing glycans, the extrinsic and intrinsic functions of these glycans are bound to overlap. Hosts can, however, to the degree possible, be expected to evolve glycans that are difficult for microbes to mimic, such as the vertebrate-specific sialic acid Neu5Gc (Chapter 15) and sulfated GAGs, prokaryotes do not seem to have reinvented (Chapter 17). Because microorganisms and parasites that bind glycans evolve in parallel with their multicellular hosts, they must adapt their glycan-binding “repertoire” to any change in glycan structure presented by the host.']","structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs]).","(1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs])",1.0,0.7343414012671102,0.9578190492671215,0.022222222222222223,0.9999999999857143,1.0
"Complete the following paragraph: The glycome comprises all the glycan structures synthesized by an organism. It is analogous to the genome, the transcriptome, and/or the proteome but even more dynamic, and it has higher structural complexity that has yet to be fully defined. Cells of different types synthesize a subset of the glycome based on their differentiation state and physiological environment.","['Thus, the glycan complement of a cell depends on which genes are actively transcribed and which transcripts are translated and stably expressed. Transcription, splicing, translation, and posttranslational processing may vary depending on the state of differentiation and the physiological environment of a cell. Therefore, during development and differentiation, and under different environmental conditions, the glycan repertoire of a cell represents a subset of all the glycans that an organism is capable of making. To describe this variation, it is common to qualify the term glycome when referring to the glycans made by a particular tissue or cell type (e.g., T-cell glycome, hepatocyte glycome, or serum glycome), and to note the particular stage of development (e.g., fetal liver glycome, breast cancer serum glycome). The glycome of a given cell in an organism can undergo substantial changes in response to environmental stimuli ranging from pH and ionic strength to hormonal stimulation or inflammation.'
 'Furthermore, unlike the genome, the glycome is sensitive to exogenous nutrient levels and metabolic fluxes including salvage pathways. Thus, variations in dietary monosaccharides, such as glucose, galactose, glucosamine, fucose, mannose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Chapter 15), may change the composition of the glycome. The numerous factors that influence the glycome (the transcriptome, the proteome, environmental nutrients, the secretory machinery, pH, and many other determinants) create a glycome that is highly diverse, adaptable, and dynamic. Thus, the glycome of a cell can change dramatically over time. It is this enormous structural plasticity in response to cellular and environmental states that underlies the essential roles of glycans in development, communication, and disease processes.'
 'Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27). The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward.'
 'This chapter provides a genomic perspective of the genes that code for GTs, GHs, and GBPs. The glycome comprises all the glycan structures synthesized by an organism. It is analogous to the genome, the transcriptome, and/or the proteome but even more dynamic, and it has higher structural complexity that has yet to be fully defined. Cells of different types synthesize a subset of the glycome based on their differentiation state and physiological environment. The human and mouse glycomes have many glycan structures in common, but a few are unique or have divergent functional properties. For example, unlike humans, rodents synthesize cytidine monophospho-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Gc), for the transfer of Neu5Gc to N- and O-glycans (Chapter 15). Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20).'
 'The generation of complex glycan libraries by a variety of routes has further enhanced this interface of chemistry and biology (Chapters 53 and 54), including the generation of glycan microarrays. Analogous to genomics and proteomics, glycomics represents the systematic methodological elucidation of the “glycome” (the totality of glycan structures) of a given cell type or organism (Chapters 51 and 52). In reality, the glycome is far more complex than the genome or proteome. In addition to the vastly greater structural diversity in glycans, one is faced with the complexities of glycosylation microheterogeneity (see above) and the dynamic changes that occur in the course of development, differentiation, metabolic changes, aging, malignancy, inflammation, or infection. Added diversity arises from intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation. Thus, a given cell type in a given species can manifest a large number of possible glycome states.'
 'Clues regarding the composition and complexity of the glycome are found in the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of a cell. Thus, if a gene encoding a glycosyltransferase is not expressed (absent from the transcriptome), no glycans in that cell can carry the sugar transferred by that glycosyltransferase at that particular time. The action of many glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases competing for the same substrates in the biosynthetic pathway renders the complete glycome impossible to predict with current tools and knowledge. As an example, the reduced expression of a single glycosyltransferase can perturb the biosynthesis of dozens of glycans. Furthermore, unlike the genome, the glycome is sensitive to exogenous nutrient levels and metabolic fluxes including salvage pathways.'
 ""Likewise, the glycomes and glycan-binding proteins of microbes and their vertebrate hosts appear to have coevolved in some instances (Chapter 42). The glycome can be determined at different levels of granularity. First, “glycomics” constructs an inventory of glycans separated from their protein or lipid scaffolds from the cell, organ, or organism of interest. This is an important starting point for any comprehensive glycome analysis. The second level of analysis defines specific glycans associated with individual proteins or lipids. Analysis of the complete repertoire of a cell's glycoconjugates, including the microheterogeneity of glycans present at individual sites of attachment, lies, for example, at the intersection of glycomics and proteomics (“glycoproteomics”) and of glycomics and lipidomics (“glycolipidomics”). A third level of complexity involves determining which glycans and/or glycoconjugates are expressed in specific cells, tissues, or secretions at specific times or conditions.""]","The glycome comprises all the glycan structures synthesized by an organism.

Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26).",1.0,0.722098176940513,0.5827134581666511,0.05128205128205128,0.9999999999833333,0.42857142857142855
"Complete the following paragraph: In mammals, there are two different catalytic STT3 subunits that both associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins (homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively).","['The OST complex cleaves the high-energy GlcNAc-P bond, releasing Dol-P-P in the process (Figure 9.3). Yeast OST is comprised of eight different subunits Stt3p, Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost2p, Ost4p, Ost5p, and Ost3p or Ost6p. Stt3p is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The two OST complexes (containing either of the thioredoxin-subunit Ost3p or Ost6p) have a different protein–substrate specificity. The complexity of OST increases in multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are two different catalytic STT3 subunits that both associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins (homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively).'
 'The OST is a complex of multiple subunits of which STT3 is the catalytic subunit that contains OST activity. Two different genes encode STT3—namely, STT3A and STT3B. They are part of two different OST complexes, one with STT3A for cotranslational glycosylation and one with STT3B for glycosylation of proteins that escape glycosylation via the STT3A complex. Patients with defects in either subunit present with the typical multisystem phenotype. Interestingly, transferrin glycosylation is dependent on the STT3A-containing OST complex and thus abnormal in STT3A-CDG, but normal in STT3B-CDG. STT3B dependent protein substrates, such as sex hormone binding globulin, show reduced glycosylation in STT3B-CDG specifically.'
 'The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER. On binding to the catalytic STT3 subunit, the client peptide adopts a 180° turn, making polypeptide folding a competing reaction for N-glycosylation. Indeed, the thioredoxin subunits of the OST complex (Ost3p/Ost6p; MAGT1/TUSC1) modulate the oxidative folding of the client polypeptide, thereby extending the polypeptide substrate range of OST. As of February 2021, the UniProt database reports 1911 N-glycosylation sites in yeast and 13,648 in murine glycoproteins.'
 'OST is a multisubunit protein complex in the ER membrane, except in the case of the kinetoplastids (Chapter 43). OST catalyzes the transfer of the oligosaccharide from Dol-P-P to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in newly synthesized regions of proteins during passage through the translocon into the ER. OST has a high specificity for the completely assembled oligosaccharide, which is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in most eukaryotes. When incomplete oligosaccharides are assembled, transfer efficiency is reduced, resulting in hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins that mature with empty N-glycan sites. All OST subunits are transmembrane proteins with between one and 13 transmembrane domains. The OST complex cleaves the high-energy GlcNAc-P bond, releasing Dol-P-P in the process (Figure 9.3).'
 'The OST of C. jejuni, PglB, is a single polypeptide related to the catalytic STT3 subunits of the multiprotein OST complex of eukaryotes (Chapter 9). PglB shows a more restricted acceptor sequence motif than the eukaryotic N-X-S/T, with requirement of an acidic residue (D/EXNXS/T, in which X cannot be P) (Chapter 21). This places some restrictions on the usefulness of engineering human-like N-glycans, because most N-glycan sites in mammalian proteins do not conform to this extended consensus sequence. PglBs from other species, or mutants evolved by adaptive evolution, have been identified to address this problem, but further improvements are needed. Importantly, PglB has rather relaxed donor substrate specificity. Although bacterial lipid-linked oligosaccharides are distinct from those in eukaryotes, PglB can use mammalian-type lipid-linked oligosaccharides as donors.'
 'The α- and β-subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene, whose 1256 amino acid type-III transmembrane product undergoes proteolysis in the Golgi by site-1-protease (S1P) to give rise to the two subunits, whereas the 305 amino acid γ-subunit is encoded by the GNPTG gene (Figure 33.3). The α/β subunits contain the catalytic function of the enzyme (Stealth domains) as well as elements (Notch1, Notch2, and DMAP [DNA-methylase-associated protein]) that mediate binding to protein determinants present on the lysosomal enzymes. The γ-subunit facilitates the phosphorylation of a subset of the lysosomal enzymes. It contains an M6P receptor homology (MRH) domain that is thought to bind oligomannosyl N-glycans on the lysosomal enzymes and present them to the catalytic site for phosphorylation, and a DMAP recognition domain.'
 'Indeed, O-fucosylation appears to stabilize folded TSRs. The case of Ofut1/POFUT1 is a bit more ambiguous. Studies performed in Drosophila on the efficiency of cell-surface expression of the Ofut1 substrate Notch showed that Ofut1 is required as a chaperone for Notch folding and cell-surface expression, and that chaperone activity is largely independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity. In contrast, POFUT1 does not appear to be absolutely required for cell-surface expression of Notch receptors in all mammalian cells, suggesting that cell-specific chaperones may be able to compensate for loss of POFUT1 in certain contexts. It has been reported recently that O-mannosylation in S. cerevisiae ER might be responsible for terminating futile cycles of association–dissociation between proteins unable to attain their native conformation and Kar2p (the budding yeast homolog of mammalian BiP/Grp78 chaperone).']","These two different catalytic STT3 subunits in mammals, which associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins, are homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively.","The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER.

Sialic acids may be modified by O-acetylation, and Gal and GlcNAc by sulfation. The length of O-GalNAc glycans may vary from a single GalNAc to more than 20 sugar residues and can include blood group and other glycan epitopes. This chapter describes the structures, biosynthesis, and functions of O-GalNAc glycans in mammals. About 150 years ago, E. Eichwald and E. Hoppe-Seyler noted that highly glycosylated proteins that contain hundreds of O-GalNAc glycans, which they termed mucins, are found throughout the body (Figure 10.1).'
 'The termini of O-GalNAc glycans may contain Fuc and Sia in α-linkages, and Gal, GalNAc, and GlcNAc in both α- and β-linkages, and sulfate. Many of these terminal sugars are antigenic or recognized by lectins. In particular, the sialylated and sulfated Lewis antigens are ligands for selectins (Chapter 34), and Gal-terminating structures are ligands for galectins (Chapter 36). Some sugar residues, or their modifications, may mask underlying antigens or receptors. For example, O-acetyl groups on the Sia of the sialyl-Tn antigen prevent recognition by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. Gut bacteria may actively remove this mask. Dense O-glycosylation of mucin domains provides almost complete protection from protease degradation. The O-linkage between GalNAc and Ser/Thr residues is labile under alkaline conditions.'
 'Sialylation blocks the further linear extension of O-glycan chains. Sulfotransferases are localized in the Golgi and cap O-GalNAc glycans with a sulfate ester linked to the 3-position of Gal or the 6-position of GlcNAc. The sulfate group is transferred from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). This adds a negative charge to O-GalNAc glycans of lung, intestinal, and other mucins that has a considerable effect on the chemical and metal ion binding properties of these glycans. GAL3ST4 is the major sulfotransferase acting on the Gal residue of core 1 O-glycans. Skeletal type keratan sulfate (KS) is also an O-GalNAc-linked highly sulfated polysaccharide (Chapter 17). O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized.'
 'O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer. The α1-2 fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 synthesize the blood group H determinant of O-GalNAc glycans which can be converted by an α1-3 Gal-transferase to blood group B or by an α1-3 GalNAc-transferase to blood group A (Table 10.1). In addition, α1-3 and α1-3/4 fucosyltransferases synthesize the Lewis antigens (Table 10.1). A number of uncommon and antigenic sugars are also found on O-GalNAc glycans.'
 'Other sugars are not known to be added to this O-glycan, but it can be O-acetylated by Sia O-acetyltransferase, which prevents detection by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. The addition of one or two neutral sugars to O-GalNAc generates one of the different cores of O-GalNAc glycans (Table 10.1; Figure 10.2). Core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) is generated by C1GALT1. This activity is present in most cell types but absolutely requires the molecular chaperone C1GALT1C1 (COSMC) during synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mammalian cells to ensure proper folding and activity in the Golgi.'
 'The addition of GalNAc to Gal already substituted with α2-3Sia may also occur on glycoproteins and glycolipids (Figure 14.10). On glycoproteins, this structure forms the human Sda blood group, which is expressed by most individuals. In mice, the Sda antigen was first described on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and was termed the CT antigen. On glycolipids, the same trisaccharide terminus is shared by the ganglioside GM2 (Chapter 11). A related structure to the Sda antigen GalNAcβ1-4(Neu5Acα2-3)Galβ1-3(Neu5Acα2-6)GalNAc is found in O-glycans and glycolipids. The human Sda antigen was first sequenced in N-glycans of Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein from human urine.'

It discusses the variability in the length of O-GalNAc glycans, ranging from a single GalNAc to over 20 sugar residues, which can encompass blood group and other glycan epitopes. Additionally, it highlights the potential modifications of sialic acids through O-acetylation and the sulfation of Gal and GlcNAc within O-GalNAc glycans.","About 150 years ago, E. Eichwald and E. Hoppe-Seyler noted that highly glycosylated proteins that contain hundreds of O-GalNAc glycans, which they termed mucins, are found throughout the body (Figure 10.1). Since then we have learned that O-GalNAc glycans are not only found as dense clusters on mucins, but also at single sites on most secreted and membrane-bound proteins. O-GalNAc glycans are involved in almost every aspect of biology, including cell–cell communication, cell adhesion, signal transduction, immune surveillance, epithelial cell protection, and host–pathogen interactions.",0.8333333333333334,0.729818449098266,0.7516324100111827,0.02564102564102564,0.7928571428373213,0.3333333333333333

Animal cells synthesize various sphingosines and related long-chain amino alcohols, together referred to as sphingoid bases. Nearly all glycolipids in vertebrates are GSLs, which, in turn, are part of the larger family of sphingolipids (lipids built on sphingoid bases) that includes the major membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, and the second messenger sphingosine 1-phosphate that regulates angiogenesis and immune cell trafficking. Other GSLs were later identified because they accumulate to pathological levels in tissues of patients with lysosomal storage diseases, genetic disorders in which glycan degrading enzymes are faulty or missing (Chapter 44).'
 'In comparison, glycoglycerolipids, (more...) Glycoglycerolipids are distinguished from GSLs by their lipid, having glycans linked to the C-3 hydroxyl of diacylglycerol or alkyl(acyl)glycerol (Figure 11.1). Very minor constituents of most animal tissues (other than the testes), glycoglycerolipids are widely distributed in microbes and plants. Glycolipids of fungi, plants, and invertebrates are covered in Chapters 20 and 23–26. Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), a different family of glycolipids, are often attached to proteins as membrane, and may also exist as free glycolipids (discussed in Chapter 12). The lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria are discussed in Chapter 21. The ceramide lipid of GSLs consists of a sphingoid base with a fatty acid amide at the C-2 amine.'
 'The emphasis of this chapter is on vertebrate glycosphingolipids. Information on glycolipids of fungi, plants, and invertebrates is covered elsewhere (Chapters 20 and 23–26), as are glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), glycolipids attached to proteins as membrane anchors (Chapter 12). This chapter describes the characteristic features of GSLs, pathways for their biosynthesis, and insights into their biological roles in membrane structure, host–pathogen interactions, cell–cell recognition, and modulation of membrane protein function. The first GSL to be characterized was galactosylceramide (GalCer). Among the simplest of glycolipids, it is also one of the most abundant molecules in the vertebrate brain. It consists of a single galactose residue in β-glycosidic linkage to the C-1 hydroxyl group of a lipid moiety called ceramide (Figure 11.1).'
 'The ceramide lipid of GSLs consists of a sphingoid base with a fatty acid amide at the C-2 amine. Sphingosine is the most common sphingoid base in mammals, with hydroxyls at the C-1 and C-3 carbons and a trans double bond between C-4 and C-5 (Figure 11.1). Sphinganine is the same structure without the double bond, and phytosphingosine lacks the double bond and has an additional hydroxyl on C-4. Ceramides containing sphinganine and phytosphingosine are less abundant in animals, whereas phytosphingosine is prominent in the glycosphingolipids of plants and fungi. The fatty acid components of ceramides vary widely, with lengths ranging from C14 to C30 or greater. Although often saturated, they may be variably unsaturated or have α-hydroxyl groups.'
 'Sialylated GalCer (Neu5Acα2-3GalβCer; GM4) is also found in myelin. These galactolipids are seldom extended with larger saccharide chains; rather, most other members of the large and diverse family of GSLs in animals are built on GlcCer (Figure 11.2). GlcCer itself is abundant in certain tissues. In skin, it is a precursor of special ceramides that are required for creating the essential surface water barrier when embedded into the stratum corneum of the epidermis (see below). Glycosphingolipid (GSL) neutral cores and their designation based on IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) Nomenclature.'
 'In contrast, lacto-series glycolipids are prominent in secretory organs and globo-series glycolipids are the most abundant in erythrocytes. This diversity presumably reflects important differences in GSL functions. GSLs are further subclassified as neutral (no charged sugars or ionic groups), sialylated (having one or more sialic acid residues), or sulfated. Traditionally, all sialylated GSLs are known as “gangliosides” regardless of whether they are based on the ganglio-series neutral sugar core. In the official nomenclature, saccharide and other substituents that extend or branch from the neutral core structures are indicated by a roman numeral designating which of the neutral core sugars carries the substituent (counting the sugar closest to the ceramide as “I”), and a superscript designating which hydroxyl on that sugar is modified (Figure 11.2).'
 'In certain lysosomal storage diseases (Chapter 44), mutations in activator proteins result in pathological accumulation of glycolipids, even though there is an abundance of the hydrolase responsible for degradation, thus demonstrating the essential role of activator proteins in GSL catabolism in vivo. The final breakdown products of GSL catabolism—monosaccharides, fatty acids, and free sphingoid bases—are then available for reuse by salvage pathways. GSLs comprise from <5% (erythrocytes) to >20% (myelin) of the total membrane lipids in the plasma membranes of vertebrate cells. However, they are not uniformly distributed in the plane of the membrane but cluster in “lipid rafts,” small lateral microdomains of self-associating membrane molecules.']","Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are a major type of glycolipids found in vertebrates, which are part of the broader family of sphingolipids. This group of lipids, built on sphingoid bases, includes sphingomyelin, a major membrane phospholipid, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, a second messenger that plays a role in regulating processes such as angiogenesis and immune cell trafficking.","Other GSLs were later identified because they accumulate to pathological levels in tissues of patients with lysosomal storage diseases, genetic disorders in which glycan degrading enzymes are faulty or missing (Chapter 44). For example, a sialic acid–containing GSL (GM2) was first isolated from the brain of a victim of Tay–Sachs disease, in which it accumulates, and was named “ganglioside” based on its location in nerve clusters or “ganglia” in the brain. Likewise, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was first isolated from the spleen of a Gaucher disease patient, where it accumulates. As purification, separation, and analytical techniques improved, GSLs were found in all vertebrate tissues. Hundreds of unique GSL structures were found that vary in glycan structures alone, each of which are presented on several distinct ceramides. Structures of representative glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and glycoglycerolipids.

Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-protein anchors were first postulated in the mid-1970s when highly purified bacterial PI-specific PLCs were observed to release proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase, from mammalian plasma membranes.'
 'GPIs are one of the rare instances in which GlcN is found without either an N-acetyl or N-sulfate (as in proteoglycans) moiety (Chapter 17). General structure of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors attached to proteins. All characterized GPI anchors share a common core consisting of ethanolamine-PO4-6Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcNα1-6myo-inositol-1-PO4-lipid. (more...) Beyond the common core, the structures of mature GPI anchors are quite diverse, depending on both the protein to which they are attached and the organism in which they are synthesized (Figure 12.1; Online Appendix 12B). Modifications to the core include additional EtNP and a wide variety of linear and branched glycosyl substituents of largely unknown function. There is considerable variation in the PI moiety.'
 'The substructure Manα1-4GlcNα1-6myo-inositol-1-P-lipid is a universal hallmark of GPI anchors and related structures. All but one protein-linked GPI anchor share a larger common core structure (Figure 12.1; Online Appendix 12B, panels I–IV). The protein–carbohydrate association in GPI-APs is unique in that the reducing terminus of the GPI oligosaccharide is not attached to the protein but to the D-myo-inositol head group of a PI moiety by an α1-6 linkage. A distal, nonreducing mannose (Man) is attached to the protein via an ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) bridge between its C-6 hydroxyl and the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy-terminal amino acid.'
 'Similarly, GPI-anchored CD14 (the LPS/LPS-binding protein receptor) requires to partner transmembrane Toll-like receptor-4, and can function equally well with a GPI anchor or with a spliced transmembrane domain. The replacement of carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains of type-I integral membrane proteins by GPIsps allows their expression as GPI-APs on the plasma membrane of transfected mammalian cells. This offers a useful method for producing soluble forms of membrane proteins. For example, the T-cell receptor was rendered soluble after it was expressed in the GPI-anchored form (by the action of bacterial PI-PLC), and not by simply expressing the transmembrane-deleted domain. In addition, purified GPI-APs can be used to coat hydrophobic surface plasmon resonance chips, thus providing a convenient method for orienting and presenting proteins for binding studies. It is clear that purified GPI-APs will spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers.'
 'The range of described GPI-APs and the distribution of putative GPI biosynthesis genes suggests that (1) GPI anchors are almost ubiquitous among eukaryotes; (2) GPI-APs are functionally diverse and include hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion molecules, complement regulatory proteins, receptors, protozoan coat proteins, and prion proteins; and (3) in mammals, alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing may lead to the expression of transmembrane and/or soluble and GPI-anchored forms of the same gene product. These variants may be developmentally regulated. For example, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) exists in GPI-anchored and soluble forms when expressed in muscle and in GPI-anchored and two transmembrane forms when expressed in brain. The substructure Manα1-4GlcNα1-6myo-inositol-1-P-lipid is a universal hallmark of GPI anchors and related structures.'
 'It is clear that purified GPI-APs will spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers. The physiological significance of direct GPI-protein exchange between membranes is still uncertain, particularly because all mammals express potent GPI-PLD activity in serum that can remove the lipid (phosphatidic acid) component of the anchor and, thus, prevent GPI-protein re-insertion. However, the re-insertion property of GPI-APs has been exploited experimentally to “paint” exogenous proteins onto cell surfaces. GPI anchors are essential for life in some, but not all, eukaryotic microbes. In S. cerevisiae, and probably most fungi, the presence of a GPI anchor targets certain mannoproteins for covalent incorporation into the β-glucan layer of the cell wall via a transglycosylation reaction, whereby Man-1 within the GPI-anchor core is transferred to the β-glucan polymer, probably by the actions of Dfg5 and Dcw1.'
 'It follows that inositol-acylated GPI proteins with three fatty-acid chains should be more stably associated. On the other hand, Leishmania LPG, with a single C24:0 alkyl chain, has a half-life of only minutes at the cell surface and is secreted intact into the medium. The thermodynamics of bilayer interactions also depend on the length and degree of saturation of the fatty-acid chains. In this regard, the saturated nature of most (but not all) mammalian GPI anchors (Online Appendix 12B, panels III and IV) is thought to explain why GPI-APs associate with “lipid rafts.” The current model for mammalian lipid rafts is that of transient liquid-ordered nanoclusters of membrane components. These are dependent on dynamic cortical actin asters that, through adaptor proteins, cluster phosphatidylserine (PS) on the inner face of the plasma membrane bilayer.']","Proteins attached to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) via their carboxyl termini are generally found in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer facing the extracellular environment.

Two classes of canonical ligands bind to and activate Notch signaling in Drosophila: Delta and Serrate.'
 'Some ER glycosylation enzymes are synthesized as soluble proteins.

Like EGF repeats, TSRs are found in a subset of cell-surface and secreted proteins in metazoans, and they appear to function in protein–protein interactions.

 'Homologs of POGLUT1, termed POGLUT2 and POGLUT3, are responsible for modifying this site. The O-glucose at this site has not been reported to be elongated past the monosaccharide. Although β-linked O-GlcNAc is very common on proteins in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments (Chapter 19), the same modification can be found in comparatively few membrane and secreted proteins. Addition of O-GlcNAc occurs between the fifth and sixth conserved Cys of an EGF repeat at the putative consensus C5XXXX(S/T)GX2-3C6 (Figure 13.1A) in mouse and Drosophila Notch.

 'Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms. They then make their way via an intermediate compartment (IC) through multiple stacks of the Golgi apparatus, finally being distributed to various destinations from the trans-Golgi network (TGN).']","Proteins with EGF repeats harboring O-glycans include several involved in blood clot formation and dissolution, and the Notch family of receptors and canonical Notch ligands (Delta and Serrate/Jagged) involved in cell fate decisions.

 'The “type and cross” procedures have virtually eliminated ABO blood group transfusion reactions in the developed world. Attempts are being made to enzymatically modify A or B erythrocytes using glycosidases to remove GalNAc (A) and/or Gal (B), in order to convert them to “O”, the “universal donor” type. The few individuals with AB type are “universal acceptors.” In addition to accurately typing AB blood types, A1 and A2 blood group distinctions are important clinically as A2 individuals can generate anti-A1 antibodies, although these antibodies are often not clinically meaningful. Furthermore, when crossing ABO(H) barriers during solid organ transplantation, A2 donor organs have better overall survival when compared to A1 following transplantation into a blood group O or B recipient; this is presumably because of the lower expression of the A antigen in A2 individuals. In addition to transfusion and transplantation, ABO(H) alloantigens are some of the most frequent allogeneic barriers crossed during fetal development.'
 'These and other less prominent glycan antigens can cause hemolytic transfusion and rejection reactions, mostly because of errors in blood typing. Although anti-A and anti-B titers likely influence transfusion and transplantation outcomes, simple assessment of antibody levels fails to fully account for the clinical impact(s) of an ABO(H) incompatible transfusion. Efforts to generate “universal donor” red blood cells, via enzymatic conversion of blood group A and B antigens to the O state using bacterial enzymes, are underway. Occasionally, patients with diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma spontaneously secrete a circulating anticoagulant and have an unusual coagulation test profile that makes it appear as if the patient has been treated with heparin. The anticoagulant activity can be purified from the plasma and has been identified as an HS glycosaminoglycan. Its source is unknown and therapy is difficult without correcting the underlying disease or transplanting the liver.'
 'Interestingly, plant lectins were used historically to aid in typing blood. For example, the lectin from Dolichos biflorus agglutinates erythrocytes from most blood group A individuals (termed A1 individuals), but it does not agglutinate erythrocytes from individuals of the A2 subgroup, and it is still used currently to distinguish individuals with these two different blood types. The A1 and A2 subgroup antigens are distinct (Figure 14.5) reflecting the different A transferases encoded by the A1 versus A2 allele at the ABO locus. Heritable erythrocyte antigenic polymorphisms determined by the ABO locus have important medical implications. Early in the postnatal period, the immune system generates IgM antibodies against ABO antigen(s), even though they are absent from erythrocytes. This is because glycan antigens similar or identical to the A and B blood group determinants are carried by colonizing bacteria and fungi.'
 'This was the first example of antibody-mediated immunosuppression clinically and formed the basis of highly successful anti-RhD formularies designed to prevent Rh alloimmunization and therefore hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Cross-matching procedures helped to identify a rare ABO blood group phenotype termed the Bombay phenotype, so named because the first identified individual lived in that city (now Mumbai). Affected persons have erythrocytes and tissue cells lacking A, B, and H determinants because they have inactive FUT1 and FUT2 genes, and therefore no α1-2FucT enzyme. Bombay sera contain IgM antibodies that react with erythrocytes from virtually all donors, including O erythrocytes (H antigen-positive, A and B antigen-negative). They show robust titers of anti-H, anti-A, and anti-B IgM antibodies and cannot receive erythrocytes from any donor except those of the same Bombay blood type.'
 'In addition to transfusion and transplantation, ABO(H) alloantigens are some of the most frequent allogeneic barriers crossed during fetal development. IgG anti-A,B antibodies present in blood group O mothers, which react with the A and B antigen, can cross the placenta and engage A or B antigens on the surface of fetal red blood cells (RBCs). However, unlike IgG antibodies against other alloantigens, such as RhD, IgG anti-A,B antibodies rarely cause life-threatening anemia in a fetus or neonate, presumably because of the relatively low level of A and B antigen expression present on fetal RBCs. However, despite the lower level of A and B expression on fetal RBCs, anti-A and anti-B antibodies present in maternal circulation can rapidly remove A or B positive fetal RBCs following exposure during parturition, reducing the probability of alloimmunization to other alloantigens.']","Erythrocytes of compatible units do not agglutinate, whereas incompatibility is indicated by agglutinated erythrocytes formed by antibodies in the patient's serum.

 'As with the glycome, each cell type in each species expresses its own distinct sialome. For example, although mammalian liver sialoglycans are most abundant on glycoproteins, brain sialoglycans are much more abundant as sialoglycolipids (Chapter 11), so much so that they are termed “gangliosides” for the nerve ganglia on which they were discovered. The sialome also varies markedly in response to environmental cues. Sias can also exist as internally linked structures rather than on termini of glycans. In vertebrates, the terminal Sia of a glycan chain is rarely extended further, except with another Sia (Figure 15.3). Among bacteria, Sias and the related NulOs can also be found in diverse cellular structures, including capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharide O-antigens or as part of flagella, pili, or structures such as the cell wall or S-layer (Chapter 21).'
 'Similar 9-carbon backbone 2-keto acid monosaccharides were later discovered in some bacterial lipopolysaccharides and initially called “bacterial sialic acids.” The resulting confusion was resolved by suggesting that the term “sialic acid” (Sia) be limited to its original use in describing neuraminic acid (Neu), Kdn, and their derivatives in deuterostomes and their pathogens, and that the term “nonulosonic acid” (NulO) be used to encompass the entire group of 9-carbon backbone non-2-ulosonic acids (Figure 15.1). Base structures representing the larger family of NulO molecules are shown in Figure 15.1 for comparison. This chapter will largely deal with the biology, metabolism, and functions of Sias in mammals. The evolution, distribution, and functions of the larger family of NulOs are briefly described toward the end of this chapter.'
 'Clustered sialoglycans along the polypeptide chain can also protect the underlying protein from proteases. Membrane-bound sialoglycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are often quite dense, provide cell surface anionic charge that acts as a barrier and regulates cell surface functions. An extreme example of these biophysical effects is polySia, whose functional impacts are detailed above. Given Sia abundance on cell surfaces (see Figure 15.3), it is not surprising that numerous animal pathogens evolved to target these molecules. Indeed, highly specific Sia-binding proteins were first discovered on human pathogens and their toxins. In the search for host cell receptors for influenza viruses, it was discovered that isolated viruses cross-linked red blood cells, resulting in hemagglutination. Over time, the red cells dispersed and could no longer be agglutinated by fresh viruses.'
 'Such modifications can determine or modify recognition by Sia-binding proteins and direct Sia function. Despite this complexity, it may be sufficient in some biological studies to simply know that a generic Sia residue is present at the terminal position of a glycan under study (a red diamond in the symbol nomenclature system) (Figure 15.2). Dehydro-Sias also exist in nature. For example, Neu2en5Ac (2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid, sometimes called DANA) has natural inhibitory properties toward sialidases and was the starting point for the design of more potent inhibitors such as the anti-influenza drug Relenza (Chapter 57). Hierarchical levels of sialome complexity.'
 'Sias liberated by sialidases at mucosal sites also provide nutrients for some bacteria or provide access to underlying carbohydrates. Viral neuraminidases facilitate release and spreading of newly formed viruses, and specific viral neuraminidase inhibitors are widely used as the antiviral drugs such as anti-influenza A virus drugs Relenza and Tamiflu (Chapter 42). Once a free Sia molecule is released in the lysosome of a vertebrate cell, it is returned to the cytosol by a specific exporter (SLC17A5, also called Sialin), in which it is either reused or degraded. Human mutations in Sialin cause Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disease, resulting in accumulation of Sia in lysosomes and excretion of excess Sia in the urine. Some pathogens scavenge Sias from the extracellular space, using high-efficiency transporters to concentrate them from trace levels.'
 'They are also essential components of recognition molecules, with roles that vary according to cell type, tissue type, and species. The first mammalian Sia-binding protein found was the complement regulatory molecule factor H, a soluble serum factor that binds cell-surface Sias and protects cells from autoimmune attack, providing recognition of “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), which are also recognized by CD33-related Siglecs (Chapter 35). Human mutations in the Sia-binding site of factor H result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, a disease caused by excessive complement activation, because of the failure of factor H function. Other variations of the factor H polyanion binding region increase the risk of age-dependent macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness resulting from inflammation in the eye retina. Sias are also involved in interactions of white blood cells with the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Circulating neutrophils must bind to and move across the blood vessel wall to clear bacterial infections in tissues.']","Sias, also known as sialic acids, play crucial roles in various cellular functions due to their presence on vertebrate cells. They contribute to functions such as repulsion of cell-cell interactions, protein stabilization, ion binding, and ion transport. The early nomenclature of these molecules stems from their discovery by Gunnar Blix and Ernst Klenk in the 1930s and 1940s, with Blix naming his discovery ""sialic acid"" and Klenk naming his ""neuraminic acid.""","Although 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sometimes called “NANA”) is the most common sialic acid (Sia) in humans, the Sia family is comprised of related structures (Figure 15.1) that vary at the C-5 carbon, including 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (also known as 3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid, or Kdn) with a hydroxyl group at C-5.

Large hyaluronan polymers in the extracellular space can be internalized following interaction with cell-surface receptors that trigger endocytosis, which may be facilitated by the membrane-associated hyaluronidases, HYAL2 and/or TMEM2, or through association with CEMIP. The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The importance of the turnover process for growth and survival is demonstrated by the respective embryonic lethal phenotypes in animal models. Hyal2-null mice and Tmem2-deficient zebrafish both suffer embryonic lethality as a result of cardiac developmental defects.'
 'Hyal2-null mice and Tmem2-deficient zebrafish both suffer embryonic lethality as a result of cardiac developmental defects. CEMIP is important for clearing hyaluronan accumulation during bacterial infection in mice. In humans, a lysosomal storage disorder was found to result from mutation of HYAL1 (Chapter 44). Hyaluronan fragments have been suggested to act as an endogenous signal of injury, or during infection by Group A Streptococcus, which contains a hyaluronan capsule. The signaling activity of hyaluronan fragments is mediated through binding of cell-surface receptors, such as CD44, which in turn modulates response through Toll-like receptors. Signaling through these and other receptors is affected by the size of the hyaluronan fragments, but the mechanism underlying the dependence of activity on the size of the fragments remains an area of active research. Hyaluronan has multiple roles in early development, tissue organization, and cell proliferation.'
 'Cytochemical studies using naturally occurring proteins with high-affinity binding to hyaluronic acid have been used to document accumulation of hyaluronic acid in the nuclei of cultured cells. In response to inflammatory conditions, such as hypoglycemia, cells appear to synthesize hyaluronan in intracellular compartments. After cell division, the intracellular hyaluronan is extruded outside cells in cables that recruit inflammatory cells initiating a stress response. Mechanistically, this is likely caused by a redistribution of the hyaluronan synthases to intracellular membranes from the plasma membrane, across which hyaluronic acid is normally extruded (Figure 18.1N). Notably, hyaluronic acid–binding proteins naturally occur within the nucleus raising the possibility of a physiological role for nuclear hyaluronan via interaction with these hyaluronic acid–binding proteins.'
 'The AMR internalizes its ligands captured at the cell surface at physiological pH; via coated pits, the AMR in complex with its ligand is internalized into coated vesicles (Figure 34.4), and changes in pH in late endosomes lead to dissociation of Ca++ from the AMR and release of ligand. The uncomplexed AMR then recycles to the plasma membrane, whereas the ligand is delivered to lysosomes where it is degraded. For some nonrecycling receptors (e.g., dendritic cell [DC]-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin [DC-SIGN]), both the ligand and receptor are targeted to lysosomes and degraded. Internalization of ligands by the AMR in hepatocytes is rapid, occurring in 2–3 minutes, and the receptor recycles to the surface within 4–5 minutes. The efficiency of the AMR in endocytosis has led it to be a target for gene therapy and delivery of molecules to hepatocytes.'
 'Hyaluronan signaling in health and disease. CD44, cluster of differentiation antigen, a type I transmembrane receptor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HARE, hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis; LYVE-1, lymphatic vessel endothelial (more...) Toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4, which are components of the innate immune system responsive to bacterial pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been found to signal differentially in response to the generation of hyaluronan oligosaccharides by hyaluronidase. Depending on cell type, this may occur through direct binding of the hyaluronan oligosaccharides by TLR2/4. Alternatively, because hyaluronan encapsulation can obstruct access of TLR2/4 by other known ligands, hyaluronidase-mediated capsule degradation can also facilitate TLR2/4 activation by allowing other ligands to bind.'
 'Thus, RHAMM is also a nonmotor spindle assembly factor. Hyaluronan binding to RHAMM activates SRC, FAK, ERK (extracellular mitogen-regulated protein kinase), and PKC (protein tyrosine kinase C) (Chapter 40). These pathways are relevant to tumor cell survival and invasion; their inhibition by hyaluronan oligomers and soluble hyaluronan-binding proteins suggests novel therapeutic approaches for treating cancer (Chapter 47). Some pathogenic bacteria (e.g., certain strains of Streptococcus and Pasteurella) produce hyaluronan as an extracellular capsule; also see Chapter 21). Capsular hyaluronan, like other capsular polysaccharides, increases virulence by helping to shield the microbe from host defenses. For example, the capsule blocks phagocytosis and protects against complement-mediated killing. Because bacterial hyaluronan is identical in structure to host hyaluronan, the capsule can also prevent the formation of protective antibodies.'
 'HARE is expressed on the cell surface of a variety of sinusoidal endothelial cell types, where it is capable of binding hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycan ligands, subsequently triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis and thereby clearing these components from circulation. Signaling occurs optimally during uptake of 50- to 250-kDa hyaluronan; smaller or larger hyaluronan does not activate signaling and blocks signaling by 50- to 250-kDa hyaluronan. Signaling through both TLR2/4 and HARE activate NF-κB and promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cytokines. CD44 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by many cell types, and it varies markedly in glycosylation, oligomerization, and protein sequence because of differential mRNA splicing. CD44 contains a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane segment, and an ectodomain with a single link module that can bind hyaluronan.']","The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.","The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.",1.0,0.6451614244891031,1.0000000000000004,0.02631578947368421,0.8095238094968253,1.0

After xylose addition, a linkage tetrasaccharide assembles by the transfer of two galactose residues catalyzed by unique members of the β4 galactosyl-, β3 galactosyl-, and β3 glucuronosyltransferase families of enzymes (Figure 17.4). This intermediate can undergo phosphorylation at the C-2 position of xylose and in the case of chondroitin sulfate, sulfation of the galactose residues. In general, phosphorylation and sulfation occur substoichiometrically, but phosphorylation may be transient. Phosphorylation occurs early in the assembly process and creates the preferred substrate for B4GALT7; a phosphatase removes the phosphate at a later stage of biosynthesis. The function of galactose sulfation in chondroitin sulfate remains unclear.'
 'Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF), a protein that lacks independent activity but collaborates with the polymerases to enhance the formation of polymers. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 17.5). Biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate involves the polymerization of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid units and a series of modification reactions including O-sulfation and epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid.'
 'Chst1 and 5 can add sulfate groups at the indicated positions. The actual order of the various sulfated and nonsulfated (more...) Two classes of glycosaminoglycan chains—chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate/heparin—are linked to serine residues in proteins by way of xylose (Figure 17.4). Xylosyltransferase initiates the process using UDP-xylose as donor. Two isoforms of the enzyme are known in vertebrates (XYLT1 and XYLT2), but only one isozyme exists in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. A glycine residue invariably lies to the carboxy-terminal side of the serine attachment site, but a perfect consensus sequence for xylosylation does not exist. At least two acidic amino acid residues are usually present, and they can be located on one or both sides of the serine, usually within a few residues.'
 'In contrast, invertebrates such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster make either nonsulfated or low sulfated chains. The assembly process for the backbone appears to be highly conserved, based on the presence of homologous genes for all of the reactions (Chapters 25 and 26). As described above, the assembly process is initiated by the transfer of GalNAcβ3 to the linkage tetrasaccharide (Figure 17.4). In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the polymerization step is catalyzed by one or more bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both β3 glucuronosyltransferase and β4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain.'
 '6-O-Sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine occurs on the nonreducing terminal residue, encouraging further chain elongation, whereas sulfation of galactose residues takes place on nonreducing terminal and internal galactose residues, with a preference for galactose units adjacent to a sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residue. Sulfation of a nonreducing terminal galactose residue blocks further elongation of the chain, providing a potential mechanism for controlling chain length. The poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains of KS I are generally longer than those of KS II and may contain up to 50 disaccharide units (20–25 kDa). The chains can be fucosylated and sialylated as well (Chapter 14). Vertebrate chondroitin sulfate consists of repeating sulfate-substituted GalNAcβ4GlcAβ3 disaccharides polymerized into long chains (Figure 17.2).'
 'The enzyme transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac. As such, it is the sialytransferase-mediated delivery of 9-O-acetylated sialic to acceptor substrates that leads to the 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates observed. 9-O-acetylated sialic acid plays a role in CD22 signaling, a process regulated by the opposing action of a sialate 9-O-acetylesterase (SIAE). It also serves as receptor or coreceptor for influenza C and a number of coronaviruses. N-Deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine residues to glucosamine occurs during heparin/heparan sulfate formation (Chapter 17), lipopolysaccharide assembly (Chapters 21 and 22), and GPI-anchor synthesis (Chapter 12). The bacterial enzyme is zinc-dependent, but in-depth studies of the vertebrate N-deacetylases have not been performed.']","In chondroitin assembly, genetic evidence from studies of C. elegans indicates that N-acetylgalactosamine addition is mediated by the same enzyme involved in chain polymerization (Sqv5). However, biochemical evidence suggests that more than one enzyme may exist in vertebrates.

"Complete the following paragraph: Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent.","['The enzyme was first identified and purified from rat liver and subsequently cloned from rat, human, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other organisms. OGT resides on the X chromosome (Xq13 in humans) near the centromere and is among the most highly conserved proteins from worms to man. Mutations in OGT, both in its tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and in its catalytic domain, cause X-linked intellectual disability in humans. To date, three isoforms of OGT have been well characterized: (1) the nucleocytoplasmic or full-length variant (ncOGT), which is 110 kDa; (2) a short isoform of OGT (sOGT), which is 78 kDa; and (3) a variant of OGT that is targeted to the mitochondria (mOGT; ∼90 kDa).'

An example of bacterial monoglycosylation that leads to a known function comes from the EF-P protein, the bacterial homolog of eukaryotic elongation initiation factor 5a. In some bacteria, EF-P suppresses translational stalling by a mechanism that involves oxidation of a critical lysyl residue, and its eukaryotic ortholog is regulated by hypusylation.'
 'In the nucleus and cytoplasm, OGT appears to form multimers, consisting of one or more 110-kDa subunits and 78-kDa subunits. Several useful small molecule inhibitors of OGT have been developed, including OSMI-4b, Ac45SGlcNAc, and 5SGlcNHex, with the latter effective in animal models. However, some off-target effects have been reported for these inhibitors, likely because they impact other enzymes that use UDP-GlcNAc. ncOGT has two distinct domains separated by a putative nuclear localization sequence. The amino terminus of each OGT subunit contains TPRs, which can number up to 13 (species-dependent). The major variation between the three (above) variants is in the number of the TPRs.'
 'The highly homologous and conserved nature of OGT among metazoans allows a transgene encoding the human sequence of OGT to be used to rescue OGT null Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, OGA has been disrupted in both C. elegans and mammalian models. Like the OGT null, the C. elegans OGA null has defective carbohydrate metabolism and abnormalities in dauer formation. In contrast to the OGT null, in C. elegans in which OGA has been disrupted, the worms have an extended life span. In murine models, deletion of OGA leads to perinatal lethality, genomic instability and severe epigenetic and metabolic phenotypes. The OGA heterozygous mouse shows widespread changes in transcription and metabolism, and an enhanced dependence on glucose metabolism. Studies from numerous laboratories have described O-GlcNAcylated proteins from virtually all cellular compartments, representing nearly all functional classes of protein (Figure 19.2; Table 19.1).'
 'Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26).'
 'A splicing variant is also found in animal mitochondria in which O-GlcNAcylation is found on respiratory enzymes. A highly related enzyme lineage, termed O-fucosyltransferase (OFT), mediates the addition of O-fucose (O-Fuc) to dozens of nucleocytoplasmic proteins in plants, numerous protists, and possibly bacteria. The OFT was first discovered genetically in plants as Spy, in which it controls transcriptional processes. In the protist pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, OFT modifies numerous proteins involved in transcription, mRNA biogenesis, nuclear transport, and cell signaling. Recently, Greb1, derived from another lineage of enzymes, was shown to O-β-GlcNAcylate estrogen receptor-α and potentially other nuclear proteins, which if verified is an interesting example of convergent evolution.'
 'However, to date no OGA ortholog has been identified in plants or protozoans. Plants encode two OGT paralogs: SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPY. Curiously, whereas SEC encodes an O-GlcNAc transferase, SPY encodes a fucosyltransferase. Notably, the SPY paralog in Dictyostelium discoideum, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Toxoplasma gondii also fucosylates proteins. To date, O-GlcNAc and the enzymes that control its cycling do not appear to exist in yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

Sequence and structural analyses reveal that OGA contains an amino-terminal hexosaminidase domain and a carboxy-terminal domain, with homology to GCN5 histone acetyltransferases (HAT), separated by an intervening sequence. OGA forms an unusual arm-in-arm homodimer that is mediated by a helix within the intervening sequence. Dimerization is critical for activity and the formation of a substrate binding cleft.

 'The highly homologous and conserved nature of OGT among metazoans allows a transgene encoding the human sequence of OGT to be used to rescue OGT null Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, OGA has been disrupted in both C. elegans and mammalian models. Like the OGT null, the C. elegans OGA null has defective carbohydrate metabolism and abnormalities in dauer formation. In contrast to the OGT null, in C. elegans in which OGA has been disrupted, the worms have an extended life span. In murine models, deletion of OGA leads to perinatal lethality, genomic instability and severe epigenetic and metabolic phenotypes. The OGA heterozygous mouse shows widespread changes in transcription and metabolism, and an enhanced dependence on glucose metabolism. Studies from numerous laboratories have described O-GlcNAcylated proteins from virtually all cellular compartments, representing nearly all functional classes of protein (Figure 19.2; Table 19.1).'
 'The enzyme was first identified and purified from rat liver and subsequently cloned from rat, human, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other organisms. OGT resides on the X chromosome (Xq13 in humans) near the centromere and is among the most highly conserved proteins from worms to man. Mutations in OGT, both in its tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and in its catalytic domain, cause X-linked intellectual disability in humans. To date, three isoforms of OGT have been well characterized: (1) the nucleocytoplasmic or full-length variant (ncOGT), which is 110 kDa; (2) a short isoform of OGT (sOGT), which is 78 kDa; and (3) a variant of OGT that is targeted to the mitochondria (mOGT; ∼90 kDa).'
 'Like OGT, OGA is thought to be regulated by its protein interactors, posttranslational modifications, and localization. OGA can be efficiently inhibited in vitro and in vivo by a panel of highly effective inhibitors. Although many inhibitors display some cross-reactivity toward the lysosomal hexosaminidases, GlcNAcstatin B and Thiamet-G are selective for OGA. Unlike the relatively static nature of mature N- and O-glycans on glycoproteins, O-GlcNAc cycles rapidly on and off most substrates. Early studies showed that mitogen or antigen activation of lymphocytes rapidly decreased O-GlcNAcylation of many cytoplasmic proteins, but concomitantly increased O-GlcNAcylation of many nuclear proteins. Likewise, neutrophils were shown to rapidly modulate O-GlcNAcylation of several proteins in response to chemotactic agents.'
 'In contrast, Pasteurella synthesizes hyaluronan by an enzyme that is unrelated to hasA and the mammalian Has gene family. In this case, the enzyme has two separable domains with independent glycosyltransferase activities—one for UDP-GlcNAc and the other for UDP-GlcA, and the elongation is on the nonreducing end. Animal cells express a set of catabolic enzymes that degrade hyaluronan. The human hyaluronidase gene (HYAL) family is complex, with two sets of three contiguous genes located on two chromosomes, a pattern that suggests two ancient gene duplications followed by a block duplication. In humans, the cluster on chromosome 3p21.3 (HYAL1, 2, and 3) appears to have major roles in somatic tissues.'
 'In the nucleus and cytoplasm, OGT appears to form multimers, consisting of one or more 110-kDa subunits and 78-kDa subunits. Several useful small molecule inhibitors of OGT have been developed, including OSMI-4b, Ac45SGlcNAc, and 5SGlcNHex, with the latter effective in animal models. However, some off-target effects have been reported for these inhibitors, likely because they impact other enzymes that use UDP-GlcNAc. ncOGT has two distinct domains separated by a putative nuclear localization sequence. The amino terminus of each OGT subunit contains TPRs, which can number up to 13 (species-dependent). The major variation between the three (above) variants is in the number of the TPRs.']","The OGA enzyme was purified from rat kidney and bovine brain, and the human gene was cloned using peptide sequence information.

On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors.","['Viruses typically have minimalist genomes and use host-cell machinery for replication. Thus, glycosylation of enveloped viruses reflects that of the host. However, there are exceptions. Giant viruses such as the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough that they can express their own glycosylation machineries. On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors. For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide.'
 'It has long been known that many viruses use host glycans as specific binding receptors for entering the cell (Chapter 37). Similarly, several viruses encode lytic enzymes that break down host cell surface glycans to release viral particles after viral replication. Genome sequencing reveals that many double-stranded DNA viruses also take advantage by adding sugars to host glycoproteins through the use of viral GTs (Chapter 42). Although biological roles of viral GTs are poorly understood, some functions have been identified. For example, the T4 bacteriophage encodes nucleases that degrade host cell DNA. To protect its own genome, the phage modifies its DNA by replacing cytosine with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and subsequently transferring glucose (Glc) to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine using a specific UDP-Glc:DNA Glc-transferase.'
 'The baculovirus enzyme ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase (EGT) disrupts the hormonal balance of the insect host by catalyzing the conjugation of ecdysteroid hormones with Glc or galactose (Gal). Expression of the EGT gene allows the virus to block molting and pupation of infected insect larvae. Similarly, Chloroviruses have enzymes in CAZy family GT4 for the glycosylation of their structural proteins. Serotype conversion in Shigella flexneri is mediated by temperate bacteriophages, which encode GTs that mediate O-antigen conversion by the addition of Glc to O-antigen units. Finally, giant viruses such as Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus encode 12 putative GTs for the synthesis of complex O-glycans. Bacterial GTs play a major role in their symbiosis and virulence.'
 'It has been shown that the archaeon Methanococcus voltae uses this strategy to transfer N-glycans to flagellin and S-layer proteins. Like bacteria and eukaryotes, evolution toward an obligate symbiont lifestyle was also accompanied by gene loss in Archaea. For example, the tiny genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans appears to encode only three GTs and no GH. With their large genomes and complex body plans that require regulated gene expression in different tissues and/or at different developmental stages, genomes of eukaryotes encode many more GTs and GHs than those of individual bacteria and Archaeal species. But, overall, prokaryotes appear to use a greater diversity of the monosaccharides that exist in nature (Chapters 20–23). Several eukaryotes have also undergone genome reduction and lost most of their GT genes. Thus, Plasmodium falciparum and Encephalitozoon cuniculi have only nine and eight GTs, respectively.'
 'Claims regarding “sialic acid–independent” rotaviruses may be explained by internal sialic acids resistant to bacterial sialidases. Many other viruses (e.g., adenovirus, reovirus, Sendai virus, and polyomavirus) also use sialic acids for infection, and crystal structures are now available for several of their sialic acid–binding domains. A number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), foot-and-mouth disease virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and dengue flavivirus, use heparan sulfate proteoglycans as adhesion receptors (Table 37.1). In many cases, the proteoglycans may be part of a coreceptor system in which viruses make initial contact with a cell-surface proteoglycan and later with another receptor. For example, HSV infection is thought to initially involve the binding of viral glycoproteins gB and/or gC to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.'
 'Interestingly, the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans secretes a PNAG hydrolase known as dispersin B (DspB) that has been shown to effectively disperse biofilms formed by PNAG-producing bacteria and is therefore also being developed as an adjuvant to antibiotic therapy. Viruses bind to host cells as a prerequisite for entry and intracellular replication. The enrichment of glycans on cell surfaces make them an attractive target for viral attachment and entry. Virus–glycan interactions are often responsible for species and tissue tropism (Table 37.1), as illustrated here with examples of three human pathogens: influenza virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), showing different modes of glycan-mediated viral interactions (Figure 42.5). Influenza viruses use a sialic acid–recognizing protein (hemagglutinin) for binding and entry (Figure 42.5A).'
 'Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide. In this regard, it has been suggested that the high frequency of heterozygous states for human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 44) may reflect selection for genomes that limit glycosylation of invading viruses. Host lectins may also be “hijacked” by glycans on viral surface glycoproteins. For example, Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1; Chapter 15) is used by the heavily sialylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to gain entry into macrophages. Viral protein sequence can also influence host glycosylation (e.g., by structural constraints on access for glycosyltransferases or hydrolases), in a manner that favors viral antigenicity, such as the high-mannose N-glycans on HIV-1 envelope gp120 trimers.']","For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes.","For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes.

The prototypical hyaluronan and cellulose synthases from Streptococci and Gram-negative bacteria show different architectures, yet both are sufficient for both synthesis and export across the cytoplasmic membrane.

In Gram-negative bacteria, a periplasmic scaffold links the synthase to an outer membrane protein channel. Although the focus of this chapter is on the glycobiology of bacterial cell envelopes, there are several additional (and equally important) facets of bacterial glycobiology.

For example, glycogen and trehalose act as storage compounds within some bacteria.'
 'In Gram-positive bacteria, substantially thicker layers of peptidoglycan surround a single membrane and provide an attachment point for other glycan structures. Another class of bacteria, the Negativicutes, are related to the Gram-positive Firmicutes but nevertheless have a two-membrane architecture and stain as Gram-negative. Other bacteria produce variable responses in the Gram-staining reaction, largely because of the presence of other glycans and cell wall lipids (see below).

 'Reflecting these many functions, surface glycoconjugates are remarkably diverse, enabled by the propensity for bacterial genetic recombination and lateral gene transfer and shaped by environmental interactions that impart niche-specific selective pressures. Surface glycoconjugates drive a variety of important interactions with host innate and adaptive immune defenses. Some are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), for example, via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways. Others are natural targets of adaptive immunity and have been exploited in successful vaccine strategies. Because of their importance in cell viability, surface glycoconjugates are also frequent targets of antimicrobial strategies. This chapter will provide an overview of the structure and biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, together with some examples of their functions. Bacteria were historically divided into two major groups based on their response in the Gram-staining procedure (i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms), reflecting the organization of the cell wall.'
 'Bacteria were historically divided into two major groups based on their response in the Gram-staining procedure (i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms), reflecting the organization of the cell wall. The amount and location of peptidoglycan in the cell wall is an important contributor to the outcome of Gram staining. Peptidoglycan is essential for the viability of most bacteria. It consists of polysaccharide strands covalently cross-linked by short peptides, creating a three-dimensional structure that confers shape and rigidity to the cell. In Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the cell wall consists of two membranes separated by a cellular compartment termed the periplasm in which thin layers of peptidoglycan reside (Figure 21.1). In Gram-positive bacteria, substantially thicker layers of peptidoglycan surround a single membrane and provide an attachment point for other glycan structures.'
 'The outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with an outer leaflet composed mainly of a unique glycolipid called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is essential for the integrity of the permeability barrier imposed by the outer membrane. Many Gram-negative bacteria are covered in a surface-bound polysaccharide layer known as a capsule, and, in some cases, this capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is released from the cell in large amounts as free exopolysaccharide (EPS). Bacteria producing these products are often readily identified by their highly mucoid colonies. Structural variations in the LPS and capsules of different bacterial species are diverse and influence many types of interactions between bacteria and their environmental and host niches. Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane (Figure 21.1) and depend on a much thicker multilayered peptidoglycan layer for viability.'
 'Their complex cell walls have a high content of remarkable glycan and glycolipid structures (Figure 21.1). The unique arabinogalactan (AG) component that characterizes these organisms is covalently attached to peptidoglycan and provides an attachment point for characteristic long-chain (C60–C90) α-alkyl-β-hydroxymycolic acids. The resulting mycolyl-AG-peptidoglycan complex underpins a permeability barrier conferring resistance to antibiotics and other harmful molecules. Mycolic acids help form an envelope layer referred to as an “outer membrane,” although its structure shares no similarity with its namesake in Gram-negative bacteria. Peptidoglycan (also known as murein) forms a rigid sacculus enveloping the cytoplasmic membrane, conferring cell shape, and contributing to the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of internal osmotic (turgor) pressure.'

Glycoconjugates are integral components of the cell surfaces of bacteria and are often the immediate point of contact with the environment.

Second, bacteria produce a wide range of glycan-binding proteins. These include adhesins that facilitate bacterial colonization, exotoxins that bind to host membrane glycans, and single-sugar-binding proteins involved in metabolism (see Chapter 42). Third, bacterial lifestyles are often defined by their capacity to digest and/or metabolize glycans. Complex nanomachines have been described for the degradation of complex carbohydrate structures.

Since Neuberger's discovery of protein glycosylation in the late 1930s (Chapter 1) and his description of the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-β-asparagine linkage of a glycan to the modified protein, it became generally accepted that protein glycosylation was a process limited to eukaryotes. This long-held belief was challenged in 1976, when Mescher and Strominger showed that the surface (S)-layer glycoprotein of the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was subject to both N- and O-glycosylation, thus offering the first example of a noneukaryotic glycoprotein.""

It causes serious invasive disease in immunocompromised people that is difficult to treat, leading to high mortality rates. As with other fungal pathogens, the surface glycans of A. fumigatus are critical for interactions with the host. The cell wall of infectious forms of this fungus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors. The hyphal wall has a core of branched β1-3-glucan covalently linked to other glucan components, chitin, and galactomannan, which consists of a mannose backbone with short galactofuranose side chains. Interestingly, galactomannan also occurs anchored to the plasma membrane by a GPI. This polysaccharide is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and is probably transferred to the cell wall by transglycosidases, in the same way as GPI-anchored proteins.'

These are C-type lectins expressed by immune cells that are important in both innate and adaptive immune responses (see Chapter 34). PLM antigens may be shed by C. albicans and, through interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLR-2), they can induce nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and cytokine responses such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. Galectin-3, a ubiquitous member of the galectin family of lectins that is highly expressed in macrophages, also appears to recognize C. albicans expressing β1-2-linked mannose residues, resulting in opsonization of the yeast. A. fumigatus is an environmental mold that spreads by airborne particles.'
 'C. neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental basidiomycete yeast that causes severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, leading to roughly half a million deaths per year worldwide. It is unique among pathogenic fungi in having an extensive polysaccharide capsule that is required for virulence (Figure 23.6). The capsule is a dynamic structure that changes in thickness and composition depending on the environment and growth conditions. It is particularly large in the context of mammalian infection, in which it impedes host immune responses. It is composed of two large (millions of Da) polysaccharides named for their monosaccharide components: glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal).'
 'For example, during plant infections plant glycosylhydrolases may partially digest wall glucans of invading fungi. Some of the released oligosaccharides, termed oligosaccharins, can then act as signals to promote plant antifungal defenses. C. albicans (an ascomycete) is a normal commensal organism that can cause illness ranging from irritations of mucosal surfaces to life-threatening systemic infections. The C. albicans cell wall contains β1-3- and β1-6-linked glucans and chitin, similar to the S. cerevisiae wall, and immunogenic mannans that are termed phosphopeptidomannans. It also produces unusual short β1-2-linked mannose chains (Figure 23.2) that are highly antigenic and are also expressed on phospholipomannan (PLM) antigens. PLM antigens contain phytoceramide derivatives of myo-inositol phosphate.'

 'Coprinopsis cinerea is a mushroom species that has gained prominence as a model for studies of diverse topics including mating, sexual development, meiosis, and the evolution of multicellularity. Its N-glycans typically are high mannose type with five to nine mannoses, but may also have a bisecting α1-4GlcNAc at the β-mannose. Pathogenic fungi are a significant cause of plant and animal disease, responsible for devastation of crops, decimation of animal populations (e.g., certain bat, amphibian, and bee species), and serious human diseases that kill an estimated one million people each year. These organisms display diverse glycans, which typically differ from those of the host and have been implicated in multiple pathogenic processes and host–pathogen interactions. For example, during plant infections plant glycosylhydrolases may partially digest wall glucans of invading fungi.']","The cell wall of infectious forms of A. fumigatus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors. The hyphal wall has a core of branched β1-3-glucan covalently linked to other glucan components, chitin, and galactomannan, which consists of a mannose backbone with short galactofuranose side chains. Interestingly, galactomannan also occurs anchored to the plasma membrane by a GPI. This polysaccharide is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and is probably transferred to the cell wall by transglycosidases, in the same way as GPI-anchored proteins.","As with other fungal pathogens, the surface glycans of A. fumigatus are critical for interactions with the host.

Apiogalacturonans have only been identified in the walls of duckweeds and seagrasses. The substituted galacturonan referred to as RG-II, which accounts for between 2% and 5% of the primary cell wall, is the most structurally complex polysaccharide yet identified in nature. It is composed of 12 different monosaccharides linked together by up to 21 distinct glycosidic linkages (Figure 24.2). Four structurally different side chains and one or two Araf substituents are attached to the galacturonan backbone.'
 'Such interactions alter the mechanical properties of the wall and may influence plant growth and development. Rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) is a family of polysaccharides with a backbone composed of a repeating disaccharide 4-α-D-GalpA-1-2-α-L-Rhap-1. Many of the GalpAs are acetylated at O-2 and/or O-3. Depending on the plant, between 20% and 80% of the Rhap residues may be substituted at O-4 with linear or branched side chains composed predominantly of Araf and Galp, together with smaller amounts of Fucp and GlcpA (Figure 24.2). Little is known about the functions of these side chains and their contribution to the properties of the primary wall. Substituted galacturonans have a backbone composed of 1-4-linked α-D-GalpA acid residues that are substituted to varying degrees with mono-, di-, or oligosaccharides.'
 'Four structurally different side chains and one or two Araf substituents are attached to the galacturonan backbone. Two structurally conserved disaccharides (side chains C and D) are linked to O-3 of the backbone. The A and B side chains, which contain between 7 and 9 monosaccharides, are linked to O-2 of the backbone. Several of the monosaccharides in RG-II are O-methylated and/or O-acetylated. Virtually all of the RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer cross-linked by a borate ester. The ester is formed between the Apif residue in side chain A of each RG-II monomer (Figure 24.2). The dimer forms rapidly in vitro when the RG-II monomer is reacted with boric acid and a divalent cation. However, the mechanism and site of dimer formation in planta has not been determined.'
 'The presence of 1-2-linked Rhap residues does not introduce kinks into the backbone geometry of rhamnogalacturonan and thereby limit interchain associations. Rather, it is the side chains linked to these residues that are responsible for preventing or limiting interchain associations. The conformations of the four side chains attached to the homogalacturonan backbone may lead RG-II to adopt a “disk-like” shape. Well-defined tertiary structures are predicted for the RG-II monomer and the dimer. In the dimer, borate-ester cross-linking and Ca++ interchain pairing further stabilizes the two disks. The apparent resistance of RG-II to wall-modifying enzymes together with the formation of a cation-stabilized RG-II dimer likely results in a structure that resists temporal changes in the plant. In contrast, homogalacturonan is continually modified by the action of wall enzymes and its contribution to wall architecture is therefore time dependent.'
 'However, recent studies have shown that bacteria present in the human gut produce glycanases capable of hydrolyzing all but one of the glycosidic bonds in RG-II. Pectin is believed to exist in the cell wall as a macromolecular complex comprised of structural domains—homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan, and substituted galacturonan—that are covalently and noncovalently linked to one another. However, there is only a limited understanding of how these structural domains are organized (Figure 24.2). Molecular modeling of a pectin (∼50 kDa) containing homogalacturonan (degree of polymerization ∼100) and rhamnogalacturonan with arabinogalactan side chains, together with modeling of RG-II conformation have begun to provide insights into the conformations and relative dimensions of each pectin structural domain.'
 'However, the mechanism and site of dimer formation in planta has not been determined. Borate cross-linking of RG-II is likely to have substantial effects on the properties of pectin and the primary wall as RG-II is itself linked to homogalacturonan (Figure 24.2). Indeed, mutations that affect RG-II structure and cross-linking result in plants with abnormal walls and severe growth defects. Swollen primary walls and abnormal growth together with reduced RG-II cross-linking are also a characteristic of boron deficient plants. RG-II was believed to be largely resistant to fragmentation by microbial enzymes. However, recent studies have shown that bacteria present in the human gut produce glycanases capable of hydrolyzing all but one of the glycosidic bonds in RG-II.'

These include “mucin-type” O-glycans, many of which are based on the core 1 O-glycan structure common to vertebrates (Chapter 10), but which can be extended by β-glucose, glucuronic acid, and α1-2 fucose residues (Figure 25.4).

 'Heparan and chondroitin sulfate are found in many animal taxa, including insects (Chapter 26) and in mollusks. The most widely distributed and evolutionarily ancient class appears to be chondroitin chains, which are not always sulfated (e.g., in C. elegans) (Chapter 25). The more highly sulfated and epimerized forms of heparin and dermatan sulfate tend to be found primarily in more recently evolved animal species of the deuterostome lineage. The same is true of hyaluronan, a secreted free glycosaminoglycan synthesized at the cell membrane and likely evolved from its precursor chitin to facilitate the movement of metazoan cells and shaping of organs during development and normal physiology. Echinoderms such as the sea cucumber make typical chondroitin chains, but some glucuronic acids have branches containing fucose sulfate.'
 'Chst1 and 5 can add sulfate groups at the indicated positions. The actual order of the various sulfated and nonsulfated (more...) Two classes of glycosaminoglycan chains—chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate/heparin—are linked to serine residues in proteins by way of xylose (Figure 17.4). Xylosyltransferase initiates the process using UDP-xylose as donor. Two isoforms of the enzyme are known in vertebrates (XYLT1 and XYLT2), but only one isozyme exists in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. A glycine residue invariably lies to the carboxy-terminal side of the serine attachment site, but a perfect consensus sequence for xylosylation does not exist. At least two acidic amino acid residues are usually present, and they can be located on one or both sides of the serine, usually within a few residues.'
 'Heparan (more...) Additional enzymes exist for epimerization of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid in dermatan sulfate (DSE1-2), sulfation at the C-2 position of the uronic acids, and other patterns of sulfation found in unusual species of chondroitin (Table 17.2). The location of sulfate groups is easily assessed using bacterial chondroitinases (ABC, B, and ACII) that cleave the chains into disaccharides. Many chains are hybrid structures containing more than one type of chondroitin disaccharide unit. For example, dermatan sulfate is defined as having one or more iduronic acid–containing disaccharide units (chondroitin sulfate B) as well as glucuronic acid–containing disaccharides (chondroitin sulfate A and C). Animal cells also degrade chondroitin sulfate in lysosomes using a series of exolytic activities (Chapter 44).'
 'Echinoderms such as the sea cucumber make typical chondroitin chains, but some glucuronic acids have branches containing fucose sulfate. Simpler multicellular animals such as sponges can have unusual glycosaminoglycans that include uronic acids but do not have the typical repeat units of chondroitin and heparan sulfate. Plants do not have typical animal glycosaminoglycans. Instead, they have secreted acidic pectin polysaccharides not attached to protein cores (only hyaluronan is unattached among animal glycosaminoglycans), characterized by galacturonic acid and its methyl ester derivative (Chapter 24). Bacteria have mostly completely distinct polysaccharides (Chapter 21), although certain pathogenic strains can mimic mammalian glycosaminoglycan chains (see below).'
 'The structural features in control of keratan sulfate substitution remain unclear, as the underlying poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone can be found on many other glycoproteins. Notably, in humans and bovine, the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan found in cartilage (aggrecan) contains a segment of four to 23 hexapeptide repeats (E-E/L-P-F-P-S) where the keratan sulfate chains are located, whereas aggrecan in rats and other rodents lacks this motif and does not contain keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfates (KS) contain a sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain, linked to either asparagine or serine/threonine residues. Chst1 and 5 can add sulfate groups at the indicated positions.'
 'The function of galactose sulfation in chondroitin sulfate remains unclear. The linkage tetrasaccharide lies at a bifurcation in the biosynthetic pathway: addition of β4-linked N-acetylgalactosamine, which initiates chondroitin sulfate assembly, or addition of α4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, which initiates heparan sulfate assembly (Figure 17.4). Genetic evidence from studies of C. elegans suggests that N-acetylgalactosamine addition during chondroitin assembly is mediated by the same enzyme that is involved in chain polymerization (Sqv5), but biochemical evidence suggests that more than one enzyme may exist in vertebrates. In heparin/heparan sulfate formation, the addition of the first N-acetylglucosamine residue is catalyzed by an enzyme called EXTL3, which differs from the transferases involved in heparan polymerization (called EXT1 and EXT2).']","Chondroitin and heparan sulfate have been detected in C. elegans, but keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronan have not been found.

 'Arthropods are among the most successful species on Earth and are found in all types of environments. One of their characteristic features is an exoskeleton composed of chitin, which provides support and physical protection. The best-studied example is the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. In 1910, T.H. Morgan published the first paper about the genetics of D. melanogaster, which showed that white eye color was a sex-linked trait.

New analytical techniques have expanded the appreciation for the glycan synthetic capacity of the organism and have helped establish links between interesting phenotypes and altered glycan expression.'
 'Moreover, improved analytic techniques allowed the detection of very minor glycans. The commercial and experimental demand for eukaryotic expression systems led to the characterization of the glycosylation pathways of cells derived from the moth Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9 cells) and from D. melanogaster (S2 cells). It is now clear that high-mannose and paucimannose glycans account for >90% of the total N-linked glycan diversity in Drosophila and other insects throughout their life cycles.

 'Anti-HRP antibodies show that the Fucα1-3GlcNAc epitope is restricted primarily to neural tissue in a broad range of arthropods. Drosophila does not extend its core fucose residues with additional capping monosaccharides nor modify its N-linked glycans by O-methylation, both of which occur extensively in Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25). The demonstration of fucosylated, sialylated, sulfated, hybrid, biantennary complex, and triantennary complex glycans in all stages of the D. melanogaster life cycle makes the diversity of the arthropod N-glycans generally comparable to that of mammals (Chapter 27), except for the very limited use of sialic acids (Sias). The relative paucity of complex N-linked glycans in Drosophila has been attributed at least partially to the presence of a hexosaminidase in the secretory pathway.'

 'Chitin is a major component of the rigid, cuticular exoskeleton of all Arthropoda, and therefore these animals expend considerable resources toward its assembly. Chitin fibrils also form a more subtle, protective layer at the apical surface of gut epithelial cells (the peritrophic membrane) and in the lumen of the forming tracheal system. Elegant genetic screens have shown that mutations in genes necessary for chitin polymerization, modification, and disassembly affect tracheal morphology (Table 26.1). The potential for chitin or for small chitin-based oligosaccharides to modulate cell signaling and morphogenesis remains unexplored in Drosophila. Insects were once classified as “animals without gangliosides” in reference to sialylated glycosphingolipids (GSLs) found broadly distributed in animal families other than the arthropods (Chapter 11). However, arthropods possess their own family of GSLs, designated as the arthroseries.']","The chapter provides insights into glycosylation in Arthropoda, particularly focusing on Drosophila melanogaster.

In fact, much of what we know about the biochemistry of fertilization was first discovered in this organism (Figure 27.1), and the information subsequently applied to mammalian sperm–egg interactions. One of the advantages of studying fertilization in sea urchins is that eggs and sperm are easy to obtain in large quantities.

About 80% of the weight of egg jelly is a high-molecular-weight linear fucose (Fuc) sulfate polymer (FSP) with a molecular mass of >106 Da. Receptor proteins on sperm bind to FSP, triggering the opening of two pharmacologically distinct calcium channels that induce the exocytosis of the sperm's acrosome vesicle (the “acrosome reaction”). The ionic mechanisms that trigger the acrosome reaction are conserved in mammals, but the nature of the sperm surface receptors varies. FSP is a species-selective inducer of the sea urchin sperm acrosomal reaction and most FSPs are sulfated α1-3Fuc-based linear polymers made of tri- or tetrasaccharide repeats.""
 'Before fertilization, individual sperm undergo capacitation enabling them to penetrate and fertilize an ovum. During this process, SPAM1, a GPI-anchored hyaluronidase, redistributes and accumulates in the sperm head. SPAM1 binds hyaluronan in the cumulus, causing an increase in Ca++ flux and sperm motility. It also helps dissolve the cumulus matrix as the sperm moves through the hyaluronan vestment. A soluble form of SPAM1 is secreted during the acrosome reaction. The release of acrosomal hyaluronidase and proteases renders the sperm capable of fusing with the egg and eventually destroys the entire matrix to allow the fertilized oocyte to implant and develop. There are several hyaluronan-binding proteins with homologous link modules (Figure 16.3).'
 'Hint-2, in contrast, is only expressed in Paneth cells that function in immune surveillance in the crypts of the small intestine. Glycan microarray results show that both Hints bind to the glycans of a unique set of human pathogenic bacteria that have in common the presence of particular cis-diols on their outer surface polysaccharides and include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Crystal structures of Hint-1 and the Xenopus embryonic epidermal lectin show a conserved mechanism of glycan recognition. But clearly, the carbohydrate binding determinants for each intelectin studied are unique. It is becoming clear that the X-lectin family plays key roles in deuterostome innate immune responses against pathogens. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) provides an excellent model organism for understanding the functions of genes in early vertebrate development (Figure 27.3). Females lay several hundred eggs weekly, which undergo external fertilization.'
 'The availability of GPI-deficient mammalian cell lines shows that GPI-APs are not essential at the cellular level. However, mouse knockouts and tissue-specific conditional knockouts of the PIGA gene clearly show that GPI-APs are essential for early embryo and tissue development. GPI anchors impart to their attached proteins the ability to be shed from the cell surface in soluble form through the action of cellular or serum GPI-cleaving enzymes. Mammalian sperms acquire the ability to fuse with oocytes after GPI-anchored TEX101 and LY6K are released by a sperm-associated GPI-cleaving enzyme tACE (testis form angiotensin converting enzyme). The cleavage of GPI-APs is required for maturation of ADAM3, a metalloprotease on the sperm surface. Certain proliferating motor neurons initiate differentiation after the GPI-anchored proteinase inhibitor, RECK, is released by the GPI-cleaving enzyme, GDE2.']","Bindin, released from the acrosomal vesicle during the sea urchin sperm acrosome reaction, plays a crucial role in binding the sperm to the egg surface glycoprotein EBR1. Additionally, bindin exhibits agglutination properties similar to plant lectins and can be blocked by glycopeptide fragments from unfertilized eggs.","Bindin is thought to recognize glycans on EBR1. EBR1 itself has lectin-like domains, but its glycan ligands are unknown. Most studies of glycosylation in sea urchins have identified glycosyltransferase activities and the glycans they synthesize (e.g., including N-glycans with antennal β1-3-linked Gal, β1-4GalNAc, Neu5Gc, and sulphate residues as well as traces of the “invertebrate” feature of core α1-3/α1-6-difucosylation) (Figure 27.2). The functions of glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) can be investigated using genetic strategies in sea urchins, antisense morpholinos or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down gene expression have been the methods of choice, but these will likely be superseded by more precise gene editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) strategy or transcription activator–like effector (TALE) nucleases (TALENs).",1.0,0.7344257848254484,0.6391825797854793,0.0425531914893617,0.999999999975,0.75
"Complete the following paragraph: A wide variety of methods for coupling monosaccharides and complex glycans to create affinity resins have been developed. As mentioned above, many sulfated-GAG-binding proteins have been discovered by affinity chromatography using immobilized GAG chains.","['The ability to bind specific glycans, assessed in various biochemical assays, has often been the basis for direct identification of novel GBPs without reference to a particular biological function. For example, most galectins (Chapter 36) share a binding preference for β-galactosides and F-type lectins for fucosyl residues. In addition to forming a basis for binding and competition assays, the binding activity is commonly used as a means of isolating these proteins by using affinity chromatography with appropriate immobilized glycan ligands. A wide variety of methods for coupling monosaccharides and complex glycans to create affinity resins have been developed. As mentioned above, many sulfated-GAG-binding proteins have been discovered by affinity chromatography using immobilized GAG chains. A limitation of these approaches is that binding activity does not directly indicate a biological function and the roles of many well-characterized GBPs have not been fully determined.'
 'A main technical challenge to understand GAG–protein interactions is to dissect the essential structural elements of GAGs that contribute to the binding. Unlike researchers studying DNA-binding proteins who have access to all possible DNA sequences, researchers studying GAG-binding proteins traditionally do not have access to GAG oligosaccharides with defined structures. Fortunately, this situation has begun to change in the last 5 years. With the rapid progress of chemoenzymatic and chemical synthesis (or a combination of both) of HS/CS oligosaccharides, a growing number of structural defined oligosaccharides (dp4-dp20) have become available. Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins.'
 'These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants. ConA-Sepharose is commonly used to isolate glycoproteins as it shows little binding to nonglycosylated proteins. However, it does not bind all glycoproteins because it recognizes specific N-glycan structures. ConA-Sepharose has also been used to isolate free oligo- and polymannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary N-glycans. When combined in a serial format, multiple lectins can be used in affinity chromatography to isolate glycoconjugates containing most of the major glycan structures present in animal cells, with glycoconjugates being separated as classes that share common determinants. An example of serial lectin affinity chromatography is shown in Figure 48.8. Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications.'
 'For example, the agglutinin from Sambucus nigra (SNA) binds to glycans that terminate with α2-6 sialic acid (Sia). Lectins (Chapters 31–36) recognizing terminal fucose (Fuc), galactose (Gal), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) are also commercially available. Metabolic labeling of glycoconjugates with radioactive sugars is another powerful tool for determining the composition of glycans. Cells incubated in media containing 3H- or 14C-labeled monosaccharides will incorporate the label into the glycans of glycoconjugates. Radiolabeled glycans can be detected following gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) by autoradiography or fluorography. They can also be released and studied in detail by various methods.'
 'Combinations of affinity chromatography and other chromatographic techniques can be very useful in identifying and separating glycopeptides. Thus, the ability of glycans to be recognized by lectins dependent on specific structural features in the glycans is a powerful tool for glycan identification and isolation. In some approaches, the glycans are tagged at the reducing end by fluorophores and radioisotopes or may be obtained by metabolic radiolabeling from cells or tissues grown in the presence of radiolabeled sugar precursors, such as [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans.'
 'Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions. The binding proteins in turn fall into two broad groups: lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins (Chapters 27, 28, and 38). Such molecules can be either intrinsic to the organism that synthesized the cognate glycans (e.g., see Chapters 31–36, 38, and 39) or extrinsic (see Chapters 37 and 42 for information concerning microbial proteins that bind to specific glycans on host cells). The atomic details of these glycan–protein interactions have been elucidated in many instances (Chapters 29 and 30). Although there are exceptions to this notion, the following general theme has emerged regarding lectins: monovalent binding tends to be of relatively low affinity, and such systems typically achieve their specificity and function by achieving high avidity, via interactions of multivalent arrays of glycans with cognate lectin-binding sites.'
 'Important added value of AGA is the ability to rapidly generate libraries of related but distinct glycans, and the ability to prepare polysaccharides of a size not easily accessible with other methods. The synthesis of a 100-mer polymannoside commences with placing a polystyrene Merrifield resin equipped with a photo-cleavable linker 11 in the reaction vessel of an automated synthesizer. Mannose thioglycoside building block 12 is employed for AGA using a four-step cycle (Figure 53.4A). The incorporation of each monomer relies on an acidic washing step to prevent quenching by any remaining base, followed by the coupling step using 5-6.5 equivalents of building block 12. Next, a capping step prevents any unreacted nucleophiles from engaging in subsequent couplings to produce (n-1)-polysaccharides that are difficult to separate from the desired product.']",These methods include using immobilized GAG chains in affinity chromatography to isolate sulfated-GAG-binding proteins.,A limitation of these approaches is that binding activity does not directly indicate a biological function and the roles of many well-characterized GBPs have not been fully determined. The observation that many lectins fall into structurally distinct families provides an alternative way to identify novel GBPs through analysis of protein sequences. Sequence motifs characteristic of CRDs are routinely used to screen sequences from whole genome sequencing. These motifs can also be used to screen specific cDNA and gene sequences of interest because of their association with biological functions.,1.0,0.7520626468885682,0.478150414754959,0.05128205128205128,0.9999999999857143,0.25

In this approach a solution containing potential ligands is incubated with a GBP that may be immobilized on a surface (e.g., a bead). Afterward the bead-GBP is subjected to several steps (e.g., magnetic separation or centrifugation) to remove the unbound material.","['There are some limitations to this approach, including (1) only the Kd can be derived, not kon or koff; (2) the conjugation of the GBP to the matrix must be stable and the protein must retain reasonable activity for many different column runs; (3) the amount of GBP conjugated and active must be defined; (4) many different column runs must be made with a single glycan; and (5) if the Kd is high (>1 mm), this approach is typically not feasible. Overall, frontal affinity chromatography is quite useful and is automated. Another variation is generally termed a “pull-down assay,” akin to a type of immunoprecipitation. In this approach a solution containing potential ligands is incubated with a GBP that may be immobilized on a surface (e.g., a bead). Afterward the bead-GBP is subjected to several steps (e.g., magnetic separation or centrifugation) to remove the unbound material.'
 'The sample was treated with sufficient ammonium sulfate to precipitate the complex but not the unbound ligand. The precipitated complex was captured on a filter and the amount of ligand in the complex was determined by γ-counting. In this approach, a glycoprotein (or ligand) is mixed with a GBP or antibody and the mixture is electrophoretically separated in polyacrylamide. For glycosaminoglycans, this technique is termed affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE). This method is particularly useful in defining the apparent Kd of the interaction and allows identification of subpopulations of glycosaminoglycans that differentially interact with the GBP. In another method, termed crossed affinity immunoelectrophoresis, a second step of electrophoresis is conducted in the second perpendicular dimension across an agarose gel that contains precipitating monospecific antibody to the glycoprotein or ligand.'
 'Thus, a multiplexed approach is taken where a GBP is mixed with a set of conjugated beads each identifiable by its fluorescent properties. The GBP may be biotinylated, allowing detection by fluorescent streptavidin, or the GBP may be detected by binding to specific antibody or another reagent if the GBP is epitope-tagged. The degree of binding of the GBP is a measure of its affinity and specificity for a particular glycan. The advantages of this approach is that it is high-throughput, allowing thousands of assays to be performed automatically, as well as utilizing small amounts of both glycan and GBP. The collection of data and its analysis are also automated. A limitation of the approach is that each glycan to be derivatized must be activated by having a primary amine or other chemistry for conjugation, and each conjugation of a glycan needs to be independently validated. Multivalent GBPs interacting with multivalent ligands, as expressed on cells, can cause the cells to agglutinate.'

A variety of chemistries are available for coupling ligand or receptor to the surface of the chip, including reaction with amines, thiols, or aldehydes and noncovalent biotin capture. In some approaches, a glycoprotein ligand for a GBP is immobilized and binding of the GBP is measured directly. It is also possible to degrade the immobilized glycoprotein ligand on the chip sequentially by passing over solutions containing exoglycosidases and reexamining at each step the binding to different GBPs, thereby obtaining structural information about the ligand. The immobilized ligand is usually quite stable and can be used repeatedly for hundreds of runs during a period of months.'
 'Afterward the bead-GBP is subjected to several steps (e.g., magnetic separation or centrifugation) to remove the unbound material. The material bound to the bead-GBP may then be eluted for measurement and further analyses. Using this pull-down setup, one can perform a concentration-dependent binding assay to obtain an apparent Ka of the ligand for the immobilized GBP. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is one of the most rigorous means of defining the equilibrium binding constant between a glycan and a GBP or indeed any protein and its ligand. The binding of a glycan to the GBP is measured as a change in enthalpy using a commercial microcalorimeter. In this technique, a solution containing a glycan of interest is added in increments into a solution containing a fixed concentration of GBP. The glycan is added at many intervals and the heat evolved from binding is measured relative to a reference cell.'
 'The amount of protein or ligand in the precipitate can be measured directly by chemical means, using assays for glycans or proteins. The technique of precipitation is useful for studying potentially multivalent ligands, and it has been used recently to show that each branch of terminally galactosylated complex-type di-, tri-, and tetra-antennary N-glycans is independently recognized by galactose-binding lectins. Another precipitation approach takes advantage of the fact that a complex between a GBP and a glycan can be “salted out” or precipitated by ammonium sulfate. A variation of this approach was used in early studies on the characterization of the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR), in which the ligand 125I-labeled asialoorosomucoid was incubated with a preparation of receptor. The sample was treated with sufficient ammonium sulfate to precipitate the complex but not the unbound ligand.'
 'In a typical successful analysis a GBP may bind to several glycans that share structural features, often termed glycan-binding determinants or motifs. If desired, the GBP can then be tested for its binding to the identified candidates by other methods such as titration microcalorimetry or fluorescence polarization, to define the Kd as discussed above. The use of microarrays in characterizing GBPs is a central component of functional glycomics (Chapter 51). Publicly available glycan microarray binding data repositories are increasingly used in the field. A variation of glycan microarrays is a bead-based Luminex-type assay. In this high-throughput approach glycans are covalently immobilized on Luminex beads of different fluorophore properties. Thus, a multiplexed approach is taken where a GBP is mixed with a set of conjugated beads each identifiable by its fluorescent properties.']","The material bound to the bead-GBP may then be eluted for measurement and further analyses.

Structural biology is an evolving area of science both in terms of methodology and questions to be answered. The principle methodologies discussed here are each evolving: crystallographic methods using new X-ray sources (e.g., X-ray lasers) are allowing the analysis of microcrystals at room temperature and femtosecond timescales, thereby eliminating temperature- and beam-induced artifacts. Cryo-EM single-particle methods are approaching resolutions previously confined to X-ray crystallography. Single-particle and tomography EM approaches are continuing to undergo rapid development in terms of EM infrastructure, sample preparation, and data acquisition. Several user-friendly pipeline data processing packages exist, making this technology attractive to an increasing scientific audience. Hyperpolarization methods are reducing the sensitivity limitations of NMR, and solid-state NMR methods are allowing application to amorphous materials, including fibrils, cell-wall structures, and membrane fragments.'
 'Structural information on bound glycan ligands that is complementary to that from X-ray crystallography is increasingly coming from NMR methods. This is particularly valuable in that it is applicable to ligands with a broader range of affinities, including many that have the lower affinities amplified in multivalent interactions. It is also applicable in solution under near-physiological conditions in which concerns about the effects of crystal lattice contacts and occlusion of some interaction sites are absent. It is even possible to conduct some experiments on assemblies that mimic a membrane surface environment, an environment in which many protein–glycan interactions occur.

 'Recent advances in cryo-EM provide many exciting opportunities to study protein–glycan interactions, which will also be discussed. The fundamental understanding of glycan–protein interactions, as enriched by experimental studies of all types, has now been encoded in powerful molecular simulation programs that provide a computational approach to generating three dimensional pictures of glycan–protein complexes. These are important because it is difficult to produce complex glycan ligands in the amounts and purity required for most experimental approaches. These methods, although still evolving toward increased confidence in outcomes, provide models for experimentally inaccessible systems that can be tested with a variety of nonstructural approaches. They can also be leveraged with sparse structural data that alone could not provide detailed structural information. X-ray crystallography is a very powerful method for obtaining details of protein–ligand interactions. It excels in terms of the size range of molecules that can be studied (from small compounds to large multiprotein complexes) and in efficiency of data collection when high-energy X-ray beams at synchrotron sources are used.'
 'With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions.'
 'The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization.'

Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures.

Different groups within the superfamily are characterized by the domain structures shown.  Ricinus communis is native to Africa and India and has been used for millennia, by many cultural groups, for numerous medical and industrial purposes. Two lectins, originally termed RCA-I and RCA-II, can be purified from the seeds. RCA-I (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) is a hemagglutinin and a very weak toxin. RCA-II (∼60 kDa), better known as ricin, is an agglutinin and a very potent toxin. Ricin is easily extractable from castor beans and can kill humans at very small doses.'
 'Ricin is easily extractable from castor beans and can kill humans at very small doses. RCA-II (ricin; Figure 31.2) is synthesized as a single prepropolypeptide of 576 amino acid (aa) residues containing a secretion signal peptide (residues 1–35), an A chain (residues 36–302), a 12-aa linker region (residues 303–314), and a B chain (residues 315–576). The A-chain toxin is an N-glycoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.22) that inactivates the 60S ribosome. The B-chain lectin domain binds to galactose (Gal) and β-galactosides. The amino-terminal signal sequence brings the propolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal is cleaved off, and the polypeptide is glycosylated.'
 'Through evolution, the R-type lectin domain has given rise to various protein forms, some containing this domain alone and others containing additional functional domains (e.g., enzyme or toxin). We will discuss the diversity of this superfamily in terms of molecular tinkering and “bricolage,” based on structure–function relationships. In 1888, Peter Hermann Stillmark at the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu, Estonia) reported that protein extracts from seeds of Ricinus communis (commonly called “castor oil plant”; seeds are called “castor beans”) contained a factor (which he termed “ricin”) capable of agglutinating erythrocytes. Ricin was already well known as a toxin, but its carbohydrate-binding specificity was not analyzed in detail until the mid-20th century, when it was classified as a lectin.'
 'Each heterodimer contains an A chain disulfide-linked to a Gal-binding B chain. The A-chain sequences of RCA-I and RCA-II differ in 18 residues and are 93% similar, whereas the B-chain sequences differ in 41 of 262 residues and are 84% similar. The subunits are all N-glycosylated and usually display oligomannose-type N-glycans. Several other lectins having high homology with ricin are also encoded by the R. communis genome; some of these are termed ricin-A, -B, -C, -D (ricin), and -E. The B chain of both RCA-I (agglutinin) and RCA-II (ricin) contains two CRDs in the polypeptide. RCA-I binds preferentially to terminal β-linked Gal, whereas RCA-II binds to either terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc.'
 'A wide variety of R-type lectins with diverse configurations, including RIP-IIs and heterotetramers such as RCA-II, have been purified from various plant tissues. Nontoxic lectins isolated from elderberry (genus Sambucus) bark include SSA (Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin) and SNA (Sambucus nigra agglutinin UniProt Q41358). These are useful because it is the rare R-type lectin that binds strongly to α2-6-linked sialic acid–modified glycans, but not to α2-3-linked sialylated ligands. Both are heterotetramers (∼140 kDa) composed of two heterodimers, each containing an A chain (resembling ricin A chain) disulfide-bonded to a B chain (R-type lectin).'
 'RCA-I binds preferentially to terminal β-linked Gal, whereas RCA-II binds to either terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc. These lectins are often purified and separated by differential elution from Gal-based affinity resins; RCA-II is eluted with GalNAc, and RCA-I is then eluted with Gal. These lectins have very low binding affinities for monosaccharides (Kd in the range 10−3 to 10−4 m), but very high affinities (10−7 to 10−8 m) for cells, because of their multivalency and enhanced binding to multiple surface glycans having nonreducing terminal Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (type-2 LacNAc) sequences. Both lectins also bind strongly to glycans with GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-R (LacdiNAc), and weakly to the isomer Galβ1-3GlcNAc-R (type-1 LacNAc).'
 'Neither lectin binds appreciably to glycoconjugates having nonreducing terminal α-linked Gal residues. Ricin is highly toxic and the effects of ingestion are severe, with symptoms appearing after a 2- to 24-h latent period. The lethal dose (LD50) of ricin is extremely low (3–5 µg/kg body weight). Ricin is classified as a type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP-II). RCA-I (agglutinin) is less toxic than ricin, because of the weaker enzymatic activity of its A-chain. Type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP-I), which lack a B chain with R-type lectin domains, are much less toxic than ricin because toxin entry into target cells is facilitated by B-chain carbohydrate-binding activity. RIP-I expressed in tissues of various types of plants affects disease resistance.']","Ricinus communis is native to Africa and India and has been used for millennia, by many cultural groups, for numerous medical and industrial purposes.

Structural similarities in the tertiary structures were identified among these lectins and several other lectins, including the galectins (see Chapter 36), as will be discussed in this chapter. For this reason, the term “L-type lectins” has recently been designated as a classification for all proteins with this legume seed lectin-like protein structure. The L-type lectins are distinguished from other lectins primarily based on tertiary structure and not the primary structure. In general, either the entire lectin monomer or the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of the more complex lectins is composed of antiparallel β-sheets connected by short loops and β-bends, and they usually lack any α-helices. These sheets form a dome-like structure related to the “jelly-roll fold,” which is often called a “lectin fold.” The carbohydrate-binding site is generally localized toward the apex of this dome.'
 'Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class.'

Both lectins display a related β-barrel (more...) Relationships between sequences of L-type lectins from legumes compared with the phylogeny of the various species within the Fabaceae family of plants suggest that these lectins most probably arose from divergent evolution. It remains an open possibility that the tertiary structures of some of the other members of the “L-type lectin family” arose by convergent evolution. It must also be noted that for a protein to be firmly placed in the L-type lectin category it must have the lectin fold and glycan-binding activity. All soluble L-type lectins found to date are multimeric proteins, although all do not have the same quaternary structure.'
 'Both the glycine and arginine form hydrogen bonds with the ligand via their main-chain amides. Loop C contains an invariant asparagine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via its side chain, and an invariant hydrophobic amino acid. Besides these invariant amino acids, backbone atoms of the residues of loop D also contribute to monosaccharide recognition.

The legume L-type lectins are generally classified into groups based on their carbohydrate specificities as often identified by the ability of monosaccharides to inhibit their agglutinating activity. These differences in specificities are brought about by variability in the conformation and size of the D loop and to some extent by the C loop.'
 'The tertiary structure of the monomer of ConA, the lectin from the seeds of the legume Canavalia ensiformis, is shown in Figure 32.1. The crystal structures of at least 20 other legume L-type lectin monomers have been determined by high-resolution X-ray crystallography and are almost superimposable on this structure. Thus, it is not surprising that the amino acid sequences of legume lectins show remarkable homology with one another and of the sequences of many other legume seed lectins sequenced but not yet crystallized. Fewer, but significant, homologies in primary structure have been found between legume L-type lectins compared with some L-type lectins from far distant sources, such as ERGIC-53 and VIP36, found in vertebrates. Yet, in other L-type lectins, no homology is found with the seed lectins, although they contain similar lectin folds.'
 'The lectins vary from one another as to whether the mature proteins contain oligomannose-type, complex-type, or a mixture of both types of N-glycans. The lectins may also undergo a variety of proteolytic modifications as they transit through the secretory system. Some of the lectins are cleaved to generate a β-chain, corresponding to the amino terminus and an α-chain corresponding to the carboxyl terminus. For example, the pea lectin and favin (the lectin from Vicia faba) are tetrameric glycoproteins that contain two types of subunits, α and β, which are ∼5 kDa and ∼21 kDa, respectively. These two lectins are each synthesized as single polypeptide precursors that contain the sequences of both chains in the following orientation: β-chain–α-chain. The chains associate to form dimers; they are then proteolytically processed in the protein bodies to form tetramers containing two separate α- and β-chains.']",All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet.,"The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet. The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand.",1.0,0.6342754378436501,0.6825800330697658,0.05,0.9999999999857143,0.3333333333333333

This secretion–recapture pathway is a minor one in most cells, but plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy. As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme.'
 'Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases. Late endosomes then undergo dynamic fusion/fission with lysosomes, allowing selective transfer of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes and leaving the MPRs behind in subdomains of the late endosomes. These MPRs may then either return to the TGN mediated by a multiprotein retromer complex or move to the plasma membrane, in which internalization via clathrin-coated pits occurs, mediated by the coat protein AP2. There are several pathways for the MPRs to be returned to the TGN from the various endosomal compartments, although the relative importance of the different pathways is unclear. Subcellular trafficking pathways of glycoproteins, lysosomal enzymes, and M6P receptors (MPRs). Newly synthesized glycoproteins originating from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pass through the Golgi stacks and are then sorted to various destinations.'
 'MPRs avoid delivery to lysosomes, in which they would be degraded. This trafficking is governed by a number of short amino acid sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. The TGN is the site in which newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes bind to MPRs that are then collected into clathrin-coated pits and packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to the early endosome. This process involves interaction of the MPRs with two types of coat proteins: the GGAs (Golgi-localized, γ-ear–containing, ADP-ribosylation factor binding) and AP1 (adapter protein 1). In addition to binding MPRs, the coat proteins recruit clathrin for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles. Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases.'
 'Interestingly, all these enzymes are actually synthesized by I-cells, but are mostly secreted into the medium, instead of being retained in lysosomes. Neufeld showed that although I-cells incorporated the high-uptake enzymes secreted by normal cells, enzymes secreted by I-cells were not taken up by other cells (Figure 33.1). She therefore proposed that I-cell disease results from a failure to add a common recognition marker to lysosomal enzymes. This marker was assumed to be responsible for the proper trafficking of newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes in normal cells. The “high-uptake” property was destroyed by strong periodate treatment, which oxidizes vicinal hydroxyl groups in glycans, predicting that the recognition marker was a glycan. High uptake of lysosomal enzymes was next found, by William Sly, to be blocked by M6P and its stereoisomer fructose 1-phosphate, but not by other sugar phosphates.'
 'With ACP2, the enzyme is synthesized initially as a membrane-bound protein, and once in the lysosome, it is proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature soluble form. Glucocerebrosidase is targeted to lysosomes independently of the MPR pathway by forming a complex with LIMP-2, a lysosomal membrane protein that contains a targeting signal in its cytoplasmic tail. Likewise, other integral membrane proteins of the lysosome use similar targeting motifs in their cytoplasmic tails to traffic to the lysosome. Furthermore, several M6P-independent cargo receptors for the transport of lysosomal enzymes have been identified such as the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), LRP2 (megalin), sortilin, and mannose receptors. A small number of proteins have now been identified that are related to the P-type lectins because of the presence of MRH domains. These MRH domains contain the residues that bind mannose, but lack the residues that bind phosphate.'
 'Fibroblasts from embryos that lack both receptors show a massive missorting of multiple lysosomal enzymes. Thus, both receptors are required for efficient intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes. Comparison of lysosomal enzymes secreted by the different cell types indicates that the two receptors may interact preferentially with different subgroups of enzymes. Thus, the structural heterogeneity of the M6P recognition marker within a single lysosomal enzyme and between different enzymes is one explanation for the evolution of two MPRs with complementary binding properties: that is, to provide an efficient but varied targeting of lysosomal proteins in different cell types or tissues. What initially appeared to be a precise lock-and-key mechanism turned out to be a far more complex and flexible system, with functionally useful biological flexibility. At steady state, MPRs are concentrated in the TGN and late endosomes, but they cycle constitutively between these organelles, early (sorting) endosomes, recycling endosomes, and the plasma membrane (Figure 33.5).'
 'For example, some cell types in the body may not express adequate levels of the CI-MPR on their surfaces to endocytose sufficient enzyme to restore normal lysosomal function. Also, the organ that is most seriously affected in many of these diseases (the brain) is inaccessible because of the blood–brain barrier. Although the first intraventricular M6P-dependent enzyme replacement therapy for children deficient for the lysosomal tripeptidyl peptidase 1 are very promising, further studies are needed. Although the MPR pathway has a major role in vertebrate lysosomal enzyme trafficking, its contribution in invertebrate systems is not prominent. Lysosomal enzymes are targeted in organisms such as Saccharomyces, Trypanosoma, and Dictyostelium, without the aid of identifiable MPRs.']","This secretion–recapture pathway, although a minor one in most cells, plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy. It involves the endocytosis of enzymes that bind to cell-surface MPRs via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, ultimately leading them to the same late endosomal compartments where newly synthesized molecules from the Golgi are also directed.","This secretion–recapture pathway is a minor one in most cells, but plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy. As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme. Some of these enzymes that are targeted to lysosomes via the M6P pathway have been prepared in large quantities as recombinant soluble proteins and used in enzyme replacement therapy. To date, the benefits have been variable but less than optimal. There are a number of potential reasons for this. First, some of the preparations may not contain the physiologic complement of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker. It is reasonable to suggest that a greater M6P content may improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement in these patients. This has been shown to be the case in mouse and dog model systems. However, even with fully phosphorylated enzymes there may be obstacles that are difficult to overcome.

 'However, because the CTLD is relatively shallow with few contacts to sugars, it is not possible to predict the glycan structures that bind to a particular CTL. In several CTLs, such as P-selectin and the AMR, Ca++ binding induces structural changes in the CRD that stabilize the double-loop region. Loss of Ca++ can lead to destabilization of these loops and loss of ligand binding, even when Ca++ is not directly involved in complexing the ligand, as seen in the macrophage mannose receptor. This destabilization is also important in pH-induced changes that lead to loss of ligand-binding affinity, because of the pH-induced loss of Ca++. In CTLD-containing proteins such as human tetranectin, which is not known to bind glycans, the CTLD can bind Ca++, but in the absence of Ca++ the CTLD is important for interactions with kringle-domain-containing proteins, such as plasminogen.

 'The CRD has two conserved disulfide bonds and up to four sites for binding Ca++, with site occupancy depending on the lectin. Amino acid residues with carbonyl side chains are often coordinated to Ca++ in the CRD, and these residues directly bind to sugars when Ca++ is bound in site 2. A ternary complex may form between a sugar, the Ca++ ion in site 2, and amino acids within the CRD, whereas the specific residues within the CRD determine sugar specificity. Key conserved residues that bind sugars include the “EPN” motif (which promotes binding to Man, GlcNAc, Fuc, and Glc) and “WND” motif (which promotes binding to Gal and GalNAc), as seen in mouse L-selectin and rat mannose-binding protein C (Figure 34.1).

 'Siglecs (Sia-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) constitute a Sia-binding family within the I-type lectins (Chapter 35). In humans, there are 14 Siglecs with sialic acid–dependent functions (13 and 17 are missing in humans and 12 does not bind sialic acid), all but one of which are found on the surface of different blood cell types. In several cases, binding of Siglecs to their sialoglycan targets on other cells or their own cell surface modulates ongoing immune responses, either damping them to protect from hyperimmune reactions or activating them. The one Siglec not found in the immune system, Siglec-4 (myelin-associated glycoprotein), is in the nervous system, where it aids cell–cell interactions between nerve cells and myelin, the protective and insulating membrane sheath essential to rapid nerve conduction.'
 'These counteract activating signals triggered by receptors containing ITAMs. Some Siglecs, notably Siglecs-14, -15, -16, and -H and mouse CD33, have a positively charged residue within the transmembrane region, which can associate with the DAP12 ITAM-containing adaptor, thereby mediating activating functions. Sn (CD169) was identified as a Sia-dependent sheep erythrocyte receptor expressed by mouse stromal macrophages. Sn has an unusually large number of Ig domains (seventeen), which are conserved among mammals and reptiles. These may be important for extending the Sia-binding site away from the plasma membrane to promote intercellular interactions. Sn prefers α2-3-linked Sias more than α2-6- and α2-8-linked Sias, and does not bind Sias modified by hydroxylation (Neu5Gc) or side-chain O-acetylation (e.g., Neu5,9Ac2).'
 'Siglecs also contain conserved hydrophobic amino acids on the A and G β-strands that interact with the N-acetyl group and glycerol side chain of Sia, respectively. Although all Siglecs appear to use a common template for recognizing Sias, their binding preferences for extended glycan chains vary greatly. The peptide loop between the C and C′ β-strands is highly variable among Siglecs and has a key role in determining their fine sugar specificity. For example, molecular grafting of the C–C′ loop between Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 resulted in switched sugar-binding specificities. Structural studies have shown that this loop appears to be highly flexible, being able to make specific and varied interactions with long glycan chains. In addition, V-set domain sequences are the most rapidly evolving regions in these molecules, likely explaining species differences in binding specificity.

 'Although the significance of this bond for ligand recognition is unclear, optimal Sia-binding activity of many Siglecs requires the adjacent C-set domain, probably for correct folding and stability.

Along with the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of Siglec-8, structural templates for Sia recognition by Siglecs appear to be shared among Siglecs.

The first animal lectin discovered was the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) identified by Anatol Morell and Gilbert Ashwell in the late 1960s during investigations of the turnover of a serum glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin. Like most glycoproteins circulating in blood, ceruloplasmin has complex N-glycans with sialic acid termini. To prepare radiolabeled ceruloplasmin, the terminal sialic acids were removed, leaving an exposed galactose. Surprisingly, asialoceruloplasmin had a circulation half-life (in rabbits) of minutes, whereas intact ceruloplasmin remained in the blood for hours. Glycoproteins with exposed Gal residues were rapidly cleared into liver cells via an endocytic cell-surface receptor that specifically bound to terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc.'
 'Glycosylation of ceruloplasmin was found to regulate its lifetime in the rabbit circulation; enzymatic desialylation of radiolabeled ceruloplasmin exposed penultimate β-linked Gal residues and caused rapid accumulation of asialoceruloplasmin into hepatocytes. Removal or modification of the exposed Gal residues lessened the rate of clearance. In 1974, the Ca++-dependent AMR was purified from rabbit liver by affinity chromatography on asialoorosomucoid-Sepharose. The rabbit AMR is a heterooligomer containing two subunits of 48 kDa and 40 kDa, whereas the human AMR contains two subunits of 50 kDa (H1) and 46 kDa (H2) that occur as a heterooligomeric type I transmembrane protein (trimers and high-order oligomers) comprised of small and large subunits.'
 'The efficiency of the AMR in endocytosis has led it to be a target for gene therapy and delivery of molecules to hepatocytes. Some C-type lectins (CTLs) are endocytic receptors. Ligands are internalized by clathrin-dependent pathways and delivered to early and then late endosomes. Receptors may be recycled or degraded, depending on the receptor and the type of ligand it endocytoses. (more...) The precise orientation of the trimers within the AMR can dictate its affinity to specific glycans that have multivalent presentations. The AMR binds glycans with terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc residues; however, tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans, with appropriate branching and presentation of nonreducing terminal Gal/GalNAc, bind to the rat AMR with >100,000× higher affinity (∼nm range) than ligands with a single terminal Gal/GalNAc residue.'
 'Glycoproteins with exposed Gal residues were rapidly cleared into liver cells via an endocytic cell-surface receptor that specifically bound to terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc. ASGPR was purified by affinity chromatography using a column of immobilized asialoglycoprotein. Other glycan-specific receptors involved in glycoprotein clearance and targeting were subsequently discovered, including mannose 6-phosphate receptors for targeting lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes (Chapter 33) and mannose receptors that clear glycoproteins with terminal mannose or GlcNAc residues from the blood. Small soluble lectins specific for β-linked galactose (now called “galectins”; Chapter 36) were isolated by affinity chromatography of extracts from many biological sources ranging from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum to mammalian tissues. By the 1980s, the concept of vertebrate lectins that recognize specific glycans was well established.'
 'The AMR internalizes its ligands captured at the cell surface at physiological pH; via coated pits, the AMR in complex with its ligand is internalized into coated vesicles (Figure 34.4), and changes in pH in late endosomes lead to dissociation of Ca++ from the AMR and release of ligand. The uncomplexed AMR then recycles to the plasma membrane, whereas the ligand is delivered to lysosomes where it is degraded. For some nonrecycling receptors (e.g., dendritic cell [DC]-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin [DC-SIGN]), both the ligand and receptor are targeted to lysosomes and degraded. Internalization of ligands by the AMR in hepatocytes is rapid, occurring in 2–3 minutes, and the receptor recycles to the surface within 4–5 minutes. The efficiency of the AMR in endocytosis has led it to be a target for gene therapy and delivery of molecules to hepatocytes.']","In addition to the discovery of the Ashwell–Morell asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR) in the liver, researchers identified a novel lectin called ""electrolectin"" in 1975. This lectin, isolated from electric eel organs, is a noncovalently linked homodimer with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa. It exhibited hemagglutinating activity towards trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes, which could be inhibited by β-galactosides. The inclusion of β-mercaptoethanol in the isolation buffers was necessary to maintain the binding activity of electrolectin.","Soon thereafter, in 1976, similar β-galactoside-binding lectins were isolated from chicken muscle and from extracts of calf heart and lung (∼15 kDa; now designated as galectin-1). These proteins were initially referred to as S-type lectins to denote their sulfhydryl dependency, presence of free cysteine residues, and solubility, along with shared primary sequence. In the early 1980s, a 35-kDa protein termed CBP35 that also bound to β-galactosides was identified in mouse fibroblasts. The same protein was studied by other groups under the names IgE-binding protein, L-29, and L-31 and is currently known as galectin-3. The nomenclature for galectins was systematized in 1994 and the first galectin type found (∼15 kDa, discussed above) retained the name galectin-1. All other members of this family were numbered consecutively by order of discovery.",1.0,0.6976804977035754,0.5440862253026262,0.02702702702702703,0.9150793650641138,0.0

 ""FimH prefers to bind D-mannose in the (more...) Most bacteria (and possibly other microorganisms) have multiple adhesins with diverse carbohydrate specificities. Many of these have been described (examples in Table 37.2), wherein the specificity of lectin binding can help define the range of susceptible tissues in the host (i.e., the microbe's ecological niche). The columnar epithelium that lines the large intestine expresses receptors with Galα1–4Gal-Cer residues, whereas cells lining the small intestine do not. Thus, Bacterioides, Clostridium, E. coli, and Lactobacillus only colonize the large intestine under normal conditions. P-fimbriated E. coli and some toxins bind specifically to galabiose (Galα1–4Gal) and galabiose-containing oligosaccharides, most commonly as constituents of glycolipids.""
 'An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips. The most well-characterized bacterial lectins include the mannose-specific type-1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding F-17 fimbriae, which are produced by different strains of Escherichia coli. Fimbriated bacteria express 100 to 400 of these appendages, which typically have a diameter of 5–7 nm and can extend hundreds of nanometers in length (Figure 37.3) Thus, pili extend well beyond the bacterial glycocalyx comprised of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharides (see Chapter 21). Escherichia coli express hundreds of pili, as indicated by the fine filaments extending from the bacterium. (Reprinted, with permission of Elsevier, from Sharon N. 2006.'
 'Binding can occur to either internal (i.e., when the disaccharide is capped by other sugars) or terminal nonreducing galabiose units. P-fimbriated E. coli adhere mainly to the upper part of the kidney, where galabiose is abundant. The fine specificity of bacterial surface lectins and their relationship to the animal tropism of the bacteria can be further illustrated by E. coli K99. The K99 strain binds to glycolipids that contain N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), in the form of Neu5Gcα2–3Galβ1–4Glc, but not to those that contain N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). These two sugars differ by a single hydroxyl group that is present only on Neu5Gc. Interestingly, Neu5Gc-containing receptors are expressed on the intestinal cells of newborn piglets, but disappear as the animals grow and develop.'
 'The envelope protein monomer is shown in ribbon form, displayed along its longitudinal axis and as an external side view. Note the alignment of positively (more...) Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity. Because the adhesins and the receptors often cluster in the plane of the membrane, the resulting combinatorial avidity can be great. An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips.'
 'In fact, the predicted binding sites for heparin in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) turned out to be incorrect once the crystal structure was determined. It is likely that binding involves multiple protein segments that juxtapose positively charged residues into a three-dimensional turn-rich recognition site. In many cases the binding involves loops which make the positioning more variable. An example of this phenomenon is observed in the chemokine CCL5, which contains a XBBXBX motif in a loop. The specific arrangement of residues should vary according to the type and fine structure of those oligosaccharides involved in binding. In lectins, and in antibodies that recognize glycans, the glycan recognition domains are typically shallow pockets that engage the terminal sugars of the oligosaccharide chain (Chapters 29, 30, and 37). In GAG-binding proteins, the protein usually binds to sugar residues that lie within the chain or near the terminus.']","This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells.

 'They typically recognize terminal groups on glycans, which fit into shallow but well-defined binding pockets (Chapters 29 and 30). In contrast, proteins that bind to sulfated GAGs (heparan, chondroitin, dermatan, and keratan sulfates; Chapter 17) do so via clusters of positively charged amino acids that bind specific arrangements of carboxylic acid and sulfate groups along GAG chains. Most of these proteins are evolutionarily unrelated. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GAG hyaluronic acid (hyaladherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that facilitates recognition of short segments of the invariant hyaluronan repeating disaccharide (Chapter 16), so they are best classified as lectins rather than grouped with sulfated GAG-binding proteins. The rest of this chapter emphasizes lectins, different families of which are detailed in Chapters 31–37. Sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also discussed, and are detailed further in Chapter 38.'
 'The chapters that follow describe the analysis of glycan–protein interactions (Chapter 29), the physical principles involved (Chapter 30), and the structures and biological functions of important subclasses of GBPs (Chapters 31–38). GBPs (which exclude glycan-specific antibodies) are found in all living organisms and fall into two overarching groups—lectins and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (compared in Online Appendix 28A). Lectins are further classified into evolutionarily related families identified by carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) based on primary and/or three-dimensional structural similarities (Figure 28.1). CRDs can exist as stand-alone proteins or as domains within larger multidomain proteins. They typically recognize terminal groups on glycans, which fit into shallow but well-defined binding pockets (Chapters 29 and 30).'
 'Sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also discussed, and are detailed further in Chapter 38. Representative structures from four common animal lectin families. The emphasis is on the extracellular domain structure and topology. The following are the defined carbohydrate-binding domains (CRDs) shown: (CL) C-type lectin; (GL) galectin; (MP) P-type (more...) Lectins were discovered in plants in 1888 when extracts of castor bean seeds were found to agglutinate animal red blood cells. Subsequently, seeds of many plants were found to contain such “agglutinins,” later renamed lectins (Latin for “select”) when they were found to distinguish human ABO blood groups (Chapter 14), important for blood transfusions. Lectins are particularly common in the seeds of leguminous plants and these “L-type” lectins, including concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin, have been extensively studied.'
 'Many other sulfated GAG-binding proteins were later discovered by affinity chromatography using columns of immobilized heparin. Growth factors and cytokines bearing clusters of positively charged amino acids along their protein surface interact with sulfated GAGs in a looser fashion—that is, they do not always show the high specificity seen with antithrombin. However, in some cases, specific GAG sequences mediate the formation of higher-order complexes, acting as a template for oligomerization or positioning of proteins such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its cell-surface receptor. GBPs function in communication between cells in multicellular organisms and in interactions between microbes and hosts and can also be involved in binding growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. These interactions can take various forms, resulting in movement of molecules, cells, and information. Directing movement of glycoproteins within and between cells is a common function for lectins in many organisms.'
 'The pattern of evolution of animal-specific lectins varies. Galectins seem to be similar in organization in vertebrates and invertebrates, and it may be possible to identify orthologs in quite diverse species (Chapter 36). In contrast, C-type CRDs have undergone independent radiation in vertebrates and invertebrates, and identifying orthologs even between mouse and human proteins in some cases is difficult (Chapter 34). Of the 12 different protein folds found in plant lectins, six appear to be unique to plants. It is also noteworthy that viruses seem to have developed their own approaches to binding glycans rather than borrowing from hosts (Chapter 37). In addition to families of proteins that share evolutionarily related CRDs, there are individual proteins that bind glycans through domains that are not related to CRDs in other proteins.'
 'In GAG-binding proteins, the protein usually binds to sugar residues that lie within the chain or near the terminus. Therefore, the binding sites in GAG-binding proteins consist of clefts or sets of juxtaposed surface residues rather than pockets. These GAG-binding sites on the protein surface give rise to more rapid GAG–protein binding kinetics than are typically observed for protein–protein interactions. Given that GAG chains generally exist in a helical conformation, only those residues on the face toward the protein interact with amino acid residues; the ones on the other side of the helix are potentially free to interact with a second ligand (e.g., as observed in FGF dimers). Alternatively, residues in a binding cleft could interact with both sides of the helix (e.g., in dengue envelope protein). Finally, one should keep in mind that binding occurs to only a small segment of the GAG chain.']","GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds like lectins, and instead, they seem to have evolved through convergent evolution. There have been hundreds of GAG-binding proteins identified, collectively forming the GAG-interactome and categorized into various classes as outlined in Table 38.1.","To a large extent, studies of the GAG-interactome have focused on protein interactions with heparin, a more highly sulfated, iduronic acid (IdoA)-rich form of heparan sulfate (HS; Chapter 17). This bias reflects, in part, the commercial availability of heparin and heparin-Sepharose, which are frequently used for fractionation studies, and the partially incorrect assumption that binding to heparin mimics binding to HS present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. There are also a large number of proteins known to interact with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) with comparable avidity and affinity; there are fewer examples of specific interactions with keratan sulfate (KS), but this may reflect fewer studies of KS. In some cases, CS may be the physiologically relevant ligand because CS predominates in many tissues.

The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages. First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. A cytoplasmic α-mannosidase cleaves up to four Man residues to generate Man5GlcNAc (Man c, d, e, f, and g in Figure 39.1). This glycan is then taken into the lysosome via an ATP-dependent lysosomal membrane transporter for final degradation to monosaccharides. Whether these free glycans have any function in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment before they are degraded has not been investigated.'
 'Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the pore by which ERAD-L substrates are actually transported to the cytosol has not been identified, it is known that the substrates must be unfolded in the ER lumen. Although studies on ERAD complexes have been mainly performed in S. cerevisiae, mammalian cells have homologs of nearly all proteins described in the yeast complexes. N-Glycans are removed from unfolded glycoproteins during proteasomal degradation. A cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, N-glycanase, NGLY1) plays an important role in both removing the glycan and constructing an efficient predegradation complex (Figure 39.3). NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins.'
 'A sizable fraction of nascent proteins fail quality control of folding and assembly in the rER (Chapter 39) and are retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm as a part of ERAD (ER-associated degradation), as depicted in Figure 18.1H. Most of these are N-glycosylated and normally processed by a cytoplasmic N-glycanase (NGLY1) or an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase) to remove their N-glycans before their degradation by the 26S-proteasome or an autophagic vacuole. There are also N-glycan-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligases that assemble polyubiquitin chains that serve as a signal for proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, NGLY1 is essential for mitochondrial turnover via mitophagy, although evidence suggests it functions via a role other than deglycosylating mitochondrial proteins.'
 'ER membrane proteins with folding defects in the cytosolic domain are extracted from the ER membrane by the Doa10 complex via ERAD-C, whereas those in which the folding defect is present in the luminal (ERAD-L) or membrane (ERAD-M) domains use the Hrd1 complex. Both Doa10p and Hrd1p are integral membrane proteins with E3 ligase activity in their cytosolic portion. Other proteins in these complexes include chaperones, proteins with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity or proteins that recognize misfolded proteins. For instance, glycoproteins with N-glycans containing a terminal α1–6Man are bound by Yos9p and undergo ERAD only if the N-glycans are in unstructured protein, a feature recognized by Hrd3p in the Hrd1 complex. Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner.'
 'These specialized chaperones require Ca++ for activity and bind to monoglucosylated forms of N-glycans, thus retaining the protein in the ER until proper folding occurs. The ER also contains three enzymes central to the process: α-glucosidases I and II (GI and GII), which trim glucose (Glc) from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 initially transferred to the protein and release the glycoprotein from CNX/CRT. The enzyme UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) reglucosylates the N-glycan if proper folding has not occurred. Glycoproteins that fail to fold, or to oligomerize properly, are marked with specific truncated N-glycans, and eventually retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm in which they are destroyed by N-deglycosylation and proteasomal degradation, a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). There are several ERAD pathways, which are described in the following sections.'
 'How are terminally misfolded glycoproteins driven to the proteasome for degradation? The key discriminating factor appears to be the structure of the truncated N-glycans that result from the relatively long stay of a misfolded glycoprotein in the ER lumen. Mammalian cells have, in addition to Man1B1, three additional homologs called EDEMs (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like) proteins, which initially were thought to be devoid of activity. However, when either Man1B1 or the EDEMs were individually knocked out in human or chicken cells, conversion of M9 to M8B (Figure 39.2) was mainly performed by EDEM2, and the contribution of Man1B1 to that particular demannosylation step was minimal. On the other hand, conversion of M8B to M7 lacking residues i and k (M7BC; Figure 39.1) was performed by EDEMs 1 and 3.'
 'On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface. Many congenital diseases such as lysosomal storage diseases also result in the accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER, thus overloading the folding machinery. An estimated 20%–30% of normal proteins misfold, so it is not surprising that small differences in the kinetics of conformational maturation and degradation can tip the balance to ERAD for lack of sufficient chaperones and other factors that facilitate folding. Although most glycoproteins transiently associate with CNX/CRT during their maturation in the ER in vivo, other ER folding and quality-control mechanisms do the job quite efficiently in cultured cells. However, viral glycoproteins such as vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, HIV glycoprotein gp120, and M protein from hepatitis B virus, absolutely require CNX/CRT for proper folding and exit from the ER.']","First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.

"Complete the following paragraph: The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation.","['The presence of abnormal glycans or the accumulation of glycans in the wrong place may negatively impact signaling pathways in animal cells. Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an ER-associated negative regulator of innate immunity. Mutations that affect TREX1 function are associated with numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Chapter 45). The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation. The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies.'
 'Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter. It is not known if these free glycans have any signaling functions in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment. In the lysosome, glycosidases hydrolyze the glycans into monomeric sugars that can then be reused by the cell.'
 'For instance, the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, CFTR-ΔF508, leads to improper folding of this chloride channel and its retention in the ER. Importantly, the mutation affects CFTR transit to the plasma membrane but not its transport activity. Similarly, UGGT recognition of a brassinosteroid receptor mutant triggers retention in the ER of Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Thus, certain diseases caused by ER retention of defective glycoproteins might be ameliorated by inhibitors of UGGT activity. One beautiful example of how the fine sensitivity of UGGT allows modulation of basic physiological processes is its role during antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I). Here, MHC I complexes loaded with suboptimal peptides are recognized by UGGT, thus triggering their retention in the ER. On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface.'
 'UGGT also glucosylates incompletely assembled multimeric complexes of fully mature monomers because it recognizes hydrophobic surfaces exposed in the absence of the appropriate subunits. UGGT is a relatively large, soluble, ER protein (150- to 170-kDa) that uses UDP-Glc as sugar donor and requires millimolar Ca++ concentrations, typically found within the ER lumen. UGGT has at least two domains. The amino-terminal one, comprising ∼80% of the molecule, recognizes abnormal protein conformers. This domain contains three tandemly repeated, thioredoxin-like domains that are frequently found in ER proteins involved in protein folding and quality-control processes. A crystal structure of the third domain showed that it contains a large hydrophobic patch hidden by a flexible carboxy-terminal helix. The carboxy-terminal domain has homology with other glycosyltransferases and is responsible for the catalytic activity.'
 'Like POFUT1, POFUT2 is an ER-localized enzyme that only fucosylates properly folded TSRs. POFUT2 and B3GLCT appear to function in a novel ER quality control pathway required for proper folding of TSRs. In thrombospondin-1, the region of the TSR modified with O-fucose mediates interactions between TSRs and several cell-surface receptors. Thus, the presence of O-fucose in this region could influence interactions between TSRs and adjacent cells, much as O-fucose on EGF repeats regulates Notch ligand binding. TSRs allow proteins like the thrombospondins to bind to cells and/or to other components in the ECM, an essential step in the antiangiogenic functions of these proteins. Modifications of thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs).

 'TSRs are also often frequently modified with C-mannose (Figure 13.4), although the relationship between the two modifications is not yet clear. A number of biologically interesting proteins are known or predicted to contain this modification, including thrombospondin-1 and -2, all ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; ADAMTS 1–20) and ADAMTS-like proteins, properdin, and F-spondin (Table 13.1). O-Fucosylation of TSRs in several proteins including ADAMTS 13 and ADAMTS-like 1 is needed for their secretion, suggesting that O-fucosylation of TSRs may be involved in quality control or folding, similar to the predicted role of O-fucose on EGF repeats in Drosophila. Like POFUT1, POFUT2 is an ER-localized enzyme that only fucosylates properly folded TSRs.'
 'The observation that reglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins occurs in the ER (Chapter 39) explains the need for an ER UDP-Glc transporter. Under stressful conditions, synthesis of lumenal uridine diphosphatase increases to accommodate increased transport of UDP-Glc needed for reglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins. The existence of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-Xyl transporters in the ER may mean that some reactions thought to occur exclusively in the Golgi may also occur in the ER. A good example is the synthesis of O-fucosylated proteins, such as Notch, in the ER versus fucosylation of N- and O-linked chains in the Golgi (Chapter 13). Other, as-yet-undiscovered, glycosylation reactions may also occur in the ER.']","This interaction between the ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 and the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex is suggested to play a role in stabilizing the catalytic activity of the OST complex, ultimately leading to the suppression of immune activation.","The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies. Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter. It is not known if these free glycans have any signaling functions in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment.",1.0,0.8577063628396191,0.7775093857817709,0.023255813953488372,0.9484126983968916,0.625

 'The number of fucoses per repeat, the linkage, and sulfation patterns all help ensure species selectivity for induction of the acrosome reaction. About 20% of the egg jelly mass is a large glycoprotein containing a unique polymer of sialic acid (Sia), which can be released from crude sea urchin egg jelly by treatment with mild base (β-elimination). The sialoglycan has a novel structure—[Neu5Gcα2-5-O-glycolylNeu5Gc]n. However, its receptor on the sperm membrane is unknown.

 'This may give some indication of the extent to which branching plays a role in recognition processes. Unique among mammals are free oligosaccharides present in milk. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are highly abundant in breast milk. Unlike most glycans that are conjugated to either proteins or lipids, HMOs are unconjugated in their native states. Thus, they contain a reactive aldehyde on the reducing end. HMOs decrease during lactation but are often even more abundant than proteins. Although the precise details of their synthesis are still not well known, HMO structures are more similar to glycans on glycolipids and O-glycans on proteins. The structures are based on a lactose core (Galβ1-4Glc) and extend either in branched or linear forms. Extensions are composed primarily of glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acids.'
 'Human milk contains ∼70 g/L of lactose and 5–10 g/L of free oligosaccharides. More than 130 different glycan species have been identified with lactose at the reducing end, including poly-N-acetyllactosamine units. Some glycans are α2-3- and/or α2-6-sialylated and/or fucosylated in α1-2, α1-3, and/or α1-4 linkages. In contrast, bovine milk, the typical mainstay in human infant formulas, contains much smaller amounts of fucose oligosaccharides. These differences may account for some of the physiological advantages seen for breastfed versus formula-fed infants. The glycans may also favor growth of a nonpathogenic bifidogenic microflora and/or block pathogen adhesion that causes infections and diarrhea.']","Genetic modifications that eliminate initial steps of major glycan synthetic pathways and of some monosaccharide biosynthetic pathways generally result in embryonic lethality, with one exception being deletion of individual genes needed for initiation of mucin O-GalNAc pathway, likely because of functional redundancy among the 20 different polypeptide:O-GalNAc transferases.

 'Samonella Typhi causes typhoid fever in humans, a process that begins with intracellular invasion of intestinal epithelial cells.

Once invasion has occurred, the secreted A2B5 typhoid toxin mediates illness by first binding preferentially to the sialic acid Neu5Ac, which is enriched in humans. Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), the cause of strep throat, as well as serious invasive infections, attaches to human pharyngeal and skin epithelial cells via interaction of its hyaluronan capsular polysaccharide with the host hyaluronan-binding protein CD44 (Chapter 16).

 'In fact, as few as two lysines in the correct orientation to each other and to an N-glycan can serve as minimal elements of the recognition domain. However, additional amino acid residues enhance the interaction with GlcNAc-P-T. In some instances (e.g., cathepsin D), the enzyme may contain a very extended determinant, or perhaps, more than one recognition domain. The GlcNAc phosphodiester glycosidase that catalyzes the exposure of the M6P recognition marker is found primarily in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and it cycles between this compartment and the plasma membrane. Thus, “uncovering” the recognition marker is a late event in the Golgi apparatus, occurring just before loading of the enzymes onto the M6P receptors (MPRs). Fibroblasts from patients with I-cell disease (also called mucolipidosis-II; ML-II) revealed a complete deficiency in GlcNAc-P-T enzyme activity.'
 'Thus, specific recognition by GlcNAc-P-T is crucial to achieve selective trafficking. This recognition is not explained by any similarities in the primary polypeptide sequences of lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, denatured lysosomal enzymes lose their specialized GlcNAc-P-T acceptor activity, indicating that features of secondary or tertiary structure are critical for recognition. Two complementary approaches were used to define elements of this recognition marker. In loss-of-function studies, various amino acids of the lysosomal enzyme were replaced with alanine, and the effect on phosphorylation determined. In gain-of-function experiments, residues of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D were substituted into the homologous secretory protease glycopepsinogen. These studies revealed that select lysine residues have a critical role in the interaction with GlcNAc-P-T. In fact, as few as two lysines in the correct orientation to each other and to an N-glycan can serve as minimal elements of the recognition domain.'
 'Interestingly, all these enzymes are actually synthesized by I-cells, but are mostly secreted into the medium, instead of being retained in lysosomes. Neufeld showed that although I-cells incorporated the high-uptake enzymes secreted by normal cells, enzymes secreted by I-cells were not taken up by other cells (Figure 33.1). She therefore proposed that I-cell disease results from a failure to add a common recognition marker to lysosomal enzymes. This marker was assumed to be responsible for the proper trafficking of newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes in normal cells. The “high-uptake” property was destroyed by strong periodate treatment, which oxidizes vicinal hydroxyl groups in glycans, predicting that the recognition marker was a glycan. High uptake of lysosomal enzymes was next found, by William Sly, to be blocked by M6P and its stereoisomer fructose 1-phosphate, but not by other sugar phosphates.'
 'With ACP2, the enzyme is synthesized initially as a membrane-bound protein, and once in the lysosome, it is proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature soluble form. Glucocerebrosidase is targeted to lysosomes independently of the MPR pathway by forming a complex with LIMP-2, a lysosomal membrane protein that contains a targeting signal in its cytoplasmic tail. Likewise, other integral membrane proteins of the lysosome use similar targeting motifs in their cytoplasmic tails to traffic to the lysosome. Furthermore, several M6P-independent cargo receptors for the transport of lysosomal enzymes have been identified such as the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), LRP2 (megalin), sortilin, and mannose receptors.

 'Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis. A few disorders can be treated by the consumption of monosaccharides.'
 'Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification. (For simplicity, disorders affecting multiple pathways are included in disorders (more...) Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans  The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation. The first were identified in the early 1980s based primarily on deficiencies in multiple plasma glycoproteins. The patients were also delayed in reaching growth and developmental milestones and had low muscle tone, incomplete brain development, visual problems, coagulation defects, and endocrine abnormalities. However, many of these symptoms are also seen in patients with other multisystemic genetic syndromes.'
 'A few disorders can be treated by the consumption of monosaccharides. The rapid growth in the number of discovered disorders, shown in Figure 45.1, has resulted in an evolution of disease nomenclature. Since 1999, CDGs were defined as genetic defects in N-glycosylation, but now the term is applied to any glycosylation defect. Nowadays, CDGs are categorized in four groups, comprising defects in N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and lipid and GPI-anchor glycosylation and defects that impact multiple glycosylation pathways. CDGs are named by the mutated gene followed by “-CDG” suffix (e.g., PMM2-CDG). Selected disorders are listed in Table 45.1 and all known disorders in Online Appendix 45A. Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification.'
 'Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms. The test was positive in these children, thereby, for the first time, indicating a generic defect in protein N-glycosylation. Lacking further details about glycan structures and the underlying genetic variants, Jaeken decided to call these cases “carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes” (CDGS). Several years later, many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases. To keep the acronym “CDG,” those involved also decided to call them “congenital disorders of glycosylation,” rather than inherited genetic defects in glycosylation. Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems.'
 'N-glycosylation defects may be divided into two types based on transferrin glycoforms. Type I (CDG-I) patients lack one or both N-glycans because of defects in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) or its transfer to proteins. Type II (CDG-II) patients have incomplete protein-bound glycans because of abnormal processing. The biosynthetic pathways and locations of N-glycan defects are shown in Figure 45.2. Congenital disorders of glycosylation in the N-glycosylation pathway. The figure shows individual steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, glycan transfer to protein, and N-glycan processing similar to Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4. The shuttling (more...) A complete absence of N-glycans is lethal. Therefore, known mutations mostly generate hypomorphic alleles encoding proteins with diminished activity.'
 'The discovery of CDG defects associated with trafficking proteins showed that the abnormal glycosylation linked to these disorders could arise from alterations in Golgi homeostasis and not only from impairment of the enzymes and transporters needed for glycosylation (Figure 45.5). Among the first of these trafficking proteins identified are subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex has multiple roles in trafficking within the Golgi, including the tethering of COPI-coated vesicles and recycling of Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases. COG7-CDG (Table 45.1) was discovered first. Trafficking of multiple glycosyltransferases and nucleotide sugar transporters were disrupted in COG7-CDG. The mutation affects the synthesis of both N- and O-glycans and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Mutations have now been found in all COG subunits except COG3.']","It was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found after the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980.","In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations.

 'However, the epitopes involved do not seem to be glycan-related. Another likely possibility is that the altered glycosylation changes interactions with Fc receptors. Glycans and their binding proteins are key to the pathogenicity of essentially all infectious diseases, and this topic is covered in greater detail in Chapters 37, 42, and 43. Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here. Many urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, which adhere to bladder epithelial cells via a mannose-binding lectin, FimH, located on the F-pilus of the bacterium. A simple and effective antibiotic-independent treatment and prevention for this very common infection is drinking D-mannose because it competes bacterial glycan binding to the urinary tract when it is excreted in the urine. Another alternative is optimized synthetic α-mannosides, which could treat and prevent UTIs.'
 'This can be accomplished by several distinct mechanisms and often confers properties of immune evasive and enhanced virulence. For example, the human-specific pathogen N. gonorrhoeae uses a surface sialyltransferase and scavenges the activated form of sialic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) from the host. Such incorporation thwarts multiple arms of the host complement system and confers resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPS). An Achilles’ heel of this increasingly drug-resistant pathogen may be the promiscuity of its sialyltransferase toward related nonulosonic acids. Unnatural incorporation of legionaminic acid (CMP-Leg5,7Ac2) in N. gonorrhoeae prevents the immune evasion benefits typically afforded by Neu5Ac; moreover, vaginal administration of CMP-Leg5,7Ac2 leads to more rapid bacterial clearance of genital infections in mice.'
 'For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition.'
 'Uroplakin Ia presents high levels of terminally exposed mannose residues that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers.

 'In bacteria, the role of these glycans is to provide a barrier that affords mechanical, chemical, and biological protection to the cell. Some pathogenic or commensal bacteria produce an outer glycan layer that mimics that of their hosts, in order to evade host immune surveillance (Chapters 15 and 42). Pasteurella multocida produces a thick hyaluronan capsule. Oral streptococci produce two GTs for adhesion and virulence, and the EPax GT enables colonization of the gut by Enterococcus faecalis. Other pathogens such as Escherichia coli K1 and Neisseria meningitidis produce a poly α2–8 sialic acid capsule. Mammalian gut bacteria produce capsular polysaccharides thought to help the maturation of the host immune system.'
 'Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host. Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors.']","Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here.

Given this selective advantage, it is not surprising that tumors are better at accumulating Neu5Gc in the face of an increased immune response.

This enzyme (Endo-N) and its inactivated form (which binds polySia) are powerful tools to study polySia functions. Neu5Gc is common in mammals including human's closest evolutionary relatives (bonobos and chimpanzees). However, it is not synthesized by humans, because of a fixed single-exon deletion mutation in the CMAH gene encoding a hydroxylase that converts CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc.

 'However, at the whole-body level, free Sias in the bloodstream derived from cellular sources or digestive processes are rapidly excreted in the urine. Thus, uptake of sialoglycoproteins (followed by lysosomal release by NEU1 and export by Sialin) may better account for the incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc in human tissues. In vertebrates, O-acetylated Sias are de-O-acetylated by Sia-specific O-acetylesterases, including the human enzyme coded by the SIAE gene, which may regulate B-cell development and immune tolerance by modulating recognition by Siglecs (Chapter 35). Enzymes with Sia 9-O-acetylesterase activity are also found in some bacteria and viruses. Influenza C virus and some coronavirus hemagglutinins bind specifically to 9-O-acetyl Sia for host infection, and their O-acetylesterases help in their further dissemination after newly budded virions are released from host cells.'
 'Why did the human lineage lose Neu5Gc? Many pathogens use Sias to bind and infect vertebrates (Chapter 42), and some specifically target Neu5Gc. An organism recognizing Neu5Gc may have been the cause of initial selection of the CMAH null state. Subsequent development of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in CMAH-null females may have then reduced fertility with CMAH-positive males by killing their sperm, possibly serving to speciate the null population. Other lineage-specific losses of Neu5Gc expression may have occurred in a similar fashion. This is part of a broader consideration of Sias as both a pathogen target and a physiological regulator, a combination that apparently contributed to rapid evolution of both Sia expression patterns and Sia-binding proteins, especially of the Siglecs (Chapter 35). Despite CMAH inactivation in humans, traces of Neu5Gc are found in normal human tissues.'
 'Although trans-sialidases tend to be specific regarding the sialyl linkage they generate, they can be promiscuous toward the donor and acceptor glycans. Once CMP-Neu5Ac is converted to CMP-Neu5Gc in the cytosol, there is no known way to reverse the reaction, perhaps explaining the accumulation of diet-derived Neu5Gc in human tissues. Further structural diversity in Sias is generated by enzymatic modification of Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn via reactions that occur in the lumen of the Golgi and related organelles, and on mature sialoglycoconjugates, as well as at the CMP-Sia level. Different enzymes may O-acetylate Sia at C-7/9 (most common) and C-4 (less common).'
 'By the time the relationship of these substances became evident, both names were already in use and have persisted. Although 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sometimes called “NANA”) is the most common sialic acid (Sia) in humans, the Sia family is comprised of related structures (Figure 15.1) that vary at the C-5 carbon, including 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (also known as 3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid, or Kdn) with a hydroxyl group at C-5.']","The unusual phenomenon of cancer patients expressing ""Hanganutziu-Deicher"" antibodies, which were later found to recognize gangliosides carrying the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) present in human tumors, has been explained by the metabolic incorporation of diet-derived Neu5Gc into human glycans.

 'These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants. ConA-Sepharose is commonly used to isolate glycoproteins as it shows little binding to nonglycosylated proteins. However, it does not bind all glycoproteins because it recognizes specific N-glycan structures. ConA-Sepharose has also been used to isolate free oligo- and polymannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary N-glycans. When combined in a serial format, multiple lectins can be used in affinity chromatography to isolate glycoconjugates containing most of the major glycan structures present in animal cells, with glycoconjugates being separated as classes that share common determinants. An example of serial lectin affinity chromatography is shown in Figure 48.8. Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications.'
 'Combinations of affinity chromatography and other chromatographic techniques can be very useful in identifying and separating glycopeptides. Thus, the ability of glycans to be recognized by lectins dependent on specific structural features in the glycans is a powerful tool for glycan identification and isolation. In some approaches, the glycans are tagged at the reducing end by fluorophores and radioisotopes or may be obtained by metabolic radiolabeling from cells or tissues grown in the presence of radiolabeled sugar precursors, such as [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans.'
 'Lower densities of ConA conjugation reduce its avidity for the glycoproteins and promote hapten dissociation of bound ligands with lower concentrations of sugars. When used in combination, multiple lectins, such as ConA, AAL (Aleuria aurantia lectin), LCA, and RCA (Ricinus communis agglutinin), can be used to isolate most glycoproteins containing N-and O-glycans from animal cells. This is a potentially powerful approach for glycoproteomics, or the identification of glycoproteins and their glycosylation status. Another approach to enhance glycoproteomic analyses is to use multiple lectins in mixed-bed or multi-lectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC). In such an approach a number of different lectins are used that recognize different glycan features, such as those shown in earlier figures in this chapter.'
 'Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications. Release of glycans coupled with ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can yield highly pure glycans with predicted structures that can then be confirmed by mass spectrometry of native and permethylated derivatives (Chapters 50 and 51).

 'Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans. When intact glycoproteins or complex polysaccharides (e.g., those found in plant cell walls [Chapter 24]) are analyzed for their interactions with plant lectins or antibodies, the interpretation of data may be complicated by the multivalency of the glycoprotein/polysaccharide and the density of the immobilized lectin/antibody. For example, glycoproteins containing multiple high-mannose-type N-glycans bind so tightly to immobilized ConA that it is difficult to elute the bound glycoprotein, even with extremely high concentrations of hapten and under harsh conditions. Lower densities of ConA conjugation reduce its avidity for the glycoproteins and promote hapten dissociation of bound ligands with lower concentrations of sugars.']","The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) was isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized yeast mannans containing phosphorylated mannose.

 'Subsequently, genetic screens were performed using HAP1 (haploid) human cells mutagenized by retroviral gene trap.

Although this technique has great specificity, its limited capacity makes detection of rare mutants difficult, and mutagenesis before screening is usually a requirement. The resulting strains must be cloned and carefully characterized for stability and the biochemical and molecular basis of mutation. Additional genetic analyses include somatic cell hybridization for dominance/recessive testing and assigning mutants to different genetic complementation groups. Specifically, when mutations are introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), the affected genes can be identified through deep sequencing analysis of enriched sgRNA populations.'
 'CHO cells thus became a focus for experiments to decipher glycosylation pathways and, importantly, provided mutant host cells for the production of viruses and glycoproteins with modified glycans. This proved to be extremely beneficial to the biotechnology industry because most recombinant therapeutics are glycoproteins. CHO cells and CHO glycosylation mutants are now the workhorse of the biotechnology industry. They are particularly useful because they produce only minor, if any, quantities of nonhuman glycans or glycan modifications that give rise to undesirable antibodies. Conserved glycosylation pathways in yeast were delineated by similar approaches (Chapter 23). Mutants in any cell type often accumulate the precursor immediately upstream of the block in a pathway and thereby reveal the structure of their substrate(s). Sequencing of mutant alleles reveals specific mutations that may give rise to a glycosylation phenotype.'
 'Fibroblasts or lymphoblasts can be obtained readily from humans with a disorder of glycosylation (Chapter 45). Cells may be grown as primary cultures or immortalized by viral transformation. By crossing mutant mice with the Immortomouse, which carries a temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen in every cell, immortalized mutant cell lines can be derived from essentially any cell type. For mutations that cause embryos to die during gestation, mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells can be derived from blastocysts, provided the mutation does not result in cell-autonomous lethality. The resulting mutant ES cell lines can be used to investigate functions for specific glycans during differentiation in embryoid cell culture, or in vivo in mouse chimeras. A chimera is obtained by injecting wild-type or mutant ES cells into the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst. If the ES cells survive, the resulting mouse is a mixture of cells derived from the ES cells and cells derived from the blastocyst and is termed a chimera.'
 'Many of the cell lines described in this chapter are available through the American Type Culture Collection. The success of bacterial and yeast genetics in isolating mutants and using them to define biochemical pathways led in the late 1960s to the development of somatic cell genetics using mammalian cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were selected by two independent groups for initial experiments to isolate stable mutants. Somatic cell genetic strategies were applied early to glycobiology, yielding numerous mutants in glycoprotein biosynthesis and later in proteoglycan, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and glycolipid biosynthesis. The ability to isolate glycosylation mutants in mammalian cells made it possible to unravel pathways of glycan synthesis and degradation and to identify, isolate, and map structural and regulatory genes. CHO cells thus became a focus for experiments to decipher glycosylation pathways and, importantly, provided mutant host cells for the production of viruses and glycoproteins with modified glycans.'
 'This conclusion has been driven home by gene ablation studies in mice and further evidenced by the discovery of human genetic diseases which arise from mutations in genes involved in glycosylation (Chapter 45). CHO cells have become the cells of choice for the biotechnology industry in the production of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins and in glycosylation engineering (see Chapter 56). For example, CHO cells lacking FUT8, which adds fucose to the core GlcNAc of complex N-glycans, are used to produce cytotoxic therapeutic antibodies that have a greatly enhanced ability to kill their target cells. In another example, CHO cells with multiple mutations that simplify N- and O-glycans are being used by X-ray crystallographers to produce homogeneous preparations of membrane glycoproteins with highly truncated N- and O-glycans, greatly facilitating their crystallization. Somatic cell genetics arose from the desire to manipulate the genome of cultured cells in vitro.']","To greatly increase the probability of finding desirable mutants, mutations may be induced by treating cells with chemical (e.g., alkylating agents), physical (e.g., ionizing radiation), or biological (e.g., a virus) mutagens or, perhaps more likely, by lentiviral transduction with CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide or focused libraries. This approach is particularly important in mammalian cells where the frequency of finding recessive mutants is low due to their diploid nature, and immortalized cells being often hyperploid. By inducing mutations using various methods, researchers can enhance the chances of identifying valuable mutants for further study and applications in glycosylation engineering.","Regardless of the method used to induce mutations, selection or enrichment is usually needed to find rare recessive or dominant mutants bearing a desired glycosylation phenotype (Figure 49.1). For example, direct selection for resistance to cytotoxic plant lectins (Chapters 31 and 32) that bind to cell-surface glycans gives a range of glycosylation mutants. Importantly, many mutants resistant to one or more lectins because of the loss of specific sugars become supersensitive to a different group of lectins that recognize sugar residues exposed by the mutation (Figure 49.2). The latter may be used to select for revertants in the original mutant population. Nontoxic lectins are also useful for enriching lectin-binding mutants (e.g., by flow cytometry). Mutations that affect all stages of glycosylation reactions, including the generation and transport of nucleotide sugars, have been identified using lectins as selective agents.",,0.6602845448009254,0.6849677355921584,0.09090909090909091,0.9150793650641138,1.0
Complete the following paragraph: Linkage analysis is a well-established and ingenious approach for determining linkage positions. The principle of this method is to introduce a stable substituent (an ether-linked methyl group) onto each free hydroxyl group of the native glycan.,"['This is referred to as fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). Linkage analysis is a well-established and ingenious approach for determining linkage positions. The principle of this method is to introduce a stable substituent (an ether-linked methyl group) onto each free hydroxyl group of the native glycan. Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide.'
 'This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide. However, linkage analysis provides no information on the nature of substituents or sequence information and cannot reveal α- or β-anomeric configuration. (See following page.) An example of linkage analysis showing a bacterial O-linked branched hexasaccharide with a sequence of Rha1-3Glc1-(Glc1-3GlcNAc1-)2,6Glc1-6GlcNAc. The O-glycan is reductively eliminated from protein before successive steps of permethylation, (more...) EI-MS in monosaccharide composition and linkage analyses is covered above.'
 'A wealth of information exists on the chemical generation of glycans and various protecting group manipulations used in the context of glycan synthesis. A glycosidic linkage is generally formed through the activation of a glycosylating agent (glycosyl donor) to create an electrophilic species that reacts with the nucleophile, for example, a hydroxyl group present on the glycosyl acceptor. Other possible acceptors include serine/threonine in the case of glycopeptides or a sphingoid in the case of glycosphingolipids. The glycosylation reaction results in the formation of either an α- or β-glycosidic linkage (see Chapter 2). A major challenge in glycan synthesis is the stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds (Figure 53.1A; Chapter 2). A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages.'
 'This 1H is frequently across the glycosidic bond at the linkage site, providing a way to assemble residues into a complete structure. However, caution must be exercised. The identification of linkage sites is not as definitive as with 13C-based experiments, because the distance for the trans-glycosidic pair is dependent on glycosidic torsion angles, and these NOE crosspeaks can be weak. Also, other nonlinkage site protons can come within NOE distance and give false identification. The same NOE crosspeaks that assist in identifying linkages between residues can, in principle, be used to define the tertiary (3D) structure of a glycan. However, the interpretation is complicated by the presence of internal molecular motion, resulting in many different conformations in solution. This motion is nicely illustrated in ϕ–ψ energy plots much like the Ramachandran plots used to describe the energetics of torsional angles in the polypeptide backbone of a protein.'
 'A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages. The yield and the stereochemical outcome of these reactions depend on the steric and electronic nature of the glycosylating agent (the glycosyl donor), the nature of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions. One common method to control the stereochemistry at the anomeric center involves the use of certain protecting groups, such as esters or amides/carbamates, on the C2-hydroxyl or C2-amino group (Figure 53.1B). These “participating neighboring” protecting groups can form a cyclic oxonium ion intermediate during the glycosylation reaction that shields one face of the molecule, leading exclusively to the formation of a “trans”-glycosidic linkage (i.e., where the anomeric substituent and the C2 group are on opposite sides of the ring, as in β-glucosides).'
 'An overview of glycan synthesis strategies is provided in Chapters 53 and 54. The hydroxyl groups present in both monosaccharides and oligosaccharides can be chemically modified without affecting the glycosidic linkages. Methylation is used in the structural analysis of glycans (see Chapter 50). Natural products containing partially methylated glycans are known and a number of methyltransferases have been identified. A variety of different enzymes can esterify the hydroxyl groups of glycans to transiently vary glycan structure. Esterification is sometimes required for interactions with other biomolecules. The most important types of sugar esters in nature are phosphate esters (including diphosphate esters), acyl esters (with acetic acid or fatty acids), and sulfate esters. Acyl esters can sometime migrate to other hydroxyl groups on the same monosaccharide. The replacement of monosaccharide hydroxyl groups with hydrogen atoms forms deoxysugars.'
 'These modified proteins are thought to underlie some of the pathologies associated with diabetes. Two monosaccharide units can be joined together by a glycosidic bond—this is the fundamental linkage among the monosaccharide building blocks found in all oligosaccharides. The glycosidic bond is formed between the anomeric carbon of one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group of another. In chemical terms, a hemiacetal group reacts with an alcohol group to form an acetal. Glycosidic bonds can be formed with virtually any hydroxylated compound, including simple alcohols such as methanol (Figure 2.13) or hydroxy amino acids such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Indeed, glycosidic linkages are formed between sugars and these amino acids within proteins to form glycoproteins (see Chapters 9 and 10).']","This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide.","Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol).

 'The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle.

Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation. However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome.'

 'Clues regarding the composition and complexity of the glycome are found in the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of a cell. Thus, if a gene encoding a glycosyltransferase is not expressed (absent from the transcriptome), no glycans in that cell can carry the sugar transferred by that glycosyltransferase at that particular time. The action of many glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases competing for the same substrates in the biosynthetic pathway renders the complete glycome impossible to predict with current tools and knowledge. As an example, the reduced expression of a single glycosyltransferase can perturb the biosynthesis of dozens of glycans. Furthermore, unlike the genome, the glycome is sensitive to exogenous nutrient levels and metabolic fluxes including salvage pathways.'
 'Different approaches and techniques are required to characterize, for example, the structures of glycoproteins versus glycolipids, N-glycans versus O-glycans, and sulfated GAGs versus neutral glycans (Chapter 50). In contrast, a single technique such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to identify and quantitate all mRNA transcripts at once, a much easier task. Glycomic methods and analyses have been mostly directed toward protein glycosylation because of the current proteomics focus, although considerable effort is being directed toward methods that encompass all glycan conjugates. As an example of a typical experiment, a glycoprotein-enriched sample is prepared from a cell lysate and their released glycans analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) and/or mass spectrometry (MS).'
 'The term “glycomics” thus describes studies designed to define the complete repertoire of glycans that a cell, tissue, or organism produces under specified conditions of time, location, and environment. “Glycoproteomics” describes this glycome as it appears on the cellular proteome. Glycoproteomics determines which sites on each glycoprotein of a cell are glycosylated and ideally includes the identification and quantitation of the heterogeneous glycan structures at each site. The molecular complexity of the glycoproteome makes glycomics and glycoproteomics both exciting and daunting. Because neither the genome, transcriptome, nor the proteome can accurately predict the dynamically expressed protein-linked glycans, the glycome and glycoproteome must be analyzed directly. Techniques used to characterize a single glycoprotein after isolation (Figure 51.1) or a complex mixture of glycoproteins (the glycoproteome) (Figure 51.2) are described in this chapter. Analysis of a purified single glycoprotein.'
 'Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27). The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward.']","Most eukaryotic proteins are post translationally modified, which adds complexity to the proteome.

GlycoRDF is now being used by several glycomics database providers, to enable large-scale integration of diverse data collections in the glycosciences.'
 'Glycoinformatics enables the development of streamlined data reporting and sharing standards. For glycoproteins, the structures of both the glycan and the protein must be represented along with the relationship between these two entities (e.g., the identity of the glycosylation site and the fraction of the protein molecules that bear the glycan in each physiological state). To make this information relevant, the scientist often requires explicit information about the biological context (e.g., tissue and disease state) corresponding to the specified glycosylation or describing how the glycosylation changes when the tissue or cell is perturbed. The glycoscience community is building on the efforts of the Human Proteome Organization-Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to develop similar resources that describe the information that should be included when reporting experimental data, with digital data exchange formats to facilitate communication of structural and biological information and controlled vocabularies that allow the data that is exchanged to be unambiguously interpreted.'
 'The future of current endeavors in glyco-related informatics lies in the consolidation of international consortia. The small size of the glycoscience community has prompted several cooperative initiatives across all continents for representing and collecting glycomics data (as described above). To favor interactions between these complementary initiatives, the international Glycome Informatics Consortium (GLIC) was founded in 2015 to provide and maintain a centralized software resource for developers, thus enabling cooperative database and tool development. Also in 2015, a Glycomics section was established on the Swiss Institute For Bioinformatics (SIB) Expasy proteomics resource portal, and glycoprotein entries in UniProtKB have been also linked to glycan structural information, when known, in GlyGen and GlyConnect. In addition, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the Common Fund Glycoscience Program is now focused on creating new methodologies and resources to study glycans that include the development of data integration and analysis tools.'
 'Because a common vocabulary, or ontology, would be used across different publications in different websites (i.e., journals), the terminology used to encapsulate the semantics is preserved. Therefore, the Semantic Web becomes a virtual online database in which all linked data can be queried directly, without any need to transfer large amounts of data. Moreover, with such data available on the Semantic Web, machine learning technologies allow computers to make inferences based on the data available, just as a researcher would think of new hypotheses. The essential accurate interpretation of glycoanalytical data for glycan structure determination requires well-documented metadata, including the parameters used to acquire and process the raw data along with supporting biological source information for the sample being analyzed. The MIRAGE initiative was formed to develop guidelines for researchers to report the qualitative and quantitative results obtained by diverse types of glycomics analyses (e.g., chromatography, mass spectrometry, and glycan/lectin arrays).'
 'These unique identifiers, however, provide the semantic foundation required for individuals or databases to effectively communicate by recording the identifier of the structures they have characterized. Many advances in glyco-related databases and informatics tools development have focused on the interpretation and storage of analytical data, including liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), interaction arrays, mass spectrometry (MS), and three-dimensional (3D)/modeling/nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table 52.2). Glycoinformatics data analysis software tools  Most efforts so far have focused on tools that assist the interpretation of MS data. A number of commercial and publicly accessible software are now available. Introduced in 1999, the widely used GlycoMod was the first glycoinformatics Web-based tool to be released in this context, and its function is to suggest possible glycan compositions from experimental mass values of either free or derivatized glycans or glycopeptides.'
 'For example, the Minimum Information Required for A Glycomics Experiment (MIRAGE) initiative is modeled after the well-established Minimum Information for A Proteomics Experiment (MIAPE) initiative of HUPO-PSI. These standards are required for the emergence of glycobiology as a mature discipline that is accessible to the scientific community as a whole. A major component of databases is the standardized depiction of the glycan structures. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) (see Online Appendix 1B) universal symbol nomenclature for the graphical representation of glycan structures has been developed to facilitate such standardization and is used throughout this book. Online Appendix 52A lists current databases and journal publishers that have thus far accepted or strongly recommend the use of this nomenclature. A variety of drawing software has been developed to simplify the usage of the SNFG (Online Appendix 1B).'
 'When linked to other relational databases, glycoscience data may then be integrated with related genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic information. This chapter describes the current status of glycoinformatics databases and software development, with focus on efforts to bridge the gap between glycan structure and function. Informatics plays a critical role in virtually every aspect of modern biology. Our ability to compile the genomes of diverse organisms made it possible to predict the protein sequences. These sequences are widely used as the basis to predict protein function and to enable proteomic analyses. Proteomic studies in turn advance biological research by providing experimental evidence that supports the expression of specific proteins, in particular tissues or cell types (Figure 52.1). The informatics resources that support these endeavors are facilitated by the fact that genes and the translated polypeptides (i.e., proteins) are typically linear molecules whose sequences are readily specified as a series of characters.']","Another effort, GlycoRDF, is a proposed standard ontology for glycan and related metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide consistent terminologies for representing glycan sequences, related biological sources, publications, and experimental data on the Semantic Web.

Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents.

 'Because of their stereochemistry and water solubility, organic synthesis of glycans has proven to be one of the most challenging areas of synthetic organic chemistry (Chapter 53). The combined use of purified glycosyltransferases with chemically synthesized glycan precursors has proven to be invaluable in the stereoselective synthesis of complex glycans (Chapter 54). Automated synthesis of glycans is rapidly becoming a reality, and even the synthesis of the most complex glycans, such as glycosaminoglycans, is becoming possible. In the past five years, major advances have been reported in both the automated chemical and the automated chemico-enzymatic synthesis of complex glycans. In the future, it seems likely that the synthesis of glycans will become nearly as facile and widely available as the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. It should be possible for biologists to easily obtain glycoconjugates that have homogeneously uniform glycans to further explore the structural and functional roles of the glycans.'
 'With the commercialization of AGA in which a set of common building blocks is combined on a solid phase resin, the synthesis process can be greatly accelerated. AGA has become an important part of carbohydrate synthesis as polysaccharides as long as 100-mers as well as glycosaminoglycans are now rapidly accessible in multimilligram quantities. The production of highly branched structures will become routine in the coming years. Still, for challenging targets, containing rare monosaccharides and 2-deoxy and 1,2-cis-linkages, improved methods for solution phase synthesis will have to be developed. These methods will greatly benefit from the advances in fundamental knowledge on the glycosylation reaction and will be aided by knowledge gathered in databases. In addition, enzymatic synthesis and combinations of chemical and enzymatic synthesis are important assets to procure large quantities of glycans. The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Nathaniel Finney and David Rabuka and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Martina Delbianco.'
 'The combination of organic synthesis and chemoenzymatic synthesis will allow the production of well-defined glycan arrays that contain the various binding epitopes for glycan-binding proteins. Recombinant glycosyltransferases will become common tools to generate specific glycans on glycoproteins and living cells, and these enzymes will greatly enhance the many studies that now rely on the use of lectins (Chapter 48), whose specificity is often not well-defined. Finally, the rapidly expanding analytical toolkit will be instrumental to decipher the regulatory mechanisms that mediate homeostasis of glycoconjugates at a cellular level. As with analytical methods, it is also important to “democratize” the approaches by developing simple methods for the average biologist working at the bench. In recent years, great advancements in the glycomic profiling of glycans from cells, tissues, or organisms have occurred.'
 'Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states. Significant progress has also been made in Systems Glycobiology by better integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Our understanding as to how miRNAs and transcription factors regulate glycan expression has also improved in the last few years (Chapters 51 and 52). At the present time, the study of glycan structure/function relationships requires highly specialized expertise in synthetic and analytical chemistry. The inherent difficulty in studying glycans remains a major challenge preventing glycobiology—the study of glycan function—from entering mainstream conceptual frameworks of biology. In response to this challenge, strong emphasis has recently been placed on the development of facile technologies that will allow nonglycobiologists without specialized analytical chemistry skills to study glycans in a meaningful way.'
 'Less detailed information on structure may be sufficient to explore the biology of some glycans and can be obtained by simple techniques, such as the use of enzymes (endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases), lectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 48 and 50), chemical modification or cleavage, metabolic radioactive labeling, antibodies, or cloned glycosyltransferases (Chapters 53 and 54). Glycosylation can also be perturbed in various ways, for example, by glycosylation inhibitors and primers (Chapters 55 and 56) and by genetic manipulation of glycosylation in intact cells and organisms (Chapter 49). Directed in vitro synthesis of glycans by chemical and enzymatic methods has also made great strides in recent years, providing many new tools for exploring glycobiology (Chapters 53, 54, and 57).']","The chapter provides an overview of the current state of the art in chemical methods for producing glycans. Chemical synthesis is crucial for obtaining homogeneous glycans in larger quantities compared to those produced in biological systems, which are often heterogeneous and limited in quantity. Additionally, chemical synthesis can be utilized to incorporate glycans into homogeneous glycoproteins, further advancing research in glycobiology.","Enzymes can be used together with chemical methods to prepare diverse glycans (Chapter 54). The structure of oligosaccharides render their synthesis more complicated than the synthesis of the other major classes of biomolecules: oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11). The choice of protecting groups and the order of protecting group installation are essential for a successful synthetic route.",0.8,0.21530115324418922,0.7392610253610981,0.02127659574468085,0.9999999999833333,0.5555555555555556

Hexosaminidases, both exo- and endo-types, hydrolyze N-acetylglucosamine-containing glycosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric configuration. In contrast to most other retaining glycosidases, some retaining hexosaminidases do not employ an enzyme active site nucleophile in the nucleophilic displacement of the aglycon, but rather utilize the N-acetyl group in the substrate for this purpose (Figure 54.8, insert).'
 'Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides.  The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis.

 'Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans.  The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4).'
 'Introduction of GlcNAcT-I (MGAT1) in the Golgi initiates complex N-glycan synthesis, and further addition of α3/6-mannosidase II (MAN2A1) and GlcNAcT-II (MGAT2) results in the biantennary GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 N-glycan suitable for appending galactose and sialic acid by further engineering. Some yeast species, including Pichia pastoris, do not contain UDP-Gal, and all yeast lack the native ability to synthesize CMP-Neu5Ac, so considerable engineering with introduction of multiple genes is required to obtain mature complex N-glycans. Although the engineering appears simple in silico, considerable efforts have been devoted to identifying optimal chimeric gene constructs with respect to both catalytic efficiency and ER/Golgi targeting.'

 'The crystal structure for influenza neuraminidase was obtained in 1983, and many other enzymes have since been characterized from other sources. Even before the crystal structure had been obtained, a neuraminidase inhibitor was designed by assuming that the hydrolysis reaction involved an oxocarbenium ion–like transition state with significant positive charge accumulation at the anomeric center. This would result in C-2 and C-3 adopting a planar configuration, and therefore compounds that mimicked this geometry were hoped to have inhibitory activity. Indeed, Neu5Ac-2-ene (DANA; Figure 55.6) has a micromolar Ki value. Interestingly, this compound inhibits most sialidases, but does not inhibit the trypanosome trans-sialidase and only weakly bacterial sialidases. Structure of neuraminidase inhibitors.'
 'Next-generation analogs of Relenza including the close derivative laninamivir as well as the guanidinium-containing peramivir have also been developed. The presence of the guanidinium group requires these drugs to be either inhaled or injected. Subsequent studies focused on dispensing this functionality. Replacement of the pyranose ring with a cyclohexene to mimic the planar ring of the proposed intermediate in hydrolysis, protecting the carboxylate as an ester that is hydrolyzed after ingestion, and replacing the guanidinium with an amine led to an orally active, widely used analog, the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu (Figure 55.6; Chapter 57). Crystal structures for other sialidases have allowed the design of species-specific analogs. This rational approach to inhibitor design holds great potential, not only for neuraminidase inhibitors, but also, as described above, for O-GlcNAcase and OGT inhibitors.'
 'These enzymes provide excellent examples of successful rational design and medicinal chemistry efforts directed to the development of glycoside hydrolase and glycosyltransferase inhibitors. Alloxan and streptozotocin affect O-GlcNAc addition, but these compounds lack specificity. The first potentially useful OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1; Figure 55.3) was obtained by screening chemical libraries for compounds that displaced a fluorescent derivative of the donor sugar, UDP-GlcNAc. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry led to quinoline-containing ester (OSMI-4), which is a high-quality OGT inhibitor that is effective in cells. The active compounds do not block other N-acetylglucosamine addition reactions—for example, one involved in formation of the polysaccharide backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan (Chapter 21). In addition, 5SGlcNAc is another inhibitor of OGT that acts as a metabolic precursor leading to formation of UDP-5SGlcNAc.'
 'A rationally designed glucoimidazole, GlcNAcstatin, also potently inhibits O-GlcNAcase with good selectivity over HexA and HexB. These compounds inhibit the enzyme in cells and tissues, and Thiamet-G, in particular, has been used in animal models, providing new tools to study the function of O-GlcNAc. Use of these compounds has uncovered the potential of O-GlcNAcase inhibitors in various neurodegenerative diseases, which has spurred industrial pharmaceutical interest that has led to OGA inhibitors, such as the Thiamet-G analog MK-8719 (Figure 55.3), advancing into Phase I clinical trials. Noncarbohydrate O-GlcNAcase inhibitors have also been uncovered, and highly potent brain permeable analogs have been used as positron emission tomography agents to examine the inhibition and distribution of O-GlcNAcase in human brain.'

In some bacteria, EF-P suppresses translational stalling by a mechanism that involves oxidation of a critical lysyl residue, and its eukaryotic ortholog is regulated by hypusylation.'
 'Introduction of GalNAc residues has been used for postexpression enzymatic addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatized sialic acids to enhance the therapeutic properties of protein drugs. Other bacteria possess a protein O-glycosylation mechanism that is unlike the stepwise biosynthesis of O-glycans in eukaryotes (Chapter 10), in that preassembled undecaprenol-PP-linked oligosaccharides are transferred en bloc to proteins by several OSTs with relaxed donor substrate specificities and poorly understood acceptor substrate specificities. Engineering of this endogenous glycosylation machinery has been used for en bloc transfer of human O-GalNAc glycans (Tn, T, sialyl-Tn, and sialyl-T antigens) onto acceptor proteins (Table 56.1). Yeast natively produce N-glycans and O-mannosyl glycans on diverse glycoproteins.'
 'The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10).'
 'The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER. On binding to the catalytic STT3 subunit, the client peptide adopts a 180° turn, making polypeptide folding a competing reaction for N-glycosylation. Indeed, the thioredoxin subunits of the OST complex (Ost3p/Ost6p; MAGT1/TUSC1) modulate the oxidative folding of the client polypeptide, thereby extending the polypeptide substrate range of OST. As of February 2021, the UniProt database reports 1911 N-glycosylation sites in yeast and 13,648 in murine glycoproteins.'
 'The OST of C. jejuni, PglB, is a single polypeptide related to the catalytic STT3 subunits of the multiprotein OST complex of eukaryotes (Chapter 9). PglB shows a more restricted acceptor sequence motif than the eukaryotic N-X-S/T, with requirement of an acidic residue (D/EXNXS/T, in which X cannot be P) (Chapter 21). This places some restrictions on the usefulness of engineering human-like N-glycans, because most N-glycan sites in mammalian proteins do not conform to this extended consensus sequence. PglBs from other species, or mutants evolved by adaptive evolution, have been identified to address this problem, but further improvements are needed. Importantly, PglB has rather relaxed donor substrate specificity. Although bacterial lipid-linked oligosaccharides are distinct from those in eukaryotes, PglB can use mammalian-type lipid-linked oligosaccharides as donors.']","This type of N-glycosylation in γ-proteobacteria, facilitated by the cytosolic N-glycosyltransferase (NGT), utilizes the N-X-S/T acceptor sequence motif recognized by mammalian OST. NGT transfers a single monosaccharide, such as Glc, from an activated sugar nucleotide donor. Notably, NGT exhibits loose donor substrate specificity, accommodating both UDP and GDP sugar nucleotides. This unique mechanism offers a novel avenue for engineering diverse forms of N-glycosylation.","Engineering this pathway in bacteria resulted in the assembly of glycan motifs including α1-3-galactose epitopes as well as fucosylated and sialylated lactose or poly-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units primed by Glc residues on glycoproteins (Table 56.1). Although most bacteria do not have the capacity for sialylation, there are exceptions (Chapters 15 and 21). Bacterial genes for CMP-sialic acid synthesis and for sialyltransferases with specificities similar to those in mammals have been introduced with plasmids or integrated into the genome of host bacteria cells, enabling the production of sialylated N- and O-glycoproteins.

The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe's disease. The replacement therapies clearly have beneficial effects and prolong life but are extremely expensive. A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).""
 ""In use now for many years, the added enzyme consistently improves patients’ clinical features with minimal side effects. The cost of treatment is high, and high doses are no more effective than lower doses for improving visceral and hematological pathologies. The proven effectiveness makes glucocerebrosidase the favorite therapy for these patients, but terminal mannose residues cannot be used to target the enzyme to other cells or organs or to enable treatment of other lysosomal storage disorders. Insufficient infused enzyme crosses the blood–brain barrier thus, the enzyme (Cerezyme) works very well for type I disease without neurological involvement but not for the less common Gaucher's with neurological involvement. In addition, patients sometimes develop antibodies against the injected human protein. ERT trials with other recombinant lysosomal enzymes have progressed. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II, IVA, and VI and is under development for others.""
 ""Another approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders is enzyme replacement therapy. Unlike most therapeutic glycoproteins that interact with target receptors on the surface of cells, lysosomal enzymes developed for replacement therapy must be delivered intracellularly to lysosomes, their site of action. During the normal biosynthesis of lysosomal enzymes, their N-glycans become modified with mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues, which target them to lysosomes using Man-6-P receptors (see Chapter 30). The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease targets the lysosomes of macrophages via the cell-surface mannose receptor (see Chapter 31).""
 'Combination therapy using ERT and a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize the therapeutic enzyme in the bloodstream is being considered. Recombinant α-galactosidase for Fabry disease works well and recombinant α-L-iduronidase for MPS I works very well with the intermediate severity form (Hurler–Scheie), but its effect is unclear for patients with the more common neurological form (Hurler syndrome). HSCT, presumably providing α-L-iduronidase in CNS from the donor-derived microglia, is effective to MPS I. Recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B; Naglazyme) was approved for MPS VI, as was α-glucosidase (Myozyme) for treating Pompe disease patients. Iduronic acid-2-sulfatase (Elaprase) is approved for treating Hunter syndrome. These results clearly validate this approach.'
 ""The overall increase in activity is small, but it can have significant clinical benefits. Clinical trials are in progress for treating Fabry disease, Gaucher type I, and Pompe disease, whereas preclinical trials are being performed for GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis. A potential problem is that some inhibitors may not cross the blood–brain barrier, limiting their effectiveness in the central nervous system (CNS). The advent of high-throughput screening methods and large chemical libraries increase the potential of this approach. In addition, allosteric site binders can be selected that remain bound to the enzyme, and any successful compound could be used in combination with ERT to further enhance activity. ERT has been quite successful for treating Gaucher's disease. Injection of glucocerebrosidase carrying mannose-terminated N-glycans targets the enzyme to the macrophage/monocytes, which are the primary sites of substrate accumulation. In use now for many years, the added enzyme consistently improves patients’ clinical features with minimal side effects.""
 'Enzyme replacement therapy has been successful in treating Gaucher disease, and drugs to block GlcCer synthesis (“substrate reduction therapy”) are in clinical use (Chapter 55). Another example, Tay–Sachs disease, is caused by mutations in a β-hexosaminidase and results in the buildup of GM2, culminating in irreversible fatal deterioration of brain function. Unfortunately, enzyme replacement delivery to the brain has not yet been successfully developed, which is also a problem for long-term treatment of Gaucher disease. Glycosphingolipid storage and related diseases are considered more extensively in Chapter 44. Anti-GSL antibodies are involved in certain autoimmune diseases (Chapter 46). Some forms of Guillain–Barré syndrome, the most common form of paralytic disease worldwide, clearly involve autoantibodies against gangliosides. One form of Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs subsequent to infection with particular strains of the common diarrheal bacterial agent Campylobacter jejuni.'
 'As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme. Some of these enzymes that are targeted to lysosomes via the M6P pathway have been prepared in large quantities as recombinant soluble proteins and used in enzyme replacement therapy. To date, the benefits have been variable but less than optimal. There are a number of potential reasons for this. First, some of the preparations may not contain the physiologic complement of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker. It is reasonable to suggest that a greater M6P content may improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement in these patients. This has been shown to be the case in mouse and dog model systems. However, even with fully phosphorylated enzymes there may be obstacles that are difficult to overcome. For example, some cell types in the body may not express adequate levels of the CI-MPR on their surfaces to endocytose sufficient enzyme to restore normal lysosomal function.']","The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate.

The four recombinant enzyme products imiglucerase (approved in 1995), velaglucerase (approved in 2010), taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso, approved in 2012), and eliglustat (Cerdelga, approved in 2014) are marketed to treat Gaucher's disease. The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe's disease.","The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe's disease. The replacement therapies clearly have beneficial effects and prolong life but are extremely expensive. A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Low-molecular-weight competitive inhibitors of some of these enzymes can act as “chaperones,” which stabilize the folded enzyme in the ER and effectively rescue the mutation and increase the steady state concentration of active enzyme in the lysosome. The dose of the inhibitor must be carefully adjusted to ensure that the inhibitory effects on enzyme function do not overshadow beneficial effects on folding. Only a low level of enzyme restoration is needed to significantly reduce the accumulation of undigested glycan substrates, indicating that lysosomal hydrolases are normally present in large catalytic excess.",1.0,0.630163168628794,0.7745320213848574,0.06521739130434782,0.733333333315,0.75

Nature enhances specificity by utilizing multivalent interactions. The number and the presentation of carbohydrate residues on a biomolecule are major determinants of binding avidity of ligands to cell-surface receptors. The transition from monovalent to multivalent is often associated with a larger variation in affinity/avidity, suggesting a “thresholding” effect, and in some cases cooperativity. To elucidate those mechanisms, glycans have to be displayed in a scenario closer to that found on the cellular scale. “Nanotechnology” moves from the angstrom to the nanometer range (from ∼10−10 to ∼10−7 m), offering the tools to create, manipulate, and characterize structures on those scales. Large glycoconjugates bearing multiple copies of a carbohydrate on various scaffolds, such as glycodendrimers or glycopolymers, have been generated to probe carbohydrate–protein interactions.'
 'Given the central role of multivalency in glycobiology, glycosylated nanomaterials are interesting probes to study cellular, tissue, and organismal interactions. Nanomaterials purely composed of glycans, such as polysaccharide nanoparticles or nanocrystals, are interesting imaging agents, drug delivery systems, and tissue scaffolds that illustrate the potential of glycans in nanotechnology. Glycoproteins and glycolipids are natural glycoconjugates that take part in cellular communication, inflammation, and immune response using carbohydrate–protein or carbohydrate–carbohydrate interactions. Certain glycan sequences are characteristic markers of diseases such as cancer, asthma, and diabetes. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms requires tools that mimic the presentation of glycans on the cell surface. Individual protein–carbohydrate interactions are often of low affinity and broad specificity, complicating the description of glycan function. Nature enhances specificity by utilizing multivalent interactions.'
 'Carbohydrate–carbohydrate interactions can also have specific biological roles. A classic example is the species-specific interaction between marine sponges, mediated via homotypic binding of glycans on a large cell-surface glycoprotein, perhaps indicating the critical importance of glycosylation for the evolution of multicellularity. Another example is the compaction of the mouse embryo at the morula stage, which seems to be facilitated by a Lewis x–Lewis x interaction. The single-site affinities of such interactions are often weak and thus difficult to measure. However, if the molecules are present in very high copy numbers, a large number of relatively low-affinity interactions can collaborate to produce a high-avidity “Velcro” effect that is sufficient to mediate biologically relevant interactions. Glycosylation can also modulate interactions of proteins with one another. Some growth factor receptors acquire their binding abilities in a glycosylation-dependent manner while in transit through the Golgi apparatus.'
 'Protein subunits are shown as gray surfaces and glycans are shown as ball and sticks (PDB entry 5FUU). Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other.'
 'Intrinsically low site affinity can sometimes be overcome using a multivalent form of the cognate glycan. Finally, especially when studying complex multicellular systems, introduced glycans could be cross-recognized by other known or unknown binding proteins, giving a confusing phenotypic readout. A powerful approach is the use of degradative enzymes known to be highly specific for a particular glycan sequence. Many such specific enzymes can be obtained from microbial pathogens. The advantage of this approach lies in eliminating certain structures selectively after normal synthesis has been completed rather than interfering with the biosynthetic cellular machinery. Thus, for example, sialidase treatment abolished lymphocyte binding to the high endothelial venules of lymph nodes and provided the first indication of endogenous ligands for L-selectin (Chapter 32); injection of endoneuraminidase into the developing retina suggested specific roles for polySias (Chapter 15); and injection of heparanase into developing embryos gave randomization of left–right axis formation (Chapter 17).'
 'Their relative activities, combined with cellular location, are essential to the proper balance of these processes and any alteration, including genetic mutation, can lead to disease in humans. Pathogens also depend on similar processes, and understanding such mechanisms can facilitate the design of selective inhibitors of pathogen enzymes. This is another area in which molecular docking can play a role. Structural studies of glycan–protein complexes usually require a stable system—not one that would continually convert substrates to products. Molecular docking can provide useful depictions of these reactive systems. A good example involves the glycosyltranferase, ST6Gal1. This is the enzyme that adds a sialic acid (typically Neu5Ac) to the galactose terminated branches of N-glycans by transferring Neu5Ac from its nucleotide-sugar donor, CMP-Neu5Ac, to an acceptor terminated with a Galβ1-4GlcNAc moiety (Chapter 6).'
 'As emphasized in previous chapters, the numbers of distinct glycans produced by various organisms are enormous, but at the same time, glycans lack the diversity in functional groups displayed by other molecules. To achieve specificity in glycan recognition, proteins rely as much on the stereospecific placement of glycan hydroxyl groups at chiral centers, use of different linkage sites, and extensive branching as they rely on specific modifications of hydroxyl groups by processes such as sulfation, phosphorylation, and esterification. This puts placement of various residues and functional groups in three dimensions at a premium. Building a three-dimensional picture of how recognition of glycans by proteins occurs is therefore essential if we are to understand how glycans are synthesized and recognized in the many physiological and pathological processes they control. It is also essential if we are to use knowledge of glycan recognition as a basis for the production of therapeutic agents that can control these processes in the event of disease. Building a structure depicting glycan recognition is not without its challenges.']","To address the challenges posed by the low affinity and broad specificity of individual protein-carbohydrate interactions, nature employs multivalent interactions to enhance specificity. This transition from monovalent to multivalent interactions can lead to a larger variation in affinity/avidity, indicating a ""thresholding"" effect and potential cooperativity. By displaying glycans in a scenario closer to their presentation on the cellular scale, researchers can better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying glycan function and interactions with proteins. Multivalency plays a central role in glycobiology, offering insights into cellular, tissue, and organismal interactions, and highlighting the importance of studying glycan-decorated nanomaterials to understand biological processes.","The number and the presentation of carbohydrate residues on a biomolecule are major determinants of binding avidity of ligands to cell-surface receptors.

This gives rise to glycopolymers with architectures resembling those of glycoproteins or proteoglycans.

Nanomaterials from plants and crustacean shells offer new materials for the development of biorenewable and biocompatible products. These nano-sized particles, consisting of bundled polymer chains, have properties and function that are different from the isolated polymer chains from which they are made.'
 'Structural polymers also exist; for example, the repeating polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, -[4GlcNAcβ1-]n, is the primary component of chitin, the material that forms the exoskeletons of arachnids, crustaceans, and insects (Chapter 26). Modifications of glucose residues by replacing the hydroxyl group at 2-position with an amine group and subsequent N-acetylation change the structural properties significantly. These changes allow for the formation of composites with proteins and minerals that lead to additional variation in structure and function. Most cell-surface polysaccharides found in animals belong to a class of glycans known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Chapter 17). Abundantly present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix, GAGs are linear macromolecules with molecular mass of >15,000 Da.'
 'The polysaccharide may also be decorated by substituents such as amino acids, O-acyl, or phosphodiester groups. It is not uncommon to find O-acetyl groups at the branch-point sugar residue, thereby leading to a highly crowded substitution pattern in which all positions on the sugar residue are either part of a glycosidic linkage or carry a nonsugar substituent. Examples of diversity by substituent addition are the O-antigens of Shigella flexneri in which glucosyl, O-acetyl, or phosphoethanolamine groups are added to the backbone (Figure 3.4E). Branching and substituent addition affect the properties of polysaccharide solutions, such as gelling and high viscosity. Some polymers are known under their commercial names gellan, welan, and rhamsan (S-194) (Figure 3.4F).'
 ""With society's ongoing need for polymers with new properties and functions, there is increased effort to develop chemical or biocatalytic reaction pathways to modify the structure of a polysaccharide backbone or side chains to enable the production of polysaccharide derivatives with enhanced or new properties. Cellulose is one example of a plant polysaccharide that has been extensively modified to develop new biosourced polymers. Reaction pathways have been developed to generate specific cellulose derivatives by substituting accessible hydroxyl groups with other chemical groups. Such derivatives include cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrates, carboxymethyl cellulose, and cellulose butyrate succinate. These products are used in many industrial applications as coatings, inks, binders, and thickening/gelling agents. They are also used in the pharmaceutical industries to produce controlled-release drug tablets and in the cosmetics and food industries as thickening and gelling agents.""
 'Pectins are some of the most complex polymers in nature. They are based on polymers of α(1-4)-linked galacturonic acid (GalA) or the RU, -2)-α-L-Rha-(1-4)-α-D-GalA-(1-, and may contain additional sugar and nonsugar substituents, including methyl and acetyl esters. The negatively charged carboxyl group at the 6-position of the GalA residues contributes to the water solubility of these polymers and the long-range interactions that give them gelling properties useful in the food industry. Oligo- and polysaccharides of plant origin are discussed in detail in Chapter 24. Animals also use polysaccharides for various purposes. Glycogen is a storage polymer related to starch in that it is a glucose polymer with primarily α(1-4)-linkages connecting glucose residues, but it is highly branched having additional α(1-6)-linkages to some of the glucose residues.'
 'When two sugar residues alternate, branched structures can be formed, as one sugar may give rise to the polymer backbone and one a side chain. Polysaccharides are not always built from the nonreducing end, and preformed subunits can be used in the assembly. For example, synthesis of the E. coli antigens O5ab and O5ac relies on a preformed linear oligosaccharide, with five sugar residues constituting the RU. The oligosaccharide is built on an undecaprenyl pyrophosphoryl glycoside anchor molecule. This oligosaccharide is then added onto another oligosaccharide–lipid anchor to grow the polymer from the “reducing end.” When polymerization is taking place at the penultimate sugar of the oligosaccharide a branched RU results (cf. O-antigen of E. coli O168 [Figure 3.4C]). Branching can be introduced by the addition of sugars following polymer backbone formation.'
 'The variation in biosynthetic pathways among bacterial species is ultimately responsible for the diversity in bacterial polysaccharides. The biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides is discussed further in Chapter 21. Here the authors present a few examples to illustrate how synthesis of backbone structures, branching, and postpolymerization modification lead to a diverse set of polymer structures. In one of the biosynthetic pathways, sugar residues are added sequentially onto an anchor molecule; thus, the polymer is growing from the terminal, nonreducing end until a termination entity/substituent is added that precludes further chain elongation—for example, in the O-antigen polysaccharide of the LPS from Escherichia coli O8 (Figure 3.4A). The polymer is linear, and although sugar residues are added step-by-step to form the polysaccharide, RUs can be identified.']",This process of covalently appending synthetic or naturally derived oligosaccharides to polymer chains built from petroleum-based monomers results in the formation of glycopolymers with architectures that mimic those of glycoproteins or proteoglycans.,"Such materials have found increasing use as research tools to study the biological functions of glycans and are currently explored as biomaterials for drug delivery or as antifouling and antifreeze agents. Nanomaterials from plants and crustacean shells offer new materials for the development of biorenewable and biocompatible products. These nano-sized particles, consisting of bundled polymer chains, have properties and function that are different from the isolated polymer chains from which they are made. Such nanomaterials can be produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, chitin and chitosan. A more focused description is given below on nanomaterials from cellulose. Polysaccharides that have little or no branching of their backbone can self-assemble to form ordered structures in which the individual polymer chains stack along the chain axis, thus forming a crystalline structure. Cellulose is one example of a plant polysaccharide that has this type of crystalline structure. During cellulose biosynthesis individual glucan chains assemble to form microfibril structures that contain both crystalline and disordered arrangements (see Figure 59.1A). The high mechanical stiffness and tensile strength along the length of the cellulose microfibrils provide high mechanical strength, high strength-to-weight ratio, and toughness to plant tissues and organs.",1.0,0.6729551467314776,0.5920363017088195,0.05,0.16666666665,0.5

 'In addition, simple, rapidly turning over, protein-bound glycans are abundant within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in which they can serve as regulatory switches. A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids). In analogy to the current situation in Cosmology, glycans can be considered as the “dark matter” of the biological universe: a major and critical component that has yet to be fully incorporated into the “standard model” of biology. However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities.'
 'Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states.

 'The major glycan classes discussed in the book are described, and an overview of the general pathways for their biosynthesis is provided. Topological issues relevant to biosynthesis and functions of glycoconjugates are also considered, and the growing role of these molecules in medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioenergy, and materials science is mentioned. Defined in the broadest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (also called carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature and of the proteins that recognize them. How does glycobiology fit into the modern concepts of molecular biology? The central paradigm driving research in molecular biology has been that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The power of this concept lies in its template-based precision, the ability to manipulate one class of molecules based on knowledge of another, and the patterns of sequence homology and relatedness that predict function and reveal evolutionary relationships.'
 'Although not traditionally considered part of “Glycobiology,” many natural and synthetic glycans are key components of Nanotechnology, Bioenergy, and Material Science. Glyconanomaterials (Chapter 58) have tunable chemical and physical properties and can be built on different scaffolds to probe cellular, tissue, and organismal interactions. Attached glycans can change nanomaterial properties, optimizing solubility and biocompatibility and lowering cytotoxicity. Glyconanomaterials have been used as imaging agents, spectroscopic tools, monitors of cellular systems, and vehicles for vaccination and drug delivery. Plant glycans are used for many purposes: energy sources, building materials, clothes, paper products, animal feed, and food and beverage additives (Chapter 59). Concerns about detrimental environmental effects and diminishing reserves of petroleum and its by-products have greatly renewed interest in using plant glycans for energy production, generation of polymers with improved or new functionalities, and as sources of high-value chemosynthetic precursors (Chapter 59).'
 '), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates. The advancement of glycoscience as a discipline depends on expanding the integration of data describing glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, lipopolysaccharides, and the genome-coded enzymatic machinery that generates or breaks down these glycans, together with the ever-increasing information about the interactions of these glycoconjugates with other components of the cell. It is the ultimate goal of glycoscience research to be able to link glycan structures with their function.'
 'The specialized glycans expressed by parasites and microbes that are of great interest from the biomedical point of view (Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 43) may themselves be subject to evolutionary selection pressures. These issues are further considered in Chapter 20, which also discusses the limited information concerning how various glycan biosynthetic pathways appear to have evolved and diverged in different life-forms. Numerous natural bioactive molecules are glycoconjugates, and the attached glycans can have dramatic effects on the biosynthesis, stability, action, and turnover of these molecules in intact organisms. For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology.']","Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states.

Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies.",1.0,0.5846767352529204,0.7776236217868271,0.02564102564102564,0.9999999999857143,0.75
How were CD33 Siglecs identified?,"['CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia. It has two Ig domains and was the first of the CD33rSiglecs to be characterized as an inhibitory receptor, suppressing activation of FcγRI and recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Figure 35.5). CD33 has some preference for α2-6- rather than α2-3-sialylated glycans and binds strongly to sialylated ligands on myeloid leukemia cell lines. The restricted expression of CD33 has been exploited in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia using gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody coupled to the toxic antibiotic calicheamicin. Binding of anti-CD33 mAbs to CD33 triggers endocytosis of the bound antibody.'
 ""Binding of anti-CD33 mAbs to CD33 triggers endocytosis of the bound antibody. This depends on ITIM phosphorylation, recruitment of the E3 ligase Cbl, and ubiquitylation of the CD33 cytoplasmic tail. Selective expression of CD33 on leukemic progenitor cells also makes it an attractive target for therapy using chimeric antigen receptors expressed on cytotoxic T cells. Proposed biological functions mediated by CD33-related Siglecs. A generic CD33-related Siglec is represented, showing the location of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the potential for inhibitory signaling.  Recently, two coinherited single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with protection of humans against late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These SNPs result in increased exon 2 skipping, leading to raised levels of CD33 lacking the V-set domain and reduced levels of full-length CD33.""
 'Overall, it appears that this class of SIGLEC genes is subject to multiple “Red Queen” effects in evolution, in which evolutionary changes of sialyltransferases in response to the emergence of Sia-binding pathogens may lead to subsequent evolutionary changes of Siglec specificities (Figure 35.4). Probable evolutionary chain of Red Queen effects involving Sias and CD33rSiglecs. See text for discussion. (Redrawn, with permission, from Padler-Karavani V, et al. 2014. FASEB J 28: 1280–1293.) To limit further complexity, two additional Red (more...) Below, we provide a brief summary of the main features of the human CD33rSiglecs and, where relevant, their murine counterparts. CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia.'
 'Furthermore, mouse CD33 has a lysine residue in the transmembrane sequence and couples to the DAP12 transmembrane adaptor, as shown for mouse Siglec-H and human Siglecs-14, -15, and -16. In contrast to human CD33, mouse CD33 in the blood is expressed mainly on neutrophils rather than monocytes, and at low levels in microglia, which also suggests a nonconserved function of this receptor. The SIGLEC5 and SIGLEC14 genes are adjacent to each other on chromosome 19 and encode proteins containing four and three Ig-like domains, respectively. Because of ongoing gene conversions within most taxa, the first two Ig domains of Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 share >99% sequence identity but then diverge, with Siglec-5 being an inhibitory receptor with typical ITIMs, whereas Siglec-14 can complex with DAP12 and activate signaling.'
 'The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs. Siglecs are divided into two major subgroups based on sequence similarity (Figure 35.1) and on conservation among mammalian species. The first group comprises Sn (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), MAG (Siglec-4), and Siglec-15, for which there are clear-cut orthologs in all mammalian species examined and which share only ∼25%–30% sequence identity among each other.'
 'A second reason is that the Sia-binding V-set domains of the CD33rSiglecs are rapidly evolving, presumably to adjust their binding specificity to the rapid evolution of the endogenous host sialome, as well as evasion of binding by pathogens via molecular mimicry (Chapter 15) or specific protein-mediated interactions (see below). There are also multiple gene conversion events between adjacent genes and pseudogenes within this cluster. Of interest is the finding that humans show many CD33rSiglec differences compared with our closest evolutionary cousins (the chimpanzees), more than the differences between mice and rats, which shared a common ancestor much earlier (see below). As mentioned earlier, an “essential” arginine residue in all known Siglecs is required for binding Sia-containing ligands. This residue is often mutated in nature, resulting in loss of binding ability.'
 'Siglec-15 therefore provides a novel target for diseases, such as menopause-related osteoporosis and cancer. Genes encoding most of the CD33rSiglec subfamily are clustered on human chromosome 19q13.3-13.4 or the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7. They include CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglecs-5 through -12, Siglec-14, and Siglec-16 in humans and CD33 and Siglecs-E, -F, -G, and -H in mice. Similar clusters are found in other mammals. It is difficult to assign all definitive orthologs between primates and rodents, resulting in different nomenclatures. One reason is that most IgSF domains are encoded by exons with phase-1 splice junctions, allowing exon shuffling without disrupting open reading frames, resulting in hybrid genes that are difficult to distinguish from similarly organized genes in other species.']","CD33 Siglecs were identified as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed for the in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.","Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans. The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins. However, it became clear that these four Sia-binding molecules were a distinct subgroup sharing both sequence homology and Ig-domain organization, and that they were not all involved in adhesion. The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.",1.0,0.999999497965182,0.5933059019858599,0.05405405405405406,0.9999999999857143,0.75
What degree of polymerization is necessary for oligosaccharins to trigger plant defense?,"['Oligosaccharins that are active in plants. Examples of oligosaccharides derived from fungal, oomycete, and plant cell walls are shown. The degree of polymerization (DP) of the minimally active oligosaccharide structures triggering some responses in plants (more...) The composition (monosaccharide units), degree of polymerization (DP), and branching of the oligosaccharins determine their biological activity in triggering plant defense. For example, oligogalacturonides that are biologically active typically require a DP of 10–14 for activity, whereas DPs of >7 and >4 are necessary for the oligochitosans and oligochitins, respectively (Figure 40.2). A single active hepta-glucoside from oomycete walls was isolated from a mixture of approximately 300 inactive structural isomers and found to trigger defense responses in soybean.'
 'A single active hepta-glucoside from oomycete walls was isolated from a mixture of approximately 300 inactive structural isomers and found to trigger defense responses in soybean. Both the DP and location of the β-1-3 branches in this oligosaccharide are important for its biological activity (Figure 40.2). Elongating the oligosaccharide at the reducing end had no discernible effect on bioactivity and activity was also largely retained by removal of a single glucose from the reducing end. However, the hexa-glucoside was the minimal structure of this oligosaccharide that had appreciable activity in inducing defense responses in soybean. The low quantities and different types of glycan signal molecules that elicit defense responses suggest that these glycans are recognized by specific plasma membrane-localized receptors. A 75-kDa plasma membrane protein with high-binding affinity for chitin elicitors was identified in rice cell plasma membranes and proposed to be involved in oligosaccharide perception and signal transduction.'
 'Other pathogen-derived oligosaccharins are the PAMPs derived from linear homo-oligomers from fungal/oomycete cell walls that include chitin [1,4-β-D-(GlcNAc)n], and its deacetylated form (chitosan), and β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2). More recently, additional plant cell wall–derived oligosaccharins have been shown to trigger defense responses, including cellulose-derived oligomers (β-1,4-glucans), mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs: β-1,4/β-1,3 glucans), and oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucans, mannans, xylans, or callose, which trigger signaling cascades in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including crops (Figure 40.2).'
 ""Oligogalacturonides composed of 1-4-linked α-GalA residues are one example of oligosaccharins released from plant cell wall polysaccharides, in this specific case from homogalacturonans by endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) secreted by the pathogen. The activities of such pathogen-derived EPGs are frequently inhibited or modulated by polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIP) produced by plants. Similarly, oligoglucosides composed of 1-6- and 1-3-linked β-Glc residues released from the mycelial walls of the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae by plant endo-glucanases were an early example of oligosaccharins generated from a pathogen's cell wall.""
 'It has recently been shown that at least some “self” immune-active plant glycans are released in a regulated manner as part of normal plant developmental pathways and are not necessarily tied to cell-wall damage pathways (see below). It is also noteworthy that some immune-active oligosaccharides can be released from polymers present in the walls of both the pathogen and the plant. For example, β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides are released from callose, which is produced by plants and is also a component of many fungal and oomycete cell walls. Similarly, β-1,4-glucan oligosaccharides are released from cellulose that is present in the cell walls of plants and some oomycetes. Oligosaccharins that are active in plants. Examples of oligosaccharides derived from fungal, oomycete, and plant cell walls are shown.'
 ""Many of these effects may result from the ability of oligogalacturonides to alter the plant's responses to the hormone auxin. Oligogalacturonide receptor proteins (WAKs) have been reported to bind to cell wall pectin and thereby affect plant cell expansion. Auxin-induced elongation of pea stem segments is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of a nonasaccharide-rich fragment of xyloglucan (Figure 40.2). Plants may also use endogenous Nod-factor-like signals to regulate their growth and development. Recent work on plants with altered lignin structure/composition suggests that plants have the ability to monitor changes in the structures of their walls and to trigger responses distinct from those involved in plant defense. In this case, the released active oligosaccharides appear to be fragments of rhamnogalacturonans, which are distinct from the oligogalacturonides involved in plant defense.""
 'Xyloglucan oligosaccharides effectively protected grapevine and Arabidopsis against the fungal/oomycete pathogens, whereas β-1,3-glucans improved, among others, tobacco, and grapevine protection against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens. Given the high abundance of β-1,3-glucans in brown seaweed, laminarin-based products have been successfully developed for use in agriculture as activators of plant natural defense against pathogens. Similarly, pretreatments with cellobiose reduced growth of some pathogens on Arabidopsis seedlings, although high doses were required to observe such effects. In all of these cases, PRRs involved in the perception of these oligosaccharide structures that are active in generating these resistance responses in plants have not yet been characterized in detail. The examples given in this chapter indicate the diversity of free glycan structures that can function as signaling molecules.']","Oligogalacturonides that are biologically active typically require a degree of polymerization (DP) of 10–14 for activity, whereas DPs of >7 and >4 are necessary for the oligochitosans and oligochitins, respectively.","The composition (monosaccharide units), degree of polymerization (DP), and branching of the oligosaccharins determine their biological activity in triggering plant defense.

What do glycosyltransferases do?,"['The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide.'
 'The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10).'
 'Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety. The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways.'
 'In this case, removal of the N-acetylglucosamine moiety by the glycosidase, O-GlcNAcase, provides a means of dynamically regulating the extent of O-GlcNAcylation and the diverse processes that it mediates. Glycosyltransferases catalyze their reactions with either inversion or retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon atom of the donor substrate (Figure 6.5). For example, β1-4 galactosyltransferase, an inverting glycosyltransferase, transfers galactose from UDP-α-Gal to generate a β1-4-linked galactose-containing product. Inversion of stereochemistry follows from the fact that the enzyme uses an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction mechanism in which an acceptor hydroxyl group attacks the anomeric carbon atom of UDP-Gal from one side and UDP leaves from the other (Figure 6.5A).'
 'Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another.'
 'Is it more like solution chemistry or like solid-state transfers? Are there really “soluble pools” of nucleotide sugars? Dramatic time-lapse videos of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged glycosyltransferases show that the proteins are highly mobile within the Golgi, but there is also physical evidence for multiglycosyltransferase complexes involved in the biosynthesis of N-linked glycans, glycosphingolipids, and heparan sulfate. Many transporters appear to function as homodimers, and the GDP-Man transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (VRG4) oligomerizes in the ER and appears to be transported to the Golgi by an active process. Also, synthesis of galactosylceramide occurs in the ER and a portion of the UDP-Gal transporter binds specifically to galactosylceramide synthase and is retained in the ER to provide donor substrate (Chapter 11).'
 'The catalytic domain is related to a large number of plant Golgi glycosyltransferases implicated in pectin biosynthesis and here catalyzes two successive additions. In contrast, most protists employ separate glycosyltransferases with independent evolutionary origins to catalyze the completion of the glycan (Figure 18.2A). In Toxoplasma and Pythium ultimum, a crop plant pathogen and agent for human pythiosus, addition of the αGlc residue is carried out by a CAZy GT31 enzyme most related to Golgi glycosyltransferases that extend mannose chains in yeast, and the terminal αGal residue is added by Gat1, a CAZy GT8 enzyme that is most related to the enzyme discussed below, glycogenin. Finally, in other protists, gene fusions consolidate the first two or final two enzymes as separate domains of the same protein (Figure 18.2C), which may facilitate efficient extension of the glycan to its final length.']","Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar molecules to various acceptor substrates, such as proteins, lipids, and other molecules, to initiate or elongate glycan chains in glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. These enzymes play a crucial role in shaping the diversity of natural glycans by regulating regioselectivity, stereochemistry, and the composition of glycan structures.",Glycosyltransferases assemble monosaccharides into linear and branched glycan chains,1.0,0.7141485350639948,0.7085483515284299,0.1111111111111111,0.9999999999857143,1.0
What do glycosidases do?,"['Exoglycosidases cleave the glycosidic linkage of terminal sugars from the nonreducing end of glycans (the outermost left end of glycans for figures in this book, e.g., Figure 44.1). Exoglycosidases recognize only one monosaccharide (rarely two) in a specific anomeric linkage and are much less particular about the structure of the molecule beyond that glycosidic linkage. This lack of specificity allows these enzymes to act on a broad range of substrates. However, exoglycosidases do not usually work unless all of the hydroxyl groups of the terminal sugar are unmodified. Acetate, sulfate, or phosphate groups usually have to be removed before action of the glycosidases. Esterases cleave acetyl groups and specific sulfatases remove the sulfate groups on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N- or O-linked glycans.'
 'Unlike the glycosyltransferases, members of this family have evolved independently many times, a fact reflected in the diverse array of three-dimensional structures observed for these enzymes. Glycosidases play important roles in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars and for the turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes. Glycosidases are also involved in the formation of intermediates that are used as substrates for glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of glycans. The use of glycosidases in this way is particularly important in the biosynthesis of N-glycan-containing glycoproteins in more evolutionarily advanced eukaryotes and is thought to be associated with the acquisition of complex N-glycans during the evolution of multicellular organisms.'
 'In contrast to glycosyltransferase-mediated reactions, in which the equilibrium is shifted predominantly to (natural) product formation because of the intrinsic reactivity of donor glycosides, the equilibrium in a glycosidase-mediated reaction can be influenced such that the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction. Under physiological conditions, with high water concentrations, glycosidases hydrolyze glycosidic linkages to produce the corresponding hemiacetal, either with retention (Figure 54.5A) or inversion of configuration at the anomeric center. Performing a glycosidase reaction in partly nonaqueous conditions, by addition of large excess of aglycon, by inducing kinetic conditions or by a combination of these allows for partial reversal of the reaction equilibrium. By this means and in a “transglycosylation” event, glycans can be constructed.'
 'By this means and in a “transglycosylation” event, glycans can be constructed. Disadvantages of this method are that reaction conditions may be adverse to enzyme reactivity and/or stability and, moreover, that the formed product is in essence a substrate for glycosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis. This caveat can be circumvented by making use of mutant glycosidases (Figure 54.5B) in which the catalytic nucleophile in case of retaining glycosidases is mutated to an innocent bystander (depicted is an Asp to Ala substitution). Such a “glycosynthase” can be used to react a synthetic donor glycoside that bears the anomeric configuration corresponding to the intermediate enzyme glycosyl covalent adduct (see Figure 54.1) with an appropriate nucleophile to construct a desired glycosidic linkage.'
 'Loss-of-function mutations in the FGE gene lead to inactive sulfatases. This deficit affects GAG degradation and any other sulfated glycan such as sulfatides. Glycosphingolipids (Chapter 11) are degraded from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases while they are still bound to the lipid moiety ceramide. Because glycosphingolipids share some of the same outer sugar sequences found in N- and O-glycans (Chapter 14), many of the same glycosidases are used for their degradation (Figure 44.4). However, specific hydrolases cleave the glucose–ceramide and galactose–ceramide bonds. Besides specific enzymes, noncatalytic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) help to present the lipid substrates to enzymes for cleavage.'
 'Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water.'
 'Esterases cleave acetyl groups and specific sulfatases remove the sulfate groups on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N- or O-linked glycans. Endoglycosidases cleave internal glycosidic linkages of larger chains. These enzymes are often more tolerant of modifications of the glycan; in some cases, they require a modified sugar for optimal cleavage. Degradation of complex-type N-glycans. The lysosomal degradation pathway of glycoproteins carrying complex-type glycans proceeds simultaneously on both the protein and glycan moieties. The N-glycans are sequentially degraded by the indicated exoglycosidases (more...) Even though the lysosomal glycosidases perform similar reactions, their amino acid sequences are only ∼15%–20% identical to each other. Thus, there are no highly conserved glycosidase catalytic domains.']","Glycosidases play important roles in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars, turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes, and formation of intermediates used as substrates for glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of glycans.

What donor substrates do glycosyltranferases transfer monosaccharides from?,"['In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22).'
 'This is usually sufficient to reach or exceed the calculated Km of glycosyltransferases that use these donors. Some known transporters for nucleotide sugars, PAPS (3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate), and ATP are located in the Golgi membranes of mammals, yeast, protozoa, and plants. These proteins are antiporters and return the corresponding (more...) Most of these antiporters are found in the Golgi, but some are also found in the ER. They are organelle-specific and their location usually corresponds to the location of the relevant glycosyltransferases (Table 5.2; Figure 5.4). Nucleotide sugar import into the Golgi is not energy-dependent nor affected by ionophores. However, the import is competitively inhibited by the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and diphosphates in the cytosol but not by the monosaccharides.'
 'Iduronic acid does not have a nucleotide sugar parent because it is formed by epimerization of glucuronic acid after it is incorporated into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In some instances, one nucleotide sugar can be formed from another either by direct epimerization (reaction 2 above) or by a nucleotide exchange reaction (reaction 3 above). For example, UDP-Gal is made from UDP-Glc by exchange of Gal-1-P for Glc-1-P. Activated sugar donors in animal cells  Three types of sugar transporters carry sugars across the plasma membrane into cells. First are energy-independent facilitated diffusion transporters, such as the glucose transporter (GLUT) family of hexose transporters found in yeast and most mammalian cells. The genes encoding these proteins are named SLC2A (solute carriers 2A).'
 'This is probably because the galactosyltransferases that synthesize the core region tetrasaccharide common to GAG chains have lower Km values for their donors (Chapter 17). Many putative transporters were identified by homology in the genomes of mammals, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, plants, and yeast. Like the plasma membrane GLUT transporters discussed above, all are multimembrane-spanning (type III) proteins, but the level of amino acid identity does not give any clue to the substrate specificity. The UDP-GlcNAc transporters from mammalian cells and yeast are 22% identical, whereas mammalian CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GlcNAc transporters have 40%–50% identity. Clever domain-swapping experiments show that distinct regions are responsible for functional transport, and engineered chimeric transporters can carry both CMP-Sia and UDP-Gal.'
 'Monosaccharide precursors are imported into the cell, salvaged from degraded glycans, or created enzymatically from other sugars within the cell. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation occurs mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, whereas monosaccharide activation and interconversions occur mostly in the cytoplasm. Nucleotide sugar–specific transporters carry activated sugar donors into the Golgi and to a lesser extent into the ER. In some cases, nucleotide sugars are used to synthesize activated lipid-linked intermediates before glycan transfer. This chapter describes how cells accomplish these tasks, with an emphasis on animal cells. Glucose and fructose are the major carbon and energy sources for organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Most organisms can synthesize the other monosaccharides needed for glycan biosynthesis from these sources. Not all of these biosynthetic pathways are equally active in all types of cells. However, there are some general principles.'
 'Negative charge prevents these donors from simply diffusing into these compartments. To overcome this hurdle, eukaryotic cells have a set of energy-independent nucleotide sugar antiporters that deliver nucleotide sugars into the lumen of these organelles, with the simultaneous exiting of nucleoside monophosphates, most of which must first be generated from the nucleoside diphosphates by a nucleoside diphosphatase (Figure 5.4). This transport mechanism was determined biochemically in isolated vesicles and genetically in various mutant cell lines. The Km of the transporters ranges from 1 to 10 µm. Using in vitro systems, the transporters have been shown to increase the concentration of the nucleotide sugars within the Golgi lumen by 10- to 50-fold. This is usually sufficient to reach or exceed the calculated Km of glycosyltransferases that use these donors.'
 'Most monosaccharides that reach the cytoplasm are activated and reused, as described below. However, the uronic acids cannot be reused in animals and are degraded via the pentose phosphate pathway.

Glycan salvage pathways are clinically exploited to mitigate the impact of certain rare congenital disorders of glycosylation that target sugar biosynthesis or transport (Chapter 45). Experimentally, salvage pathways are used to manipulate nucleotide sugar pools, to incorporate glycans with biorthogonal chemical handles (Chapter 56), and to generate metabolic glycosyltransferase inhibitors (Chapter 55).

Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively.

 'Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism.

These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases.'
 'The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide.'
 'The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10).'
 'This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose.'
 'The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17).

 'Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center. The mechanisms employed by most Leloir glycosyltransferases are now resolved. Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide.

These enzymes recognize acceptor substrates and catalyze group-transfer reactions where the monosaccharide moiety of a nucleotide sugar donor substrate is transferred to the acceptor substrate. The specificity of glycosyltransferases allows them to recognize various components of acceptor substrates, such as fucose moieties and specific protein or glycoprotein structures, to facilitate the elongation of glycans on specific glycoconjugates.",Glycosyltransferases act sequentially with the product of one enzyme's activity providing the acceptor substrate for the next.,1.0,0.931262635308284,0.7424070636919698,0.06451612903225806,0.9999999999857143,1.0
What does the human blood group B alpha1-3 galactosyltransferase require to add galactose to a galactose acceptor substrate?,"['Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase.'
 'The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction.'
 'O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer. The α1-2 fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 synthesize the blood group H determinant of O-GalNAc glycans which can be converted by an α1-3 Gal-transferase to blood group B or by an α1-3 GalNAc-transferase to blood group A (Table 10.1).

The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities.'

The B allele of the ABO locus encodes the α1-3GalT (A3GALT1) that forms the B glycan determinant and generates the B blood group (Figure 14.5). O alleles at the ABO locus encode a functionally inactive A/B glycosyltransferase.'
 'Typically, enzymes of this type possess an aspartate, glutamate, or histidine residue whose side chain serves to partially deprotonate the incoming acceptor hydroxyl group (acting as a general base), rendering it a better nucleophile (as shown in Figure 6.6 for the β1-4 galactosyltransferase). Additional structures for GT-B fold inverting glycosyltransferases have been identified in which such a base appears to be lacking. In these cases, a water-mediated proton-shuttle mechanism has been proposed to achieve the required acceptor deprotonation. In addition, these enzymes possess features that help to promote leaving-group departure. In the GT-A enzymes, a metal ion, bound by the DXD motif, is typically positioned to interact with the diphosphate moiety.']",The human blood group B alpha1-3 galactosyltransferase requires the galactose on the acceptor substrate to be modified by fucose in alpha1-2-linkage in order to add galactose in alpha-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of the galactose residue on the acceptor substrate.,The human blood group B alpha1-3 galactosyltransferase only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage.,1.0,0.9271502161746278,0.9021921108436755,0.05263157894736842,0.9666666666473333,1.0

GALNTs coordinate the transfer of GalNAc from the donor substrate (UDP-GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr on acceptor substrates and fall into two general categories: those that require the presence of an extant GalNAc on a peptide or protein before they will add additional GalNAcs (glycopeptide-preferring transferases), and those that will transfer GalNAc to a modified or unmodified protein (peptide transferases).'

We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction.'
 'O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer. The α1-2 fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 synthesize the blood group H determinant of O-GalNAc glycans which can be converted by an α1-3 Gal-transferase to blood group B or by an α1-3 GalNAc-transferase to blood group A (Table 10.1). In addition, α1-3 and α1-3/4 fucosyltransferases synthesize the Lewis antigens (Table 10.1). A number of uncommon and antigenic sugars are also found on O-GalNAc glycans.'
 'Introduction of GlcNAcT-I (MGAT1) in the Golgi initiates complex N-glycan synthesis, and further addition of α3/6-mannosidase II (MAN2A1) and GlcNAcT-II (MGAT2) results in the biantennary GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 N-glycan suitable for appending galactose and sialic acid by further engineering. Some yeast species, including Pichia pastoris, do not contain UDP-Gal, and all yeast lack the native ability to synthesize CMP-Neu5Ac, so considerable engineering with introduction of multiple genes is required to obtain mature complex N-glycans. Although the engineering appears simple in silico, considerable efforts have been devoted to identifying optimal chimeric gene constructs with respect to both catalytic efficiency and ER/Golgi targeting.'
 'Dolichol-P serves an analogous function in eukaryotic cells (Chapter 9). Dolichol-P-mannose provides all of the mannose for glycophospholipid anchors, C-mannosylated proteins, O-mannose-based chains, and four of the mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide used for N-glycan biosynthesis. Dolichol-P-glucose provides glucose for the mature N-linked glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, which itself is built on dolichol pyrophosphate (dolichol-PP). The formation of dolichol-P involves elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate with multiple cis-isopentenyl pyrophosphate units. The total number of isoprene units can vary, from typically 11 in bacteria (making a C55 bactoprenol chain) to up to 21 in mammals.'
 'Biosynthetic pathway of O-mannose glycans.

The initiating O-mannose for α-dystroglycan is transferred by O-mannosyltransferases POMT1 and POMT2 that function together (Figure 13.5).

Which glycosyltransferases add sialic acids to glycan structures?,"['Sialylation blocks the further linear extension of O-glycan chains. Sulfotransferases are localized in the Golgi and cap O-GalNAc glycans with a sulfate ester linked to the 3-position of Gal or the 6-position of GlcNAc. The sulfate group is transferred from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). This adds a negative charge to O-GalNAc glycans of lung, intestinal, and other mucins that has a considerable effect on the chemical and metal ion binding properties of these glycans. GAL3ST4 is the major sulfotransferase acting on the Gal residue of core 1 O-glycans. Skeletal type keratan sulfate (KS) is also an O-GalNAc-linked highly sulfated polysaccharide (Chapter 17). O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized.'
 'Most of these elongation and branching reactions also occur on O- and N-glycans and glycolipids. Some sialyltransferases and sulfotransferases prefer O-GalNAc glycans as substrates but many of these enzymes have an overlapping specificity and also act on N-glycans. A family of α2-6 sialyltransferases (ST6GALNAC1–ST6GALNAC4) with distinct specificities synthesizes sialyl-Tn and sialylated core 1 O-GalNAc glycans. A family of α2-3 sialyltransferases is responsible for the synthesis of sialylated O-GalNAc glycans, with ST3GAL1 being mainly involved in the sialylation of the Galβ1-3 residue of core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans. Sialylation blocks the further linear extension of O-glycan chains.'
 'These α2-8 sialyltransferases are expressed in the brain, where each shows a distinct developmentally regulated expression pattern. ST8SIA1 is also present in kidney and thymus. In vitro experiments imply that certain α2-8-sialylated glycolipids may participate in signal transduction processes in neuronal cell types. Inactivation of the ST8SIA1 gene in the mouse causes alterations in sensory neuron responses to pain. In principle, any free hydroxyl group on a monosaccharide could be modified by sulfation or phosphorylation. However, in vertebrates, glycan sulfation is restricted to Gal, GlcNAc, GlcA, and GalNAc at internal or terminal positions, and phosphorylation has been observed only on Man, GlcNAc, and Xyl to date.'
 'A variety of other pathogens and toxins bind to sialylated termini bearing one of many possible modified sialic acids (Chapter 15). Sialic acid in α2-6 linkage is found on N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycolipids. Two α2-6 sialyltransferases, ST6GAL1 and ST6GAL2, transfer to Gal, whereas ST6GALNAC1–ST6GALNAC6 transfer to GalNAc (ST6GALNAC5 and ST6GALNAC6 also transfer to GlcNAc) (Figure 14.11). In vertebrates, α2-6 sialic acid is found on terminal Gal, on terminal or subterminal GalNAc, or, in the case of reactions catalyzed by ST6GALNAC3 and ST6GALNAC4, on a core GalNAc.'
 'In addition to the Sia linkage, several eukaryotic STs show strong preferences for glycolipids versus glycoproteins and/or the terminal saccharides and sequences. Modified Sias, such as Neu5Gc, O-acetylated species, and unnatural synthetic Sias can be used to form activated CMP-Sias, which can serve as donors for STs. Some mammalian STs transfer both Neu5Ac and Kdn, but others transfer only one or the other. All result in α-sialyl linkages. Furthermore, “trans-sialidases” of some pathogenic trypanosome species and some bacteria transfer Sias from one sialoside to form another (Chapter 43). Although trans-sialidases tend to be specific regarding the sialyl linkage they generate, they can be promiscuous toward the donor and acceptor glycans.'
 'In this way, terminal sialylation can be viewed as an analogous regulatory pathway to intracellular phosphorylation, in which the addition and linkage of sialic acid can control the susceptibility of a wide variety of cell-surface glycans toward glycan binding protein-induced changes in cellular activity. Glycans modified by α2-8 polysialylation occur in vertebrates mainly in developing brain and are carried primarily on the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM. α2-8-sialylated glycans are also expressed on a few glycoproteins in nonneuronal cells and on tumor cells. There are six α2-8 sialyltransferases, ST8SIA1 through ST8SIA6, that transfer sialic acid in α2-8 linkage to a terminal α2-3- or α2-6-linked sialic acid, generally on an N-glycan (Figure 14.12).'
 'The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst.

Which glycosyltransferases add N-acetylglucosamine to glycan structures?,"['Similar to the other activation reactions, N-acetylglucosamine-1-P then reacts with UTP to form UDP-GlcNAc and pyrophosphate. Alternatively, GlcNAc can be directly phosphorylated to form N-acetylglucosamine-6-P by a kinase that also synthesizes N-acetyl-mannosamine-6-P from N-acetylmannosamine. Phospho-N-acetylglucosamine mutase then converts N-acetylglucosamine-6-P to N-acetylglucosamine-1-P. This route may account for the efficient salvage of GlcNAc from lysosomal degradation of glycans. Glucosamine can also be salvaged following sequential phosphorylation and acetylation. In animals, UDP-GalNAc can arise from two routes. One is the direct reaction of N-acetylgalactosamine-1-P with UTP.'
 'In this case, removal of the N-acetylglucosamine moiety by the glycosidase, O-GlcNAcase, provides a means of dynamically regulating the extent of O-GlcNAcylation and the diverse processes that it mediates. Glycosyltransferases catalyze their reactions with either inversion or retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon atom of the donor substrate (Figure 6.5). For example, β1-4 galactosyltransferase, an inverting glycosyltransferase, transfers galactose from UDP-α-Gal to generate a β1-4-linked galactose-containing product. Inversion of stereochemistry follows from the fact that the enzyme uses an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction mechanism in which an acceptor hydroxyl group attacks the anomeric carbon atom of UDP-Gal from one side and UDP leaves from the other (Figure 6.5A).'
 'First, UDP-GlcNAc is converted to N-acetylmannosamine-6-P by bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), a single enzyme with two catalytic activities. The first activity epimerizes the GlcNAc of UDP-GlcNAc at C-2 and cleaves the UDP to yield N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). In the next reaction, the kinase activity uses ATP to form ManNAc-6-P. Mutations in this enzyme cause two completely distinct metabolic disorders: sialuria and inclusion body myopathy type 2 (Chapter 45). Knocking out this gene in mice causes early embryonic lethality. In the next step, ManNAc-6-P is condensed with phosphoenolpyruvate to form N-acetylneuraminic acid-9-P. Phosphate is then removed by a phosphatase.'
 'The donor is formed by conversion of UDP-Gal(p)→UDP-Gal(f) using a flavin adenine dinucleotide–dependent mutase. Enzymatic synthesis of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) begins with the formation of glucosamine-6-P from fructose-6-P by transamination using glutamine as the –NH2 donor by the enzyme glutamine–fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFAT). Glucosamine-6-P is then N-acetylated via an acetyl-CoA-mediated reaction to form N-acetylglucosamine-6-P and then isomerized to N-acetylglucosamine-1-P via a 1,6-bis-phosphate intermediate. Similar to the other activation reactions, N-acetylglucosamine-1-P then reacts with UTP to form UDP-GlcNAc and pyrophosphate.'
 'Thus, extracellular soluble forms of many glycosyltransferases exist in tissues and sera and may function as transferases if nucleotide sugars are present extracellularly. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm, except for CMP-sialic acids, which are synthesized in the nucleus (Chapter 5). They are subsequently concentrated in the appropriate compartment following transport across the membrane by specialized nucleotide sugar transporters that translocate CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Fuc, and other nucleotide sugars. A few of these transporters can transport more than one nucleotide sugar. Each transporter is a multitransmembrane protein that usually contains 10 membrane-spanning domains. Some CMP-sialic acids can be further modified within the lumen of the Golgi by O-acetyl groups before transfer to a glycan acceptor (Chapter 15).'
 'In the first step, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase uses UDP-GlcNAc to generate GlcNAcα1-P-6-Manα1-(N-glycan), and in the second step the N-acetylglucosamine moiety is removed by a second enzyme to give P-6-Manα1-(N-glycan) (Chapter 33). Glycan O-acetylation occurs in bacteria and plants and the O-acetylation of sialic acids is found in bacteria, parasites, and vertebrates. The structure of a plant acetyltransferase suggests the use of a catalytic triad and a double-displacement mechanism for acetyl group transfer analogous to esterases and serine proteases. CASD1, the sialate O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) in humans is a multi-spanning membrane protein with a globular extramembranous catalytic domain. The enzyme transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac.'
 'In animals, UDP-GalNAc can arise from two routes. One is the direct reaction of N-acetylgalactosamine-1-P with UTP. N-Acetylgalactosamine-1-P is formed by a specific kinase that is distinct from galactose-1-kinase. UDP-GalNAc can also be formed by epimerization of UDP-GlcNAc using the same NAD-dependent epimerase that converts UDP-Glc to UDP-Gal. The sialic acids include three parent compounds—N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and Kdn (Chapter 15)—all of which are converted to CMP nucleotide sugars. Generation of cytidine-5′-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) is more complicated than formation of the other activated sugars.']",Glycosyltransferases that add N-acetylglucosamine to glycan structures include GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE).,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases attach N-acetylglucosamine to glycan chains,0.0,0.9629862277979647,0.7494630516686211,0.02564102564102564,0.91666666664375,1.0
What are some examples of human fucosyltransferases?,"['Three core fucosyltransferases have been characterized and the glycomes of the corresponding mutants analyzed. Although the fut-8 gene encodes an enzyme with the same specificity as the mammalian FUT8 α1-6 fucosyltransferases, two α1-3 fucosyltransferases (FUT-1 and FUT-6) with unusual substrate preferences transfer fucose to the proximal and distal core GlcNAc residues; whereas FUT-1, unlike plant and insect core α1-3 fucosyltransferases, cannot transfer to glycans with a β1-2GlcNAc on the α1-3-mannose, the action of FUT-6 is blocked by the presence of α1-6-mannose. Activity of recombinant forms of two α1-2 fucosyltransferases and a fucose-modifying β1-4-galactosyltransferase (GALT-1) have also been reported.'
 'In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities.'
 'Also, mice genetically deficient in the GDP-Man to GDP-Fuc conversion can be rescued by providing fucose in their food or drinking water. Plasma membrane transporters for sugars other than glucose have been characterized, and fucose transporters may exist as well, although they have not been fully characterized, so their quantitative contribution is not known. As with many monosaccharides other than glucose, free fucose concentration in the blood is in the very low micromolar range. Conversion of activated sugar donors.

 'This molecule is activated with CTP to produce CMP-Kdn and is abundant in fish (e.g., in trout testis and on their sperm), in which it is thought to be important for sperm–egg adhesion. Guanosine diphosphate fucose (GDP-Fuc) can be derived from GDP-Man by the sequential action of two enzymes involving three steps. In the first step, the C-4 hydroxyl group of GDP-Man is oxidized to a ketone (GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-mannose) by the enzyme GDP-Man 4,6-dehydratase, along with the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The next two reactions are catalyzed by a single polypeptide (GDP-L-Fuc synthase in humans) that has epimerase and reductase activity and is well-conserved from bacteria to mammals.'
 'Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26).'
 'GDP-Fucose (Fuc) can be synthesized from GDP-Man or obtained via fucose salvage. In the salvage pathway, Fuc is converted into Fuc-1-P by fucose kinase and then to GDP-Fuc by GDP-Fuc pyrophosphorylase (Chapter 5). The contribution of the endogenous versus the salvage pathway in different cells and tissues is not yet known. A disease in the salvage pathway has been reported due to mutations in FCSK (fucose kinase), resulting in a severe neurological syndrome with encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability. Patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD-II or SLC35C1-CDG) have mutations in SLC35C1, encoding the GDP-Fuc transporter in the Golgi. Here, transferrin sialylation was normal, so this defect was not detected by the usual test, but some serum proteins and O-linked glycans on leukocyte surface proteins were deficient in Fuc.']",Human fucosyltransferases III-VII are examples of human fucosyltransferases.,"The following enzymes are human glycosyltransferase genes: FUT1, FUT2, FUT3, FUT4, FUT5, FUT6, FUT7, FUT8, FUT9, FUT10, FUT11",1.0,0.9940164108947542,0.6569513871081,0.11764705882352941,0.8766666666491334,0.0
What are some examples of human galactosyltransferases?,"['This is probably because the galactosyltransferases that synthesize the core region tetrasaccharide common to GAG chains have lower Km values for their donors (Chapter 17). Many putative transporters were identified by homology in the genomes of mammals, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, plants, and yeast. Like the plasma membrane GLUT transporters discussed above, all are multimembrane-spanning (type III) proteins, but the level of amino acid identity does not give any clue to the substrate specificity. The UDP-GlcNAc transporters from mammalian cells and yeast are 22% identical, whereas mammalian CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GlcNAc transporters have 40%–50% identity. Clever domain-swapping experiments show that distinct regions are responsible for functional transport, and engineered chimeric transporters can carry both CMP-Sia and UDP-Gal.'
 'Deletion of single GALNTs in mammals results in organ and cell differentiation defects. The GALNTs are found throughout the animal kingdom but not in bacteria, yeast, or plants. All GALNTs are classified in the GT27 CaZy family with a GT-A fold (Chapter 8), and most have a lectin (ricin-like) domain at the carboxyl terminus, which is unique among glycosyltransferases. GALNTs coordinate the transfer of GalNAc from the donor substrate (UDP-GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr on acceptor substrates and fall into two general categories: those that require the presence of an extant GalNAc on a peptide or protein before they will add additional GalNAcs (glycopeptide-preferring transferases), and those that will transfer GalNAc to a modified or unmodified protein (peptide transferases).'
 'Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase.'
 'Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20).

What factors contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species?,"['In contrast, bacterial sialyltransferases bear little resemblance to those of eukaryotes, and the vast sequence differences between different bacterial sialyltransferases indicate that these have even been reinvented on several separate occasions. Of course, lateral gene transfer is common among Bacteria and Archaea, facilitating rapid phylogenetic dissemination of such enzymatic “inventions.” Why do closely related species differ with regard to the presence or absence of certain glycans? Does the same glycoprotein have the same type of glycosylation in distinct but related species? Relatively little data exist regarding these issues, but examples of both, extreme conservation and diversification are found. A reasonable explanation is that conservation of glycan structure reflects specific functional constraints for the glycans in question. In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral).'
 'If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species.'
 'This variation is also associated with spontaneously appearing and persistently circulating antibodies against the missing glycan determinant, thus forming a kind of “interspecies blood group.” This glycan difference may also be protective for the primate lineage which lost the “αGal” structure and has a high-titer circulating antibody, as it is now better protected against infection by enveloped viruses emanating from other mammals. Independent losses of the vertebrate-specific sialic acid Neu5Gc in humans and some other mammalian clades is a further example of glycan evolution by loss of function (Chapter 15). In the process, these lineages have lost a potent signal of self, resulting in protection from microbes that synthesize this glycan. Regardless of the mechanisms maintaining these types of polymorphisms, such intra- and interspecies diversity might also provide for “herd immunity,” a phenomenon whereby one glycan variant–resistant individual can indirectly protect other susceptible individuals by restricting the spread of a pathogen through the population.'
 'Evolutionary processes that likely determine generation of glycan diversity are briefly considered, including intrinsic host glycan-binding protein functions and interactions of hosts with extrinsic pathogens or symbionts. The genetic code is shared by all known organisms, and core functions such as gene transcription and energy generation are conserved across taxa. Complex glycans are found in all organisms in nature, and some have argued that polysaccharides were the original macromolecules contributing to the origin of life itself. Regardless of their origins, they vary immensely in structure and expression (abundance and patterns of distribution in and on cells, secretions, and extracellular matrices) both within and between evolutionary lineages. Partly because of inherent difficulties in elucidating their structures, our knowledge about this diversity remains limited, and there are few comprehensive data sets. For many taxa, there is a lack of any information on glycan profiles.'
 'Even in the absence of important endogenous functions, glycans can have key roles in mediating interactions with symbionts and pathogens. The evolution of diversity and microheterogeneity (across tissues and cell types) in glycosylation could well be of value to the organisms in providing additional obstacles to pathogens that use host glycans for attachment and entry. Free glycans (e.g., milk oligosaccharides) can also have important roles in attracting and feeding symbiont microbial communities needed for internal functions (e.g., immune maturation) and in accommodating or restricting these to particular areas of the host. There can even be significant variation in glycosylation among members of the same species, particularly in terminal glycan sequences. The classic example is the ABH(O) histo-blood group system (Chapter 14), a polymorphism found in all human populations, which has also persisted for tens of millions of years of primate evolution and has even been independently rederived in some instances.'
 'Despite the enormous potential for structural diversity, a rather limited subset of all possible monosaccharides and their possible linkages and modifications are found in eukaryotic cells. Why one encounters only such a limited subset of the possible glycan structures is a puzzling question. Could there be trade-offs between the variety of glycan structures and the additional resources, such as energy and biosynthetic pathways, that cells/organisms need in order to maintain that variety? Or maybe the variety of structures is limited by a combination of positive and negative selection due to both, its intrinsic functions and interactions with symbionts and pathogens? Regardless, this limited subset has allowed better elucidation of structures of eukaryotic glycans. In contrast, Bacteria and Archaea have had several billion additional years to respond to selective pressure from pathogens; in particular, phages. These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow.'
 'Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role.']","Factors such as specific functional constraints, conservation of glycan structure reflecting functional needs, evolutionary drift tolerance as long as primary functions are maintained, and trade-offs between glycan variety and resource allocation may contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species. Additionally, interactions with symbionts and pathogens, as well as the role of glycan structures in mediating host-pathogen interactions, can also influence the evolutionary persistence of glycan diversity across biological taxa.","There is too little information available today to allow a comprehensive exposition of the evolution of even the major classes of glycans. However, based on available data, it is reasonable to suggest that selective pressures largely come from either intrinsic or extrinsic factors related to organism-specific functions of glycans and competitive host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Host glycans must evolve rapidly to compete with pathogens that have short generation times, high mutation rates, and horizontal gene transfer, yet glycans with a critical intrinsic role may incur deleterious effects if eliminated or mutated.",1.0,0.7653300266560559,0.7125068732309201,0.11627906976744186,0.9999999999857143,1.0
What is the significance of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains?,"['R-type lectins have a fold termed “β-trefoil fold” (from the Latin “trifolium” meaning “three-leaved,” as seen for example in clover) (Figure 31.4). The β-trefoil fold presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding the 40-residue subdomain. The three subdomains, termed α, β, and γ, each consist of 12 β-strands and loops arranged around a central axis, giving the protein internal pseudorotation symmetry. β-trefoil fold is maintained by the characteristic Q-x-W motif in each subdomain of ricin B-chain and common R-type lectins. More than 10% of lectins use this fold for glycan recognition (Chapter 30). Structures of β-trefoil folds of R-type lectin domains in various proteins.'
 'More than 10% of lectins use this fold for glycan recognition (Chapter 30). Structures of β-trefoil folds of R-type lectin domains in various proteins. (Top) Structures derived from bacteria, fungi, and slime molds: AH (actinohivin in actinobacteria; PDB 4DEN), CNL (nematocidal lectin from conifer-loving mushroom Clitocybe (more...) In view of the conserved structures consisting of variable loops and a short β-barrel, in combination with low sequence homology based on β-strands connected by loops, the ability of β-trefoil proteins to flexibly select a variety of carbohydrate partners is not surprising.'
 'In each subunit, the α- and β-subdomain functioned, respectively, to capture carbohydrates and subunits connected by a disulfide bond. Prototype and tandem-repeat R-type lectins consisting solely of β-trefoil domains have been identified in various invertebrate groups, including sponges (phylum Porifera), earthworms (Annelida) (EW29: PDB 2ZQN), bivalves (Mollusca) (UniProt A0A646QVV9), and brachiopods (Brachiopoda) (UniProt A0A646QV64).'
 'LSL from Laetiporus sulphureus (a bracket fungus) has a β-trefoil fold but not a Q-x-W motif. Studies of R-type lectins in protists are at an early stage. One was recently found in the anaerobic parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Chapter 43), a Gal/GalNAc-binding prototype R-type lectin (PDB 6IFB) consisting of two β-trefoil subunits. In each subunit, the α- and β-subdomain functioned, respectively, to capture carbohydrates and subunits connected by a disulfide bond.'
 'Almost all the configurations seen in invertebrate R-type lectins are also found in bacterial R-type lectins. β-trefoil fold is a very effective protein scaffold for biological functions. Living systems have evidently improved their survival strategies by evolutionary tinkering of the R-type lectin domain per se, or by linking it with other functional domains. UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs: EC 2.4.1.41) have chimeric-form R-type lectin structures consisting of a catalytic subdomain (amino-terminal) and an R-type lectin domain (carboxy-terminal) (PDB 1HXB). Mucin-type O-glycans have a common core structure GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (Figure 31.5), which can be modified by addition of Gal or GalNAc residues (Chapter 10).'
 ""β-Trefoil proteins have been divided into several groups on the basis of biological function; these include lectins, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (PDB 2AXM; Chapter 38), interleukin-1 (PDB 1ILT), Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (PDB 4IHZ), and the actin cross-linking protein hisactophilin (PDB 1HCE), although they have no Q-x-W motif. Each subdomain could conceivably have a carbohydrate-binding site; however, in most R-type lectins only one or two subdomains bind a carbohydrate ligand. Carbohydrate-binding of RCA-I and RCA-II arises from aromatic amino acids stacking against Gal/GalNAc residues and from hydrogen bonding between aa's and hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate ligands. A wide variety of R-type lectins with diverse configurations, including RIP-IIs and heterotetramers such as RCA-II, have been purified from various plant tissues.""
 'Discovery of new R-type lectins is ongoing. The ancestor of this superfamily is not yet clear, but it is found in members of all biological domains. The origins and evolution of these lectins are therefore of interest to scientists in many fields. The presence of β-trefoil folding in proteins may reflect either convergent or divergent evolution. Elucidating the physiological functions of various R-type lectins will require identification of their endogenous ligands and the specific environmental stimuli that trigger their expression. Increasing knowledge of R-type lectin structure and function will enhance our understanding of lectin-glycan interactions in living systems and facilitate biotechnological applications of these lectins.

What is a common mechanism by which plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells?,"['The latter three lectins are heterodimeric, disulfide-bonded proteins that are classified as type-II ribosome-inactivating proteins; they contain an A subunit that constitutes an enzyme called RNA-N-glycosidase, which inactivates the 28S ribosome, and a B subunit that is a galactose-binding lectin (Chapter 31). Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture. One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors.'
 'One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained. More details about glycosylation mutants of cultured cells are presented in Chapter 49. The specificity of lectins and antibodies to particular glycans has made them especially useful in cloning genes encoding glycosyltransferases or other proteins required for proper glycosylation, such as nucleotide sugar transporters. For example, CHO cells and the African green monkey kidney cell line COS lack glycans with terminal α-galactose residues.'
 'There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development. L-type lectins are involved in the symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as in Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, but the precise function of lectins in this regard is unclear. A recent study has shown that the D. biflorus seed lectin is also a lipoxygenase. It will be of interest to see how many other L-type lectins have this activity, which is necessary to initiate the wound-induced defense pathway in plants.'
 'Interaction between prototype R-type lectin and ganglioside-induced cytotoxicity against mammalian neoplastic cells through activation of MAP kinases. Another family of mussel lectins (MytiLec: PDB 3WMV; CGL: PDB 5F90) has a β-trefoil fold but not Q-x-W motif. Similar to Shiga toxins (Chapter 37), these lectins captured three Gb3 (Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc) glycans in three carbohydrate-binding pockets within the β-trefoil fold, and thereby induced signal transduction. Chimera-type R-type lectins connect with various functional domains in invertebrates. Pierisin in cabbage butterfly (Arthropoda, order Lepidoptera) larvae expresses R-type lectin domain at the carboxyl terminus of an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (Uniprot Q9U8Q4) and induces apoptosis of cancer cells.'
 'It will be of interest to see how many other L-type lectins have this activity, which is necessary to initiate the wound-induced defense pathway in plants. Regardless of their physiological function, legume L-type lectins might be useful in applications requiring agents with antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal or antinociceptive properties. In addition, given their well-established glycan recognition preferences, these plant lectins are useful for glycophenotyping different cell types in physiological and pathological settings by means of immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical analysis. Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) are homologous molecular chaperones that mediate quality control of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (see Chapter 39). Although CRT is a soluble ER luminal component, CNX is membrane-bound and is perhaps closely associated with the protein-translocating channel that imports nascent proteins into the ER.'
 'All soluble L-type lectins found to date are multimeric proteins, although all do not have the same quaternary structure. Thus, these lectins are multivalent with more than one glycan-binding site per lectin molecule. The same multivalent principle applies to the membrane bound L-type lectins because the presence of two or more molecules on a membrane surface essentially presents a multivalent situation. In addition to increasing the avidity of the lectins for branched and/or cell-surface glycans, this multivalence can have great biological significance. Binding of the lectins to the cell surface can lead to aggregation of specific glycan receptors, promoting a variety of biological responses such as mitogenesis and various signal transduction processes. Plant L-type lectins are primarily found in the seeds of leguminous plants and are synthesized during seed development several weeks after flowering; they are transported to the vacuole where they become condensed into specialized vesicles called protein bodies.'
 'Neither lectin binds appreciably to glycoconjugates having nonreducing terminal α-linked Gal residues. Ricin is highly toxic and the effects of ingestion are severe, with symptoms appearing after a 2- to 24-h latent period. The lethal dose (LD50) of ricin is extremely low (3–5 µg/kg body weight). Ricin is classified as a type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP-II). RCA-I (agglutinin) is less toxic than ricin, because of the weaker enzymatic activity of its A-chain. Type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP-I), which lack a B chain with R-type lectin domains, are much less toxic than ricin because toxin entry into target cells is facilitated by B-chain carbohydrate-binding activity. RIP-I expressed in tissues of various types of plants affects disease resistance.']","One common mechanism by which plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells is through the induction of apoptosis, possibly by interfering with receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors.","Many plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas other lectins, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not toxic to animal cells in culture.

How do conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates?,"['Early studies suggested species specificity in the occurrence of specific Sia variants. With analytical improvements, it became evident that Sia variations are more widely expressed across species but occur at differing levels. Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage (Chapter 27), which comprises vertebrates and some “higher” invertebrates (such as echinoderms). Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates. This may change as molecular techniques improve. For example, insects were believed to be free of Sias until their discovery in cicada Malpighian tubules and Drosophila brains, and later identification of a single Drosophila gene (SiaT) with sequence similarities to mammalian STs. When SiaT is inactivated, flies suffer locomotor abnormalities and defects in neuromuscular junctions. Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila.'
 'Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila. Sias have also been reported in the nervous systems of behaviorally complex protostomes like octopus and squid. On the other hand, no Sias or ST genes were found in the well-studied round worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25). It appears that Sias (other than Kdn, which probably appeared earlier) were “invented” in a common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes and then became essential in deuterostomes, while being partially or completely discarded in some protostome lineages. Interestingly, there is wide variation in Sia expression and complexity within deuterostomes, with the sialome of echinoderms appearing very complex and that of humans being among the simplest.'
 'They appear in bacteria from diverse taxa with varied lifestyles in the environment or with animals, including “lower” animals often in internally linked positions that do not mimic known structures in “higher” animals. Sias became prominent in animals when the Deuterostome lineage emerged at the Cambrian Explosion ∼530 million years ago. Sequence homology suggests that ancient prokaryotic NulO biosynthetic pathways later became an evolutionary template that allowed some microbes to reinvent Sias of “higher” animals by convergent evolution. Many important commensals and pathogens use Sia mimicry to evade the vertebrate immune system by one or more of several established mechanisms. Some of the prokaryotic NulOs that share the same stereochemistry as Sias can engage in mechanisms of Sia mimicry, at times conveying pathogenic properties in unintended hosts following environmental exposure or zoonosis. Some examples of bacterial NulO-containing structures are provided (Figure 15.5).'
 'Notably, all the above examples of vertebrate Sia-recognizing proteins were discovered serendipitously, via the unexpected abrogating effect of sialidases on a biological process. To date, there has been no systematic effort to search for other examples, but other likely vertebrate Sia-binding lectins are PECAM-1, PILRs, L1-CAM, HMGB-1, and an as-yet-unidentified uterine agglutinin. The many functions of Sias in vertebrates make these molecules particularly attractive targets for microbes that co-exist with the host, whether harmoniously or not. As discussed elsewhere, there are several independent mechanisms of Sia mimicry, which promote bacterial interactions with host factor H and Siglecs to enable survival in the host. Some Sia-binding lectins are found in organisms that do not themselves appear to express Sias (see Table 15.1 for examples).'
 'In fact, Sias that are synthesized by some present-day vertebrate pathogens share closer phylogenetic relationships to biosynthetic pathways for legionaminic acids than to Sia pathways of vertebrates. Other microbes “steal” Sias from their host using various mechanisms to achieve “molecular mimicry.” Neisseria gonorrheae even has a remarkably efficient surface ST that can scavenge trace amounts of CMP-Neu5Ac from body fluids of its exclusive host, humans. A diverse array of Sia-like molecules (see Figure 15.1) with ancient evolutionary roots has been described in Bacteria and archaea and the relevant biosynthetic pathways are predicted to occur in ∼20% of prokaryotes. These molecules differ from Sias in several ways. First, they lack a hydroxyl group at C9 and nearly all described forms have amino functions at C7 that are often decorated with substituents.'
 'In eukaryotes, cytosolic CMP-Sia feeds back to inhibit GNE. In a rare human disease called sialuria, dominant mutations in the allosteric site of GNE result in failed feedback regulation and overproduction of Sia. The linkage-specific STs mentioned earlier are type II membrane proteins in animals, with signals leading to their Golgi localization. Animal STs share amino acid sequence motifs (sialylmotifs) that include shared sites for CMP-Sia recognition (Chapters 6 and 8). In contrast, prokaryotic STs emerged independently by convergent evolution, do not have sialylmotifs, and some do not even share homology. In addition to the Sia linkage, several eukaryotic STs show strong preferences for glycolipids versus glycoproteins and/or the terminal saccharides and sequences.'
 'Although expression of Neu5Gc and 9-O-acetylated Sias is very common in deuterostomes, exceptions exist, such as independent loss of Neu5Gc biosynthesis in humans, New World monkeys, Sauropsids (birds and reptiles, the descendants of dinosaurs), the Pinnipedia and Musteloidia members of the Carnivora, and likely in Monotremes. Sias in capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides can have beneficial effects for microbes in their hosts, protecting them from complement activation and/or antibody recognition of underlying glycans, also sometimes engaging the Siglec family receptors (Chapter 35) to dampen innate immune cell reactivity. The bacterial enzymes involved in synthesizing and metabolizing Sias do not appear to be the result of lateral transfer of genes from animals, but evolved independently, apparently being “reinvented” at least twice from a more ancient prokaryotic NulO pathway.']","Conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates in that Sia variations are more widely expressed across species but occur at differing levels.

Increased diversity within vertebrate lineages is inferred to have resulted from divergent evolution, with a variety of gain-of-function and loss-of-function events identified in sialyltransferases throughout their evolutionary history.",1.0,0.9851753290000723,0.5889850802483817,0.02564102564102564,0.9666666666473333,0.0
What's the relationship between Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes and plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis?,"['Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles. This is in contrast to cellulose, which is synthesized at the plasma membrane where the glucan chains are extruded into the apoplast to form cellulose microfibrils. Lignin is polymerized in the apoplast by nonenzymatic radical reactions. Despite advances in identifying and understanding the GTs involved in polysaccharide synthesis, we still do not know how many of the wall polymers are synthesized by Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes or if they are assembled by GTs localized in different regions of the Golgi apparatus. We also do not understand how the newly synthesized polymers are assembled into a functional cell wall in the apoplast. Plants produce glycoproteins and proteoglycans that contain oligo- or polysaccharides that are linked to hydroxyproline (Hyp) and serine (Ser).'
 'This sequence is required for normal xylan synthesis during secondary cell-wall formation and may have a role in regulating the polymers chain length. This sequence is present at the reducing end of heteroxylans of all monocots except the grasses. Genes that encode polysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes, including many of those required for xyloglucan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose synthesis and some of those required for pectin synthesis, have been identified. This information, together with improved methods to demonstrate enzymatic activity of recombinant plant GTs in vitro and wall structural analyses of the corresponding plant mutants is providing a framework for an increased understanding of how plant cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized. Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles.'
 'In contrast, homogalacturonan is continually modified by the action of wall enzymes and its contribution to wall architecture is therefore time dependent. Increased knowledge of the physical properties of primary wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans is required to understand how modulating the amounts and structural features of a few common polysaccharides and glycan domains lead to primary walls with diverse properties and functionalities. Further research is also needed to determine if wall structure and function results from the noncovalent interactions of polysaccharides and proteoglycans or from the formation of glycan-containing architectural units with specific structural and functional roles. The latter scenario is analogous to the organization of proteoglycans and O-linked mucins in the extracellular matrix of animal cells (Chapters 10, 16, and 17). The secondary walls of woody tissue and grasses are composed predominantly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and the polyphenol lignin.'
 ""Many of these effects may result from the ability of oligogalacturonides to alter the plant's responses to the hormone auxin. Oligogalacturonide receptor proteins (WAKs) have been reported to bind to cell wall pectin and thereby affect plant cell expansion. Auxin-induced elongation of pea stem segments is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of a nonasaccharide-rich fragment of xyloglucan (Figure 40.2). Plants may also use endogenous Nod-factor-like signals to regulate their growth and development. Recent work on plants with altered lignin structure/composition suggests that plants have the ability to monitor changes in the structures of their walls and to trigger responses distinct from those involved in plant defense. In this case, the released active oligosaccharides appear to be fragments of rhamnogalacturonans, which are distinct from the oligogalacturonides involved in plant defense.""
 'Secondary cell walls account for most of the carbohydrate in plant biomass, such as straw for animal feed and wood for the production of paper and lumber for construction. Because of its abundance, plant biomass is also considered as a renewable, carbon-neutral feedstock for the production of biofuels, biomaterials, and other value-added commodity chemicals (Chapter 59). Primary cell walls are composites that resemble fiber-reinforced porous, aqueous gels. The complex structures and functions of these walls result from the assembly and interactions of a limited number of structurally defined polysaccharides and proteoglycans. Nevertheless, wall structure and organization differ between plant species and in different tissue and cell types within a plant. Moreover, during cell division and differentiation, and in response to biotic and abiotic challenges, a cell often responds by the differential synthesis and modification of the noncellulosic components or by the addition of new components. Primary walls of land plants contain cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, in different proportions.'
 ""Oligogalacturonides composed of 1-4-linked α-GalA residues are one example of oligosaccharins released from plant cell wall polysaccharides, in this specific case from homogalacturonans by endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) secreted by the pathogen. The activities of such pathogen-derived EPGs are frequently inhibited or modulated by polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIP) produced by plants. Similarly, oligoglucosides composed of 1-6- and 1-3-linked β-Glc residues released from the mycelial walls of the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae by plant endo-glucanases were an early example of oligosaccharins generated from a pathogen's cell wall.""
 'Each Xylp residue may itself be extended by the addition of one or more monosaccharides including β-D-Galp, α-L-Fucp, α-L-Araf, α-L-Arap, β-D-Xylp, β-D-GalpA, and O-acetyl substituents. Twenty-three structurally unique side chains have been identified to date, although only a subset of these are synthesized by a single plant species. Early models of dicot primary walls predicted that xyloglucans acted as tethers between cellulose microfibrils and that controlled enzymatic cleavage or reorganization of xyloglucan by proteins facilitated wall expansion and thus plant cell growth. However, this notion has been challenged by genetic engineering of xyloglucan structures in Arabidopsis plants, which revealed that eliminating xyloglucan entirely from the primary wall has remarkably little effect on overall plant growth and development.']","The relationship between Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes and plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is not fully understood, as it is still unclear whether many of the wall polymers are synthesized by Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes or if they are assembled by glycosyltransferases (GTs) localized in different regions of the Golgi apparatus. Further research is needed to determine the specific roles and mechanisms of Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes in the synthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides.","The plant Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in cell wall biosynthesis, as it is the location for production of cell wall matrix polysaccharides, modification of protein glycosylation, and assembly/trafficking of cellulos synthase complexes.",1.0,0.9349829957915995,0.7537699645053131,0.05555555555555555,0.8734126983981415,1.0
How are glycans typically implicated in congenital disorders?,"['Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification. (For simplicity, disorders affecting multiple pathways are included in disorders (more...) Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans  The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation. The first were identified in the early 1980s based primarily on deficiencies in multiple plasma glycoproteins. The patients were also delayed in reaching growth and developmental milestones and had low muscle tone, incomplete brain development, visual problems, coagulation defects, and endocrine abnormalities. However, many of these symptoms are also seen in patients with other multisystemic genetic syndromes.'
 'Among genetic disorders of glycosylation, those caused by somatic mutations are described in Chapter 46. Disorders affecting the lysosomal degradation of glycans are described in Chapter 44. Although the term “congenital disorders” by definition include those caused by nongenetic, unfavorable in utero conditions, the term “congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)” is now widely used as an equivalent of inherited disorders of glycosylation. Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33) it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found. In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations. Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms.'
 'N-glycosylation defects may be divided into two types based on transferrin glycoforms. Type I (CDG-I) patients lack one or both N-glycans because of defects in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) or its transfer to proteins. Type II (CDG-II) patients have incomplete protein-bound glycans because of abnormal processing. The biosynthetic pathways and locations of N-glycan defects are shown in Figure 45.2. Congenital disorders of glycosylation in the N-glycosylation pathway. The figure shows individual steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, glycan transfer to protein, and N-glycan processing similar to Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4. The shuttling (more...) A complete absence of N-glycans is lethal. Therefore, known mutations mostly generate hypomorphic alleles encoding proteins with diminished activity.'
 'Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis. A few disorders can be treated by the consumption of monosaccharides.'
 'Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms. The test was positive in these children, thereby, for the first time, indicating a generic defect in protein N-glycosylation. Lacking further details about glycan structures and the underlying genetic variants, Jaeken decided to call these cases “carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes” (CDGS). Several years later, many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases. To keep the acronym “CDG,” those involved also decided to call them “congenital disorders of glycosylation,” rather than inherited genetic defects in glycosylation. Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems.'
 'Patients present with a relatively mild clinical course without neurological symptoms, which can be explained by the fact that related genes are expressed in different tissues, such as B4GALT2 in the brain. A similar glycan pattern occurs in the X-linked SLC35A2-CDG, because of loss of UDP-Gal transporter activity. Surprisingly, within a few years after birth, abnormal glycosylation becomes normal. This is probably caused by somatic mosaicism of cells carrying the mutated SLC35A2 gene along with unaffected cells and by selection against the affected cells. Patients suffer from a mainly neurological phenotype. Defects in the glycosyltransferase MGAT2 and glycosidase MAN1B1 also result in characteristic glycan abnormalities on transferrin and other proteins that are now used to diagnose patients, whereas FUT8-CDG shows normal glycosylation of transferrin but severe fucosylation defects on total serum proteins.'
 'Mutations in OGT, encoding the GlcNAc-transferase that acts on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 18), cause intellectual disability. The mutations cluster in the region encoding TRP-repeats of the OGT enzyme, implicating altered substrate recognition and O-GlcNAc modification of specific cytosolic and nuclear proteins as a pathogenic mediator. Proteoglycans and their GAG chains are critical components in extracellular matrices. For a discussion of their biosynthesis, core proteins, and function, see Chapter 17. Genetic defects in GAG synthesis can be divided into so-called linkeropathies, because of defects in the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker, defects in the synthesis of the polysaccharides, and defects in GAG modification, mainly sulfation.']","Glycans are typically implicated in congenital disorders through genetic defects in glycan biosynthesis pathways, leading to a range of rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous disorders that usually affect multiple organ systems. These congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are characterized by abnormalities in glycan structures due to mutations affecting various steps in glycosylation processes. The critical biological roles of glycans in humans are highlighted by the rarity of complete defects in glycosylation, as embryos with such defects usually do not survive to be born. Patients with CDGs often have hypomorphic alleles that retain some activity of the affected pathways, emphasizing the importance of glycosylation in human biology.","Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs (congenital disorders of glycosylation) are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several.

How are glycans typically implicated in cancer?,"['Mucins might also interfere with immune cell recognition and block or mask presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. A hallmark feature of carcinomas is the aberrant synthesis of incomplete O-glycans, present in mucins and other glycoproteins, typified by the Tn and T antigens and their sialylated glycoforms, sialyl-Tn (STn) and sialyl-T (ST) (Figure 47.2). Secreted glycoproteins expressing STn often appear in the bloodstream of patients with cancer. Because these glycans occur infrequently in normal tissues, they serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Truncated O-glycans evoke immune responses in the patient, and accordingly, vaccines against these glycans have been developed. As an alternative, incomplete O-glycans can serve as targets for a variety of therapeutic antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.'
 'Other important biomarkers include SLex-related glycans, which are used in lung and breast cancer to monitor residual disease after surgery. In recent years, there has been a major interest in glycomic profiling of serum and other body fluid glycoproteins, in addition to glycoproteins in extracellular vesicles. Classic findings of glycan-specific antibodies associated with cancer, such as the antibodies against the nonhuman Sia, Neu5Gc, are also being reinvestigated. Another potential advance lies in improving the specificity of known cancer biomarkers by defining glycoprotein glycoforms uniquely expressed by cancer cells (e.g., prostate-specific antigen). In tandem with their roles as biomarkers, glycans are important targets for cancer therapeutics. A monoclonal antibody against GD2 has been U.S.'
 'The expression of Tn and STn can enhance tumorigenic and invasive properties, and promote immunosuppression. Loss of normal topology and polarization of epithelial cells in cancer results in secretion of mucins with truncated O-GalNAc glycans, such as sialyl-Tn (STn) and Tn, into the bloodstream. Tumor cells invading tissues and the bloodstream also present (more...) Sialylation is generally increased in tumor cells, both on N-glycans and O-glycans. N-glycan sialylation serves as a regulatory mechanism for multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, illustrated by activation of MET and RON receptors by α2-3Sia. Increased α2-6Sia on N-glycans, due to ST6GAL1 up-regulation in cancer cells, enhances integrin-mediated cell motility and protects cells against apoptosis induced by galectins, death receptor ligands, and chemotherapeutic drugs.'
 'Tumor hypoxia may also affect the incorporation of diet-derived nonhuman Neu5Gc in human tumor cells by up-regulating transcription of the lysosomal sialin Sia transporter. Down-regulation of glycosylation genes by DNA methylation or histone deacetylation/trimethylation may silence glycosylation genes that appear to suppress tumor progression in some types of cancers, like MGAT3 or ST6GAL1. Posttranscriptional regulation of glycosylation pathways through microRNAs is also involved in tumor progression. Cancer stem cells, or tumor-initiating cells, constitute a small subpopulation of cancer cells that has tumor-initiating capability. Several glycans that are specific markers for embryonic stem cells (stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 [SSEA-3], SSEA-3 with fucose [Globo H], and SSEA-4) are also expressed by cancer stem cells.'
 'The earliest evidence of altered glycosylation as a hallmark of cancer was that some plant lectins show enhanced binding and agglutination of tumor cells. Next, it was found that transformation of cultured cells is frequently accompanied by a general increase in the size of glycopeptides of cell-surface glycoproteins. With the advent of monoclonal antibody technology, many “tumor-specific” antibodies directed against glycan epitopes were found. In many instances, these epitopes represented “oncofetal antigens”—that is, glycan epitopes expressed on tumor cells and embryonic tissues. Like normal cells during embryogenesis, tumor cells also undergo rapid growth and invade tissues. Correlations between certain types of altered glycosylation and the prognosis of tumor-bearing animals or patients increased interest in glycan changes. In vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies have now supported the conclusion that glycan changes are critical to several aspects of tumor cell behavior.'
 'In vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies have now supported the conclusion that glycan changes are critical to several aspects of tumor cell behavior. Glycan changes in malignant cells take a variety of forms: loss of expression or excessive expression of certain glycans, increased expression of incomplete or truncated glycans, and, less commonly, the appearance of novel glycans. However, this is not simply the random consequence of disordered biosynthesis in tumor cells. It is striking that a very limited subset of changes are correlated with malignant transformation and tumor progression, highlighting a potential functional role in tumor biology. Given that cancer is a “microevolutionary” process in which only the fittest cells survive, and that tumors are under immune surveillance pressure, it is likely that these specific glycan changes are selected for during tumor progression.'
 'For example, disialyl-Lea and sialyl-6-sulfo-Lex structures may protect against early carcinogenic events by binding to Siglec-7 on macrophages. This interaction suppresses macrophage production of the pro-oncogenic inflammatory mediator, Cox2, thereby exerting an anti-oncogenic function. However, during cancer development, many other sialylated glycan ligands for Siglecs are increased, and these bind to inhibitory Siglecs on various immune cell populations to induce immunosuppression and facilitate tumor progression. In normal physiology platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells interact via selectins and selectin ligands. In invasive carcinoma, interactions that promote invasion occur between tumor cells expressing selectin ligands and selectins on endothelial (more...) Loss of AB blood group expression in the context of carcinoma (accompanied by exposure of underlying H and Ley epitopes) (Chapter 14) is associated with poor prognosis.']","Glycans are typically implicated in cancer through various mechanisms such as altered glycosylation patterns, increased expression of incomplete or truncated glycans, loss or excessive expression of certain glycans, and the appearance of novel glycans. These specific glycan changes are selected for during tumor progression, playing critical roles in tumor cell behavior, tumorigenic properties, invasive properties, immunosuppression, and promoting tumor progression. Glycans also serve as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer, with some glycans serving as prognostic indicators and potential targets for cancer therapeutics.","Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression.

More specifically, studies have observed: altered branching and fucosylation of N-glycans, altered mucin expression and truncated O-glycans, altered sialic acid expression, increased selectin ligand expression, altered expression of blood groups, altered expression of glycosphingolipids, loss of GPI-anchor expression, along with several other changes in tumor cells.

Describe the basic structure of biantennary glycans,"['The depicted glycan is a biantennary glycan with branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain. However, more complex structures exist with three and four branches. Details of the synthesis and biological importance of these glycans are presented in Chapter 9. The depicted O-glycan contains a typical core structure (one of four common cores) that begins at the reducing end with an N-acetylgalactosamine α-linked to a serine or threonine (GlcNAcβ1-6[Galβ1-3]GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). It begins as a biantennary structure but can be further extended toward the nonreducing end to form more complex structures. The synthesis and biological importance of O-glycans are described in Chapters 10 (O-GalNAc) and 19 (O-GlcNAc). Examples of branched structures in N- and O-linked glycans.'
 'Branching is a prime characteristic of many glycans found on mammalian cell surfaces. Glycans representing two major types of eukaryotic protein glycosylation are shown in Figure 3.1. An N-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the side-chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue that is a part of a consensus peptide sequence NX(S/T). An O-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the terminal oxygen of a serine or threonine residue. N-Glycans contain a core composed of three mannose residues and two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Manα1-6[Manα1-3]Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-N-Asn). The depicted glycan is a biantennary glycan with branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain.'
 'The density of glycans in the glycocalyx can be remarkably high. For example, it has been calculated that the concentration of sialic acids in the glycocalyx of a typical human B lymphocyte may be >100 mm.

These (more...) Nucleotides and proteins are linear polymers that can each contain only one basic type of linkage between monomers.'
 'Also, the many hydroxyl groups of the other sugar permit several possible regioisomers. Two glucose residues, for example, can be joined together in numerous ways, as illustrated by maltose (Glcα4Glc) and gentiobiose (Glcβ6Glc) (Figure 2.14). These isomers have very different three-dimensional structures and biological activities. A monosaccharide can engage in more than two glycosidic linkages, thus serving as a branchpoint. The common occurrence of branched sequences (as opposed to the linear sequences that are found in almost all peptides and oligonucleotides) is unique to glycans and contributes to their structural diversity. Two isomeric disaccharides.  The relationship of the glycosidic bond to oligosaccharides is analogous to the relationship of the amide bond to polypeptides and the phosphodiester bond to polynucleotides.'
 'Examples of branched structures in N- and O-linked glycans.  Both glycans depicted are terminated with a sialic acid (often Neu5Ac in humans) at their nonreducing end. Sialylation is characteristic of mammalian glycans and important for immune response. In protein–glycan interactions, not only are particular residues recognized, but often their position in a branching structure is recognized as well. An interesting example is the interaction of the enzyme that adds the 2-6-linked sialic acids to the termini of N-glycans. It has a high preference for adding to the 1-3-linked branch (by more than an order of magnitude) despite the fact that the residues on both branches are identical back to the mannose at the branch point (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα-). This may give some indication of the extent to which branching plays a role in recognition processes. Unique among mammals are free oligosaccharides present in milk.'
 '(A) Newman projection along the C1—O1 bond illustrating φ for the 1-6 glycosidic bond. (B) Newman projection along the C6′—O1 (more...) Glycans are linked to other biomolecules, such as lipids or amino acids within polypeptides, through glycosidic linkages to form glycoconjugates (see Chapters 9, 10, 11, and 12). Glycans are often referred to as the glycone of a glycoconjugate and the noncarbohydrate component is named the aglycone. The glycan may be a mono- or an oligosaccharide. In conclusion, monosaccharide building blocks can be linked to various regio- and stereochemistries, and the resulting oligosaccharides can be assembled on protein or lipid scaffolds (see Chapter 3).'
 'These (more...) Nucleotides and proteins are linear polymers that can each contain only one basic type of linkage between monomers. In contrast, each monosaccharide can theoretically generate either an α- or a β-linkage to any one of several positions on another monosaccharide in a chain or to another type of molecule. Thus, whereas three different nucleotides or amino acids can only generate six trimers, three different hexoses could theoretically produce (depending on which of their forms are considered) anywhere from 1056 to 27,648 unique trisaccharides. This difference in complexity becomes even greater as the number of monosaccharide units found in natural glycan increases (now numbering in the hundreds). Fortunately for the student of glycobiology, naturally occurring biological macromolecules in a given species tend to contain relatively few of the possible monosaccharide units, and they are in a limited number of combinations.']",Biantennary glycans have branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain. These glycans typically contain a core structure that begins at the reducing end with a specific linkage to a serine or threonine residue. The structure can be further extended towards the nonreducing end to form more complex structures.,"N-glycans of the hybrid and complex type may exist with two or more GlcNAc-bearing branches that are referred to as antennae. In forming multi-antennary N-glycan structures, GlcNAc residues may be added to the trimannosyl core by six different GlcNAc transferases (I–VI). Up to five branches have been observed on N-glycans of some vertebrate glycoproteins.",1.0,0.8872517532471158,0.7080728856859546,0.023255813953488372,0.5666666666525,0.6666666666666666
What functions do biantennary N-glycans typically serve?,"['Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain. This becomes particularly evident when recombinant glycoprotein molecules are produced in biotechnology, bearing different glycosylation patterns based on the evolutionary history of the cell expression system in use (bacterial, yeast, insect, nonhuman mammal, or human). The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells. In the embryonic state, or in other states of neural “plasticity,” polySia chains tend to be long, thereby interfering with homophilic binding (Chapter 15).'
 'A further structural function of glycans is to act as a protective storage depot (“sponge”) for biologically important molecules. For example, many heparin-binding growth factors (Chapters 17 and 38) bind glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of the extracellular matrix, adjacent to cells that need to be stimulated (e.g., in the basement membrane underlying epithelial and endothelial cells). This prevents diffusion of factors away from the site of secretion (sometimes generating morphogenic gradients), protects them from nonspecific proteolysis, prolongs their active lives, and allows them to be released under specific conditions. Likewise, GAG chains in secretory granules can bind and protect protein contents of the granule and modulate their functions. There are several other instances in which glycans act as sinks or depots for biologically important molecules, such as water, ions, and immune regulatory proteins.'
 'Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them. Biological functions of glycans can be divided into three broad categories: (1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs]) (Figure 7.1). The GBPs can be subdivided into two groups: (1) intrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from the same organism and (2) extrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from another organism. Intrinsic GBPs typically mediate cell–cell interactions or recognize extracellular molecules, but they can also recognize glycans on the glycocalyx of same cell.'
 'However, such glycans are now known to occur on some apparently unrelated proteins, for different functional roles. Likewise, the sialylated fucosylated lactosamines critical for selectin recognition (Chapter 34) are found in a variety of unrelated cell types in mammals, and the polySia chains that play an important part in embryonic nervous system neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) function (Chapter 15) are also found on a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) (CCR7) expressed in dendritic cells, where they appear to be important for targeting of these cells to the lymph nodes. Given that glycans are added posttranslationally, these observations should not be surprising. Once a new glycan or modification has been expressed in an organism, several distinct functions could evolve independently in different tissues and at different times in development. If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution.'
 'There are several other instances in which glycans act as sinks or depots for biologically important molecules, such as water, ions, and immune regulatory proteins. The asymmetry in localization of most glycans on the outer plasma membrane leaflet can contribute to a signal for the intracellular rupture of vesicles, wherein exposed glycans are detected by cytoplasmic lectins (e.g., galectins) and trigger autophagy. Polymerized glycans such as starch and cellulose (in plants) and glycogen (in animals) can serve a major role in nutrient storage and sequestration. The relative resistance to digestibility of the internal linkages of such polymers by enzymes of intrinsic or extrinsic origin determines their relative role as structural components or as a mechanism for nutrient sequestration. Flowering plants have evolved important glycan-based strategies for exploiting animal behavior by making available sucrose-rich rewards to pollinators and seed dispersers (nectar and fruit).'
 'These glycans have potent effects by favoring symbionts and blocking pathogenic microbes (bacteria and viruses) of the infant gut. Expression of certain glycans on different glycoconjugates in different tissues at different stages of development implies diverse roles for these glycan structures within the same organism. For example, Man-6-P-containing glycans were first found on lysosomal enzymes and are involved in lysosomal trafficking (Chapter 33). However, such glycans are now known to occur on some apparently unrelated proteins, for different functional roles.'
 'In many of these instances, the putative GBP receptors for these molecules and their precise mechanisms are still being defined. It is now clear that glycans have many specific information-bearing biological roles in cell–cell recognition and cell–matrix interactions. A well-characterized example is the selectin family of adhesion molecules. These cell-surface proteins recognize glycans on ligands and mediate critical interactions between and amongst blood cells and vascular cells in a variety of normal and pathological situations but are also involved in implantation of embryos on the endometrium (Chapter 34). Glycans and GBPs on cell surfaces can interact specifically with molecules in the matrix or even with glycans on the same cell surface (in cis). Some critical recognition sites are actually combinations of glycans and protein.']","Biantennary N-glycans typically serve structural roles, energy metabolism functions, and act as information carriers in biological systems.","Biantennary N-glycan structure with two terminal alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids is a common and optimal structure that is able to enhance the activities of antibodies against cancer, influenza, and inflammatory diseases.",0.0,0.8456068222594358,0.6675630584981578,0.02857142857142857,0.30952380950833336,0.0
"How does glycosylation affect the stability and function of therapeutic proteins, and what strategies are used to optimize glycan profiles?","['Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation. Sialidases and other glycosidases that are either secreted or released by dead cells can also degrade the previously intact product in the culture medium. These issues were hotly debated with the advent of “biosimilars” or generic versions of glycoproteins. The need to prove composition has fueled efforts devoted to glycan analysis and sequencing. Patenting new therapeutics is typically based on the composition of matter in the claimed molecule. Small molecules of defined structure and nonglycosylated proteins are easily captured in this manner.'
 'This suggests that one must consider all the known glycogenes in a mammalian cell line for glycoengineering strategies. Engineering the glycosylation capacity of CHO cells has also enabled more homogeneous bioconjugation of therapeutic drugs. For example, therapeutic drugs may be chemically conjugated with PEG chains to enhance circulatory half-life, but chemical conjugation is difficult to direct to specific sites in glycoproteins. A strategy for enzymatic modification of glycans postproduction has been developed that involves desialylation of recombinant glycoproteins, followed by in vitro transfer of a modified (PEGylated) Neu5Ac (as its CMP analog) to exposed Gal/GalNAc residues by a sialyltransferase. The process is in use with approved drugs, although heterogeneous modifications occur when multiantennary N-glycans are targeted.'
 'This is currently addressed by ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through the use of highly standardized bioprocessing protocols, but this strategy is far from optimal. For example, incompletely sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins may be cleared by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell–Morell receptor), resulting in inconsistent circulatory half-lives of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 34). Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sialylation by overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases as well as inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases in host cells. Protein-specific glycosylation patterns and heterogeneity are more difficult to control. Nonhuman mammalian cell lines can produce two immunogenic nonhuman glycans: α1-3-Gal added to N-acetyllactosamine and Neu5Gc added to Gal or GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 15).'
 'This chapter focuses on approaches and methods for designing glycosylation in cells, whereas other active areas of engineering glycans to produce structural bioproducts, foods, and fuels are not covered. Today, cellular glycoengineering is often used to produce recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins that require glycosylation for their efficacy and at the same time must have human-compatible glycosylation to avoid immune responses to nonhuman glycans. Glycosylation can alter the size, charge, and solubility of therapeutic glycoproteins to prevent rapid clearance from the circulation. In addition, glycoengineering has been used to improve or develop new therapeutic modalities (Chapter 57). Glycans can also serve as ligands for lectin receptors that target therapeutics to certain cells. Of particular importance is the role of N-glycosylation for effector functions of IgG antibodies; therapeutic IgG antibodies with N-glycosylation designed to improve their cytotoxic properties are in clinical use.'
 'Among the prerequisites for glycoengineering a desired glycan in a chosen host is that the appropriate repertoire of activated sugar donors and their transporters are present (Chapter 5). This is especially important when engineering glycosylation in prokaryotes or nonmammalian eukaryotes in which the nucleotide sugar donors required to synthesize therapeutics with human glycosylation may not be present. For example, yeast does not produce UDP-GalNAc, and many organisms do not produce CMP-sialic acids. Different genetic strategies may be used to alter the glycosylation capabilities of cells. Knockdown and nontargeted overexpression in eukaryotes have been used for many years, and precisely targeted gene editing strategies are now well-established. Reducing undesirable glycosyltransferase activities in cells has been achieved by gene silencing strategies.'
 'Reducing undesirable glycosyltransferase activities in cells has been achieved by gene silencing strategies. Whereas this has been particularly successful in plants and Drosophila, silencing has not gained wide use in glycoengineering mammalian cell lines because the low efficiency of knockdown often leaves undesirable levels of target glycosyltransferase activity remaining. Adding desirable glycosyltransferase activities to eukaryotic cells is achieved by transfection of glycogenes from any organism, random integration of plasmid DNA, and antibiotic selection of stable clones. Although this strategy is successful, it provides no control over site(s) of genomic integration (unless specific strategies are used), gene copy number, or gene expression levels. Overexpression of enzymes can lead to disruption of normal glycosylation patterns and unpredictable glycosylation. Instability of the introduced glycosylation genes and the use of antibiotics for selection have also been problematic for the long-term use of such engineered cells for production of therapeutic glycoproteins.'
 'The process is in use with approved drugs, although heterogeneous modifications occur when multiantennary N-glycans are targeted. CHO cells have now been engineered to produce monoantennary, unsialylated N-glycans, which circumvent heterogeneity while retaining multiple exposed Gal acceptor sites for sialo-PEGylation. Mammalian cells perform many different types of O-glycosylation (Figure 56.1), and although these exert diverse and important biological functions, the interest in O-glycans for recombinant therapeutics has been limited. Nevertheless, recombinant coagulation factors in clinical use carry O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, and/or O-Glc glycans, and many other approved drugs including erythropoietin and Enbrel have O-GalNAc glycans. O-GalNAc glycans are also used for site-specific bioconjugation.']","Glycosylation plays a crucial role in influencing the stability and function of therapeutic proteins. Changes in glycosylation patterns can impact the efficacy, circulatory half-life, and immune response of therapeutic glycoproteins. To optimize glycan profiles, various strategies are employed, such as controlling glycosylation during production to ensure batch-to-batch consistency, enhancing sialylation to prevent rapid clearance by receptors like the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases, inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases, and utilizing glycoengineering techniques to modify glycans postproduction. Additionally, efforts are made to engineer glycosylation in host cells by ensuring the presence of activated sugar donors, using gene editing strategies to alter glycosylation capabilities, and adding desirable glycosyltransferase activities through transfection and stable clone selection. These strategies aim to improve glycan profiles for therapeutic proteins, ensuring their stability and function for effective treatment.","Glycosylation can also enhance the stability of the protein therapeutic against proteolytic degradation, oxidation, precipitation, and denaturation. As glycosylation can shield hydrophobic regions on the glycoprotein’s surface, it can prevent protein aggregation, which can help decrease immunogenicity. Glycosylation can also hide immunogenetic protein epitopes on the glycoprotein’s surface. While glycosylation has many effects on glycoprotein drugs, it’s challenging to ensure that the final drug product has desired glycosylation patterns. The glycosylation patterns on a protein can be heterogeneous in terms of where the modification occurs and the modification itself.",1.0,0.8591496731034799,0.7816519136917823,0.025,0.9999999999857143,1.0
Can you explain the concept of glycan microarrays and their application in studying glycan-protein interactions?,"['Microarrays in which a variety of lectins and antibodies are printed on a slide can also give valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. This approach is especially sensitive in regard to defining whether biological samples differ in glycosylation. For example, such microarrays have been used to identify glycosylation differences in melanoma metastasis, leading to the identification of core fucose as a critical determinant of metastatic potential. There are several approaches to using antibodies and lectins in glycan purification, including affinity chromatography or affinity binding and immunoprecipitation or lectin-induced precipitation. The proteins may be covalently coupled to a carrier such as Sepharose or biotinylated and captured on streptavidin-Sepharose. In addition, antibodies may be noncovalently captured on protein A (or G)-Sepharose. These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants.'
 'The use of glass slides, microarray printing technology, and surface patterning of engineered glycophages displaying unique carbohydrate epitopes allows the production of glycan microarrays with the potential to examine binding of all types of GBPs (lectins, antiglycan monoclonal or serum antibodies, and glycan-binding cytokines or chemokines) to several thousand unique glycans, simultaneously. Binding is assessed by fluorescent or spectrometric techniques.'
 'Lectin precipitation and aggregation can be used to define the glycan composition and overall architecture of polysaccharides, as has been done for bacterial, algal, plant, and animal polysaccharides. Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. Fluorescent-tagged glycoproteins from a source (e.g., cell or tissue extracts) can be applied to these arrays and the binding pattern compared to a control sample can reveal features of the glycome of the material, such as patterns of sialylation, fucosylation, and even linkages of residues with glycans using linkage-specific reagents.'
 'The major limitations of this approach are that (1) it does not provide direct information about affinity constants or other thermodynamic parameters; (2) it can require relatively high amounts of GBP and glycans if used as a general screening array; and (3) it usually requires chemical derivatization of glycans or GBPs. Glycan microarrays are an extension of both ELISA-type formats and modern DNA and protein microarray technology. In a glycan microarray, glycans are linked, usually covalently, to a solid surface through reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-esters or epoxide-containing supports on a glass slide. Glycans are prepared to contain reactive primary amines at their reducing termini, but other chemical coupling methods are available. In addition, noncovalent immobilization can be used in which lipid-derivatized glycans or glycolipids are deposited onto nitrocellulose-coated slides.'
 'These arrays have allowed for rapid, high-throughput analysis of the binding specificities of numerous biologically important glycan-binding proteins, including lectins, antibodies, viruses, and bacteria. It has been estimated that these arrays will need to contain between 10,000 and 20,000 different glycans to cover most possible glycotopes (this highly conservative estimate does not take into account various common and labile modifications of glycans). In addition, more specialized arrays will be required to study glycan-binding proteins made by prokaryotes or to study proteins that bind to glycosaminoglycans, for example. Fortunately, the ability to make such large and diverse glycan arrays is on the horizon, and the remaining challenge will be to better understand the parameters of the glycan arrays, besides the glycans themselves, that influence binding, such as linkers, spacing, and density of glycans on solid supports. Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states.'
 'Binding is assessed by fluorescent or spectrometric techniques. Glycan microarray data are provided by resources such as the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics/publicdata/primaryscreen.jsp) and the Imperial College Microarray Data Online Portal (https://glycosciences.med.ic.ac.uk/data.html), and several analysis software packages, including GLAD (https://glycotoolkit.com/GLAD/), MotifFinder (https://haablab.vai.org/tools/), MCAW (https://mcawdb.glycoinfo.org/) and CCARL (https://github.com/andrewguy/CCARL). Note that arrays that use different linkers and/or different attachment chemistries can give quite variable results, and the results need to be evaluated in the context of natural binding phenomena. It has long been known that many viruses use host glycans as specific binding receptors for entering the cell (Chapter 37).'
 'This project aimed to deepen understanding of the function of carbohydrate–protein interactions on the cell surface and in cell–cell communication. The CFG generated diverse data sets of (1) gene expression of glycosyltransferases and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) from gene microarray experiments, (2) phenotypic analysis of transgenic mice, (3) mass spectrometric profiling of glycan structures isolated from selected cells and tissues, and (4) glycan affinity of proteins using glycan arrays. Several large-scale initiatives to organize and integrate various glycan-related information and resources have been launched in recent years. Among these, GlyGen, GlyCosmos, and Glycomics@Expasy present integrated portals to query diverse databases related to glycomics, genomics, and proteomics. In this regard, GlyGen retrieves carbohydrate- and glycoconjugate-related data from several international data sources and integrates and harmonizes them.']","Glycan microarrays are arrays where various glycans are immobilized on a solid surface, allowing for the simultaneous examination of interactions between these glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) such as lectins, antibodies, viruses, and bacteria. These microarrays enable high-throughput analysis of binding specificities and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. By using fluorescent or spectrometric techniques to assess binding, researchers can study the binding patterns of different GBPs to a wide range of unique glycans, helping to elucidate the dynamics of glycan-protein interactions. Additionally, glycan microarrays can be used to explore the glycome of cells, identify glycosylation differences in biological samples, and investigate features such as sialylation, fucosylation, and linkages of residues with glycans.","Glycan microarrays consist of a panel of glycans immobilized on a microchip that can be used to evaluate binding specificity of glycan-binding proteins. This technology can be used in many specific services such as Glycoprotein Structure Analysis, Glycoprotein Quantification, High Throughput Glycan Screening Service, Tumor Glyco-diag Service, and Anti-Glycoprotein Antibody Development.",1.0,0.8048844380230928,0.9125251635587784,0.0625,0.7345238095115675,0.5
"What are the computational methods available for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data, and what are their limitations?","['Ion mobility mass spectrometry additionally separates ions based on their size and shape which can resolve glycan structural isomers with the same mass to charge ratio (see Further Reading). Broadly speaking, the unique strengths of MS can be exploited in two general ways in glycobiology. The first is to obtain detailed characterization of purified individual glycans or mixtures of glycans. In this type of study, it is essential to acquire sufficient rigorous data to define structure unambiguously; many different MS-based experiments will be required, often complemented by NMR, linkage analysis, and profiling of enzyme digests. The second is to pursue glycomics investigations in situations in which it may not be essential to define structures fully, and high-throughput glycomic profiling or mass-mapping procedures in combination with specific glycosylhydrolases can be exploited (Chapter 51). NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of full de novo structural characterization of isolated glycans and simple glycan mixtures.'
 'In MS/MS experiments, permethylated derivatives form abundant fragment ions produced by cleavage at susceptible glycosidic linkages, notably on the reducing side of each HexNAc residue. In N- and O-glycans, this preferred fragmentation unambiguously establishes the antennae sequences. MALDI- and ESI-MS can equally be applied to the characterization of glycolipid and GAG derived glycans. However, in the latter case, because of the size and high degree of sulfation of GAGs, MS analysis is usually performed after hydrolysis of the polymeric chain. As described above, mass spectrometry measures the mass to charge ratio of glycans during the analytical process. However, as multiple monosaccharides that make up a glycan can have the same mass (e.g., mannose, galactose and glucose) and monosaccharides can be linked together in different ways, a single peak in a glycan mass spectrum can actually be made up of multiple structural isomers.'
 'NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of full de novo structural characterization of isolated glycans and simple glycan mixtures. Among its several advantages are its broad applicability (glycans contain an abundance of hydrogen (1H), the most easily detected magnetic nucleus), its nondestructive nature, the quantitative relationship between resonance intensity and residue concentration, the diverse set of experiments available, and the ability to return information on primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Its principal limitation is sensitivity, typically requiring several nanomoles of glycan for even the simplest structure determination. Other limitations for both structural and metabolic applications are the relatively high cost of spectrometers and the level of expertise required for acquiring and interpreting NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there are emerging experiments using methods, such as dynamic nuclear polarization and looped, projected spectroscopy (L-PROSY), that provide several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for applications that can monitor rapid in vivo conversions of metabolites such as glucose and fructose.'
 'More recently both stepped-energy HCD, and ETD supplementation with HCD (EThcD) have emerged as powerful strategies for revealing both the composition of the attached glycans and the sites of glycosylation. The application of multiple fragmentation modes to a single candidate glycopeptide sets the stage for the development of glycoinformatics tools that may reveal some information on the attached glycan structure (in addition to composition) at specific sites. The mass spectrum matching algorithms used in these programs vary widely (e.g., database search, de novo sequencing/open-glycan searching, or spectral library matching) to identify specific spectral fragment masses and thereby assign glycan/glycopeptide structural features. Following the ability now to obtain large data sets on glycopeptides generated from complex mixtures of glycoproteins (Chapter 51), a bottleneck that has severely limited the field of glycoproteomics is the downstream glycopeptide structural identification. The identification process was, until recently, largely driven by manual expert annotation of the resulting MS/MS spectra.'
 'GlycoStore also provides access to CE migration data for a limited set of glycan structures. NMR data was obtained on carbohydrate structures in the 1980s and 1990s and is still the best analytical technique available to obtain complete structural information on purified oligosaccharides, but is less used now because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material from biological sources. The CASPER (Computer-Assisted Spectrum Evaluation of Regular Polysaccharides) program predicts 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of glycans. As such, it is used for determining the glycan structures based on experimental NMR data. Another area of software analysis of experimental data has been in mining glycan array data sets to identify glycan sequence motifs recognized by various GBPs, such as plant and animal lectins, viral and bacterial pathogen proteins, and antibodies.'
 'NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles.'
 'However, there may not be a need for de novo analysis of every single glycan in the future. Matching of fragment spectra using fragmentation libraries containing many of the more ubiquitously expressed glycans (Chapter 52) is becoming a pathway to quickly assign a majority of structures fully or partially and allows researchers to focus on validation of only the structures that are important for addressing the biological question. Similar to proteomics, automated glycan identification should ideally be performed with stringent confidence thresholds by, for example, determining the false discovery rate of the reported identifications. Novel fragmentation techniques, the introduction of ion mobility MS, and in vivo or in vitro incorporation of heavy isotopic monosaccharides or tags are starting to provide other opportunities for the isomeric glycan structural characterization, quantitation, and visualization that are currently lacking in glycomic mass spectrometric techniques. A key question that often follows the identification of important glycosylation features by glycomics is, which proteins carry the implicated glycan structures and at which sites?']","The computational methods available for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data include GlycoStore, CASPER (Computer-Assisted Spectrum Evaluation of Regular Polysaccharides), and software analysis of experimental data to mine glycan array data sets. These methods are used to determine glycan structures based on experimental NMR data and to identify glycan sequence motifs recognized by various glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). However, limitations of these computational methods include the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material from biological sources for NMR analysis, the complexity of preparing samples for investigation, and the challenge of accurately representing dynamic processes involving glycans, such as enzymatic conversions and glycan transport, using static structural models.","Currently, structural determination of glycans is, at best, semi-manual and proceeds structure by structure. Since different glycan structures can result in the same mass, structural isomers are routinely separated via liquid chromatography (LC), followed by fragmentation into smaller substructures by MS, conceptually akin to shotgun sequencing. Current in-depth workflows are hard to parallelize, with a general trade-off between resolution and scale. All this has relegated structural glycomics to a few experts, inaccessible to most life science researchers. Nuances of diagnostic indicators are challenging for humans to decrypt manually or encode programmatically, especially at scale and while accommodating diverse experimental setups, as each linkage and monosaccharide can be affected by its sequence context.",0.5,0.939978181597904,0.7358681992336834,0.07894736842105263,0.8734126983981415,0.0
"What are the structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines, and how does this binding regulate cellular signaling pathways?","['Indeed, few membrane receptors have been described in which sulfated GAGs binding causes a specific downstream response, such as phosphorylation of the receptor or activation of a kinase. Instead, sulfated GAGs bind to many ligand/receptor pairs, thereby lowering the effective concentration of ligand required to engage the receptor or increasing the duration of the response. An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase. These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix.'
 'Many other sulfated GAG-binding proteins were later discovered by affinity chromatography using columns of immobilized heparin. Growth factors and cytokines bearing clusters of positively charged amino acids along their protein surface interact with sulfated GAGs in a looser fashion—that is, they do not always show the high specificity seen with antithrombin. However, in some cases, specific GAG sequences mediate the formation of higher-order complexes, acting as a template for oligomerization or positioning of proteins such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its cell-surface receptor. GBPs function in communication between cells in multicellular organisms and in interactions between microbes and hosts and can also be involved in binding growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. These interactions can take various forms, resulting in movement of molecules, cells, and information. Directing movement of glycoproteins within and between cells is a common function for lectins in many organisms.'
 'Hyaluronan oligosaccharides bind to specific membrane proteins, including CD44. In some cells, this binding leads to clustering of CD44, which activates kinases such as c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 with regulatory and adaptor molecules that modulate cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell survival and proliferation (Figure 16.6). Signaling by hyaluronan oligosaccharides depends on the DP of the glycans. Low molecular weight glycans are more active in triggering danger responses via binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In contrast to hyaluronan-dependent signal transduction, signaling via sulfated GAGs such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate occurs by an indirect mechanism.'
 'With more than 500 GAG-binding proteins already identified (and still counting), we cannot help contemplating how this huge GAG interactome really functions at the system level. It is obvious that in any cellular environment, if one GAG-binding protein is found, it is likely that many more GAG-binding proteins are present as well. Do these GAG-binding proteins live in harmony, or are they in constant conflict by competing for binding to GAGs? When one GAG-binding protein is down-regulated, how would other GAG-binding proteins respond to this sudden availability of the free GAG-binding sites? Addressing these questions requires a systems biology approach, which has become possible with the recent increase in information about individual GAG–protein interactions. Given that spatiotemporal changes of GAG structure have profound impacts on the physiological processes associated with GAG-binding proteins, it would be natural to study this question using a systems biology approach. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Ryan Porell, Ulf Lindahl, and So Young Kim.'
 'These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix. Sulfated GAGs also facilitate the formation of morphogen gradients in tissues during early development. Because the gradient determines cell specification during development, the glycan indirectly affects signaling responses in receptive cells. These examples do not exclude the possibility that sulfated glycosaminoglycans may act as ligands and induce signaling directly (e.g., by ligating receptors). In addition to mucins (Chapter 10), the innate immune system developed early in eukaryote evolution is a first line of defense against infection by microorganisms. A key feature of this system is its ability to distinguish self from infectious nonself. In more advanced eukaryotes, this is accomplished by receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns specific to the pathogens. Many of these PAMPs are glycans located on the surfaces of the microorganism.'
 'Binding to GAGs can result in immobilization of proteins at their sites of production or in the extracellular matrix for future mobilization, regulation of enzyme activity, binding of proteins to their receptors, protein oligomerization, and protection of proteins against degradation. Several viruses and bacteria also exploit GAGs expressed in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces as attachment factors. For example, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, enters through the respiratory tract and infects epithelial cells lining the airways by interactions of the viral spike protein with heparan sulfate. The ability of virions to attach to cell-surface heparan sulfate facilitates capture of the virus and transfer to proteinaceous receptors (e.g., host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in the case of SARS-CoV-2) as well as subsequent viral glycoprotein processing and infection.'
 'In GAG-binding proteins, the protein usually binds to sugar residues that lie within the chain or near the terminus. Therefore, the binding sites in GAG-binding proteins consist of clefts or sets of juxtaposed surface residues rather than pockets. These GAG-binding sites on the protein surface give rise to more rapid GAG–protein binding kinetics than are typically observed for protein–protein interactions. Given that GAG chains generally exist in a helical conformation, only those residues on the face toward the protein interact with amino acid residues; the ones on the other side of the helix are potentially free to interact with a second ligand (e.g., as observed in FGF dimers). Alternatively, residues in a binding cleft could interact with both sides of the helix (e.g., in dengue envelope protein). Finally, one should keep in mind that binding occurs to only a small segment of the GAG chain.']","The structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines involve clusters of positively charged amino acids along the protein surface of these molecules. This interaction with sulfated GAGs occurs in a looser fashion compared to high specificity interactions seen with other proteins like antithrombin. Specific GAG sequences can mediate the formation of higher-order complexes, acting as a template for oligomerization or positioning of proteins such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its cell-surface receptor. This binding of GAGs to growth factors and cytokines can regulate cellular signaling pathways by facilitating communication between cells in multicellular organisms, interactions between microbes and hosts, and binding of various signaling molecules like growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines. These interactions can lead to movement of molecules, cells, and information, influencing processes such as cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly, cell survival, proliferation, and danger responses via Toll-like receptors (TLRs).","In general, the biological activity and binding affinity of GAGs is dictated by their sulfation pattern, disaccharide unit sequence and 3D conformation; however, GAGs are also capable of unspecific binding of other positively charged proteins due to the negative charge provided by their numerous sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. Many proteins also contain specific evolutionarily conserved GAG-binding domains that mediate specific protein-GAG interactions. These domains often contain basic amino acids with small polar side chains (i.e. lysine and arginine), allowing flexibility and minimal steric hindrance for interaction with GAGs.",0.6666666666666666,0.939794457191815,0.7718194646165596,0.023255813953488372,0.9999999999857143,0.25
"How does glycosylation impact the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, such as folding, stability, and oligomerization, and what are the implications for drug targeting?","['The expression of many of these proteins increases during stress responses. Unlike cytoplasmic proteins, most membrane and secreted proteins undergo modification with N-glycans (Figure 39.1) as they enter the ER lumen. Oligosaccharyltransferase requires flexible domains of a polypeptide for glycosylation, and thus N-glycosylation evolved in eukaryotes to occur before protein folding. Accordingly, N-linked glycans affect the folding of glycoproteins directly by altering the biophysical properties of the protein. They can serve as signals to localize the folding machinery and to signal the folding status of the polypeptide. To achieve glycan-mediated folding, N-glycans are recognized by two lectin-like chaperones in the ER: calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT).'
 'Some growth factor receptors acquire their binding abilities in a glycosylation-dependent manner while in transit through the Golgi apparatus. This may limit unwanted early interactions of a newly synthesized receptor with a growth factor that is synthesized in the same cell. Glycosylation of a polypeptide can also mediate an on–off switching effect. For example, when the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotrophin is deglycosylated, it still binds to its receptor with similar affinity, but it fails to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In most instances, the effects of glycosylation are incomplete; that is, glycosylation appears to be “tuning” a primary function of the protein rather than turning it on or off. For example, the activity of some glycosylated growth factors and hormones can be modulated over a wide range by the extent and type of their glycosylation. Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain.'
 'N-Butylation of deoxynojirimycin makes this glucosidase inhibitor an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis, which is discussed in more detail further below. In other cases, alkylation of the amino group or acylation of the hydroxyl groups can improve the potency of the compound, presumably by facilitating uptake across the plasma and Golgi membranes. Some of these compounds have shown positive effects for treating diabetes, cancer, HIV infection, and lysosomal storage diseases (see Chapter 57), but some also induce male sterility. A major challenge with all of these enzymes is their limited specificity; thus while convenient and widely used, some caution is needed when interpreting resulting observations. The importance of O-GlcNAc addition to many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) has stimulated interest in developing agents to inhibit its addition by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or its removal by O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]).'
 'Other glycan modifications also may affect glycoprotein folding in the ER. This chapter describes glycan-mediated quality-control processes in the ER and Golgi apparatus and what happens to glycoproteins that fail their “final folding examination.” During protein synthesis, nascent polypeptides begin to assume their final three-dimensional conformation by passing through folding intermediates dictated, to a large extent, by their primary sequence. Proper folding involves the formation of secondary structures (α-helices and β-strands), burying of hydrophobic residues in the interior of the protein, the formation of disulfide bonds, and quaternary associations via oligomerization or multimerization. Together, these processes prevent unwanted protein aggregation that would interfere with protein functions. To make folding more efficient, cells use various chaperones.'
 'Indeed, when some proteins are incorrectly glycosylated, they can fail to fold properly and/or to exit the ER. Such misfolded glycoproteins are translocated to the cytoplasm for degradation in proteasomes. Conversely, there are examples of glycoproteins whose synthesis, folding, trafficking, sensitivity to proteolysis, or immune recognition seem unaffected by altering their glycosylation. Moreover, inhibitors (Chapter 55) or genetic mutations (Chapter 45) that only affect later steps of glycan processing often do not interfere with basic structural functions. Although structural functions of glycans are obviously of great importance to the intact organism, they do not explain the evolution of such a diverse and complex range of molecules. A further structural function of glycans is to act as a protective storage depot (“sponge”) for biologically important molecules.'
 'Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms. They then make their way via an intermediate compartment (IC) through multiple stacks of the Golgi apparatus, finally being distributed to various destinations from the trans-Golgi network (TGN).'
 'Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation. Sialidases and other glycosidases that are either secreted or released by dead cells can also degrade the previously intact product in the culture medium. These issues were hotly debated with the advent of “biosimilars” or generic versions of glycoproteins. The need to prove composition has fueled efforts devoted to glycan analysis and sequencing. Patenting new therapeutics is typically based on the composition of matter in the claimed molecule. Small molecules of defined structure and nonglycosylated proteins are easily captured in this manner.']","Glycosylation impacts the biophysical properties of membrane proteins by directly affecting their folding, stability, and oligomerization. N-glycans, for example, play a role in modulating glycoprotein folding dynamics within the endoplasmic reticulum by altering the biophysical properties of the protein. They can also serve as signals to localize the folding machinery and signal the folding status of the polypeptide. Proper glycosylation can promote the proper folding of cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels, ensuring their stability and impacting their function. Additionally, glycosylation can influence the efficacy of drugs, making it crucial to control glycosylation during production to meet regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Understanding the impact of glycosylation on protein folding, stability, and function is important for drug targeting strategies and the development of therapeutics.","Glycosylation has been shown to ameliorate a multitude of pharmaceutically-relevant chemical and physical protein instabilities. Mechanistically, the different glycosylation parameters (e.g., number of glycans attached and glycan molecular size) studied so far can apparently impart different stabilization effects on the protein. While increasing the glycosylation degree apparently stabilizes the protein native state by increasing the internal non-covalent forces and rigidifying the protein structure, increasing the glycan molecular size appears to destabilize the protein unfolded state.",0.5555555555555556,0.8473857295352536,0.7445418297955957,0.04878048780487805,0.9999999999857143,0.3333333333333333
Explain the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition,"['Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses. Perhaps not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved this state of molecular mimicry by making use of “every possible trick in the book,” including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer. In some instances, the impact of the pathogen is aggravated by autoimmune reactions, resulting from host reactions to these self-like antigens.'
 'Likewise, various toxins bind with great specificity to certain gangliosides but not to the same glycan epitopes presented on proteins (Chapters 11 and 37). There is little doubt about the importance of structural specificity with respect to these functions of glycans. Indeed, some of the microbial binding proteins involved have been harnessed as molecular probes for studying the expression of their cognate glycans. However, providing such signposts to aid the success of pathogenic microorganisms has little obvious value to the organism that synthesized such glycans. To counter such deleterious consequences, some organisms have also evolved the ability to mask or modify glycans recognized by microorganisms or toxins. Meanwhile, glycan sequences on soluble glycoconjugates, such as secreted mucins, act as decoys for microorganisms and parasites. Thus, a pathogenic organism or toxin evolving to bind to mucosal cell membranes may first encounter its cognate ligand attached to a soluble mucin, which can then be washed away, removing the danger to cells underneath.'
 'This complex initiates a signaling cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately lead to the transcription of proinflammatory genes. In contrast to PAMPs and DAMPs, inhibitory Siglec receptors (Chapter 35) on mammal innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialylated glycoconjugates as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) and dampen unwanted immune reactions against the host. Details of the sialoglycan specificity involved require further investigation, but pathogens take advantage of the system via molecular mimicry (Chapters 7 and 42). Plants also exhibit a type of innate immunity that on activation could confer resistance to pathogen attack to the entire plant. Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops.'
 'As discussed in Chapter 34, many microbes and toxins bind to mammalian tissues by recognizing specific glycan ligands. Thus, small soluble glycans or glycan mimetics can be used to block the initial attachment of microbes and toxins to cell surfaces (or block their release), and thus prevent or suppress infection. Because many of these organisms naturally gain access through the airways or gut, the glycan-based drugs can be delivered directly without being distributed systemically. Milk oligosaccharides are natural antagonists of intestinal infection in infants (see above). Glycosylated polymers block the binding of viruses such as influenza. Although backed by a strong scientific rationale and robust in vitro studies, such “antiadhesive” or “mimicry” therapies have not yet found much practical application. When specific glycan-protein interactions are responsible for selective cell–cell interactions and a resulting pathology, then administration of small-molecule glycomimetics of the natural ligand is a useful means of intervention.'
 'These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix. Sulfated GAGs also facilitate the formation of morphogen gradients in tissues during early development. Because the gradient determines cell specification during development, the glycan indirectly affects signaling responses in receptive cells. These examples do not exclude the possibility that sulfated glycosaminoglycans may act as ligands and induce signaling directly (e.g., by ligating receptors). In addition to mucins (Chapter 10), the innate immune system developed early in eukaryote evolution is a first line of defense against infection by microorganisms. A key feature of this system is its ability to distinguish self from infectious nonself. In more advanced eukaryotes, this is accomplished by receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns specific to the pathogens. Many of these PAMPs are glycans located on the surfaces of the microorganism.'
 'Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain. This becomes particularly evident when recombinant glycoprotein molecules are produced in biotechnology, bearing different glycosylation patterns based on the evolutionary history of the cell expression system in use (bacterial, yeast, insect, nonhuman mammal, or human). The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells. In the embryonic state, or in other states of neural “plasticity,” polySia chains tend to be long, thereby interfering with homophilic binding (Chapter 15).'
 'Intrinsically low site affinity can sometimes be overcome using a multivalent form of the cognate glycan. Finally, especially when studying complex multicellular systems, introduced glycans could be cross-recognized by other known or unknown binding proteins, giving a confusing phenotypic readout. A powerful approach is the use of degradative enzymes known to be highly specific for a particular glycan sequence. Many such specific enzymes can be obtained from microbial pathogens. The advantage of this approach lies in eliminating certain structures selectively after normal synthesis has been completed rather than interfering with the biosynthetic cellular machinery. Thus, for example, sialidase treatment abolished lymphocyte binding to the high endothelial venules of lymph nodes and provided the first indication of endogenous ligands for L-selectin (Chapter 32); injection of endoneuraminidase into the developing retina suggested specific roles for polySias (Chapter 15); and injection of heparanase into developing embryos gave randomization of left–right axis formation (Chapter 17).']","Glycan shielding against immune recognition is significant as pathogens can evade host immune responses by decorating themselves with glycan structures that mimic those on host cell surfaces. This molecular mimicry can block the recognition of antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and even lead to autoimmune reactions. Additionally, organisms have evolved the ability to mask or modify glycans recognized by microorganisms or toxins, as well as use soluble glycoconjugates like mucins as decoys for pathogens. By shielding themselves with glycans, pathogens can avoid immune detection and enhance their ability to infect host cells.","Glycan shielding is utilized by some enveloped viruses to evade immune system targeting by their host. These viruses typically adopt host gylcosylation during synthesis of the protein envelope, allowing antigens to be modified so that host antibodies are unable to recognize them, thereby preventing immune response to viral infection. As a result, some organisms develop antibodies that specifically target foreign glycoproteins in order to identify pathogens that may have adopted glycosylation patterns from another individual.",0.8,0.9410294237463374,0.8297829058687519,0.023255813953488372,0.9999999999857143,0.3333333333333333
How is hemoglobin involved in glycan biosynthesis?,"['These modified proteins are thought to underlie some of the pathologies associated with diabetes. Two monosaccharide units can be joined together by a glycosidic bond—this is the fundamental linkage among the monosaccharide building blocks found in all oligosaccharides. The glycosidic bond is formed between the anomeric carbon of one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group of another. In chemical terms, a hemiacetal group reacts with an alcohol group to form an acetal. Glycosidic bonds can be formed with virtually any hydroxylated compound, including simple alcohols such as methanol (Figure 2.13) or hydroxy amino acids such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Indeed, glycosidic linkages are formed between sugars and these amino acids within proteins to form glycoproteins (see Chapters 9 and 10).'
 'Biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan begins with the transfer of GlcNAc-phosphate, derived from a nucleotide-activated precursor, onto an unusually short and highly saturated Dol-PP lipid carrier by AglH, a UDP-GlcNAc-1-P: Dol-P-GlcNAc-1-P transferase. Information concerning addition of the second and third sugars is lacking. However, Agl3 converts UDP-glucose and sodium sulphite into UDP-sulfoquinovose, which is subsequently added to Dol-PP-bound trisaccharide by an unknown glycosyltransferase. In the final steps of N-linked glycan assembly, the terminal mannose and glucose moieties are added, with Agl16, a soluble glycosyltransferase, adding the final glucose. A so-far unidentified flippase translocates the Dol-PP-bound hexasaccharide across the membrane, where AglB transfers the glycan to target protein Asn residues. In contrast to Hfx.'
 'Depending on the strain, this modification can be extended into longer structures containing GlcNAc or glucose/galactose residues. These glycoproteins are exported by an accessory secretion (SecA2/Y2) system and the glycan modification appears to play a role in modulating the adhesive properties of the bacterium. Haemophilus influenzae also modifies high molecular weight adhesions 1 (HMW1) prior to export. HMW1 is modified at some 31 asparagine residues, predominantly in the N-X-S/T amino acid motif, with mono- or dihexose modifications containing glucose and galactose. Glycosylation is initiated and extended by HMW1C (NGT), an enzyme with homology to the O-GlcNAc transferase. Of note, HMW1C uses UDP-Glucose and UDP-Galactose to initiate and extend glycans in a stepwise manner.'
 'The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases.'
 'One example is the interaction of heparin with antithrombin and thrombin. In this complex, one part of the heparin chain interacts with antithrombin, and another part of the heparin chain interacts with thrombin. Between the antithrombin-binding domain and thrombin-binding domain, a linker of six to seven saccharide residues exists. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, the biosynthesis of GAGs is not regulated by a well-defined template. Instead, each member of the GAG family is synthesized by a unique pathway (Chapter 17). The HS synthesis pathway, for example, involves multiple enzymes, including specific glycosyltransferases (or HS polymerase), an epimerase, and several sulfotransferases.'
 'Thus, research aimed at understanding the biological roles and consequences of glycan structures depends on the availability of integrated glycoinformatics databases. A consortium of international scientists under the GlySpace Alliance have made considerable progress in this area in recent years to streamline the annotation of glycans and related expression patterns such that they can be linked across diverse databases. Thus, a clearer path from glycan structure to biosynthetic pathways is beginning to emerge from these efforts. Interpreting glycan structural information in the context of diverse types of biological and chemical information is a challenge. For example, most glycans in animals are covalently linked to proteins or lipids. The glycan moieties of a glycoprotein are linked to specific amino acids (usually asparagine, serine, or threonine) (Chapters 9 and 10). Which sites are glycosylated and which structures are present at a particular site often vary, depending on many factors, including the type, developmental stage, and disease state of the cell or tissue.'
 ""Furthermore, glycans are often highly branched and their structures cannot be described as a simple linear sequence (Chapter 3). The critical role of glycomics in systems biology. Glycan structures have no template from which to be predicted, are regulated by cellular metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and modify both proteins and lipids. Glycomics thus requires the tools (more...) Because of this biosynthetic and structural complexity, it is not currently possible to accurately predict the structures of the glycans that an organism can produce under different environments or how these glycans are conjugated with other molecules, armed only with knowledge of the genome or proteome. Rather, the identity of each glycan in a biological sample must be identified using analytical methods (Chapter 50 and Chapter 51) that are sufficiently sophisticated to detect and discern the glycan's diverse structural features. Thus, research aimed at understanding the biological roles and consequences of glycan structures depends on the availability of integrated glycoinformatics databases.""]",Hemoglobin is not directly involved in glycan biosynthesis.,Hemoglobin is involved in oxygen transport and does not participate in glycan biosynthesis.,1.0,0.9219618621725353,0.8823536178887732,0.023809523809523808,0.49999999995,0.0
Does glycan synthesis occur in the mitochondria or the nucleus?,"['Similar studies have documented the presence of nuclear mannosyltransferases. The finding that CMP (cytidine 5′-monophosphate)-sialic acid is synthesized in the mammalian nucleus offers further support for the concept of nuclear glycosyltransferases. Although these studies are provocative, they must also be interpreted with caution. The rER, which is the widely accepted site of N-glycosylation (Chapter 9), is functionally contiguous with the outer nuclear envelope, which also can fold into the interior. Even a minor contamination of nuclear envelope could lead to misinterpretation of enzyme assays. Also, it is very difficult to purify nuclei such that other cellular components do not nonspecifically adhere to the otherwise “pure” nuclei during their preparation. Given these potential problems, widespread acceptance of the existence of these nuclear glycosyltransferases must await independent confirmation by alternative methods.'
 'A classical model envisioned that these enzymes are physically lined up along this pathway in the precise sequence in which they actually work. This model appears to be oversimplified, as there is considerable overlap in the distribution of these enzymes, and the actual distribution of a given enzyme depends on the cell type. All topological considerations mentioned above are reversed with regard to nuclear and cytoplasmic glycosylation, because the active sites of the relevant glycosyltransferases face the cytosol, which is in direct communication with the interior of the nucleus. Until the mid-1980s, the accepted dogma was that glycoconjugates occurred exclusively on the outer surface of cells, on the internal (luminal) surface of intracellular organelles, and on secreted molecules. The cytosol and nucleus were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. However, it is now clear that certain distinct types of glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within the cytosol and nucleus (Chapter 18).'
 'Almost all donors for glycosylation reactions and glycan modifications are synthesized within the cytosolic compartment, from precursors of endogenous origin. In eukaryotes, most of these donors are actively transported across a membrane bilayer by specific multipass transporter proteins, becoming available for reactions within the lumen of the ER–Golgi pathway. For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments. Indeed, one of them (O-linked GlcNAc; Chapter 19) may well be quantitatively the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cells.'
 'Interestingly, NGLY1 is essential for mitochondrial turnover via mitophagy, although evidence suggests it functions via a role other than deglycosylating mitochondrial proteins. If these processes do not operate on a given protein, because the N-glycan is modified in such a way that it is not recognized or is sequestered in a protein complex or the nucleus, then it may accumulate in the cytoplasm and potentially execute a novel function that might depend on its ER-derived glycan. In addition, there is evidence that endocytosed proteins, such as cholera toxin, can access the rER via retrograde transport and then enter the cytoplasm via retrotranslocation or a related process. Other studies suggest that glycoproteins conventionally secreted or transported to the plasma membrane have the potential to later move to the nucleus (Figure 18.1I). This includes cytokines, growth factors, and sometimes their transmembrane receptors, some of which have been reported to exert direct effects on transcription.'
 ""More recent cell biological studies emphasize intracellular connections between mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) elements of the secretory pathway. This might explain a pioneering observation that two nuclear-encoded mitochondrial glycoproteins appear to be conventionally N-glycosylated in the rER based on pulse-chase labeling studies and susceptibility to N-glycanase (Figure 18.1J). Indeed, lectin-binding studies suggest that mitochondria contain complex glycoconjugates. In Ewing's sarcomas, the plasma membrane protein MRP-1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1) is glycosylated and localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane and could play a role in drug resistance.""
 'A distinct example of glycosylation has been described on parafusin, a cytoplasmic protein from the phosphoglucomutase family, in several eukaryotes. Evidence suggested that this protein possesses a Glcα1-PO4-Man- linkage, and data were provided for glucose phosphotransferase and Glc-1-phosphate phosphodiesterase activities in cytosolic extracts. However, little is known about the enzymes that catalyze these modifications or the specific structures themselves. A possible mechanism for the occurrence of nuclear O-glycans in the nucleus is if the enzymes that are normally in the secretory pathway gain access to the nucleus or cytoplasm (Figure 18.1F). For example, several reports describe glycosyltransferase activities in highly purified preparations of rat liver nuclei judged to be >99% pure by marker enzyme analysis.'
 'The nucleotide sugar donors are synthesized within the cytosolic or nuclear compartment from monosaccharide precursors of endogenous or exogenous origin and then actively transported across a membrane bilayer into the lumen of the ER and Golgi compartments (Chapter 5). Notably, the portion of the glycoconjugate that faces the inside of these compartments will ultimately face the outside of the cell or the inside of a secretory granule or lysosome and will be topologically unexposed to the cytosol. The biosynthetic enzymes (glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, etc.) responsible for catalyzing these reactions are well studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. A classical model envisioned that these enzymes are physically lined up along this pathway in the precise sequence in which they actually work.']",Glycan synthesis occurs in the nucleus.,"Glycan synthesis takes place primarily in the Golgi Apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum.

Which glycosidases are involved in glycosylating p53?,"['Hypomorphic mutations in multiple genes in the pathway lead to a partial reduction in GPI-anchored proteins. These include PIGA, PIGH, PIGQ, PIGY, PIGC, PIGP, PIGL, PIGW, PIGM, PIGV, PIGB, PIGF, and PIGO in GPI-anchor assembly (Table 45.1), and PIGK, GPAA1, PIGS, PIGT, and PIGU in the transfer of the GPI anchor to proteins. Defects in side-chain modifications (PIGN and PIGG) and maturation of the GPI glycan following attachment to proteins (PGAP1, PGAP2, and PGAP3) also cause inherited GPI deficiency, but not embryonic death.'
 'Disaccharides that can enter the cell and act as decoys to divert glycosylation pathways are also showing promise (Chapter 55). Recently, there has been growing interest in targeting glycan-dependent molecular interactions to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition. N-glycosylation is important for stabilization of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule, as well as recognition by PD-1. Thus, therapeutic interference with PD-L1 glycosylation could provide a mechanism for hindering the activation of PD-1 on immune cells. The sialoglycan–Siglec interaction represents another critical immune checkpoint, and function-blocking antibodies against select Siglecs have entered clinical trials. Additionally, methods are being developed to block or ablate tumor cell Sia ligands for Siglecs via administration of sialic acid mimetics or the targeted delivery of sialidases to tumor cell surfaces.'
 'Loss-of-function mutations in the FGE gene lead to inactive sulfatases. This deficit affects GAG degradation and any other sulfated glycan such as sulfatides. Glycosphingolipids (Chapter 11) are degraded from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases while they are still bound to the lipid moiety ceramide. Because glycosphingolipids share some of the same outer sugar sequences found in N- and O-glycans (Chapter 14), many of the same glycosidases are used for their degradation (Figure 44.4). However, specific hydrolases cleave the glucose–ceramide and galactose–ceramide bonds. Besides specific enzymes, noncatalytic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) help to present the lipid substrates to enzymes for cleavage.'
 'Other mutants have been obtained by sorting cells that do not bind to a fluorescent antibody or with bacterial toxins that bind GPI glycans. The GPI-anchor mutants obtained to date fall into many genetic complementation groups, each having a different lesion in GPI-anchor biosynthesis (Chapter 12). These mutants reveal the complexity of GPI-anchor biosynthesis: Multiple gene products are involved in forming the N-acetylglucosamine linkage to phosphatidylinositol, the first committed intermediate in the pathway; dolichol-P-Man is used as the donor of Man; at least three enzymes are involved in the attachment of ethanolamine phosphate residues; and five genes are required for the transfer of the GPI anchor to protein. The available strains show the importance of genetic approaches for identifying genes that might not be obvious from measuring biosynthetic reactions in vitro. A large collection of mutants defective in GAG/proteoglycan biosynthesis has been isolated (Table 49.3).'
 'Additionally, O-GlcNAcylation regulates glycolysis in cancer cells via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) transcription factor. Many oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, NF-κB/p65, PFK1, SNAIL, Rb, and p53, are O-GlcNAcylated. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified many alterations in expression of glycosylation genes that correlate with cancers. The mechanistic basis is known in some cases. For instance, the transcription of MGAT5 (Figure 47.1) is induced by v-src, H-ras, and v-fps and the transcription factor ets-1. ST6GAL1 is likewise up-regulated by oncogenic ras isoforms, as well as through gene amplification.'
 'Unlike the glycosyltransferases, members of this family have evolved independently many times, a fact reflected in the diverse array of three-dimensional structures observed for these enzymes. Glycosidases play important roles in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars and for the turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes. Glycosidases are also involved in the formation of intermediates that are used as substrates for glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of glycans. The use of glycosidases in this way is particularly important in the biosynthesis of N-glycan-containing glycoproteins in more evolutionarily advanced eukaryotes and is thought to be associated with the acquisition of complex N-glycans during the evolution of multicellular organisms.'
 'In some cases, gangliosides are also major carriers of modified Sias (Figure 47.3). Cell culture studies suggest that some gangliosides promote tumor cell growth and invasion. As a principal constituent of lipid raft membrane microdomains, gangliosides modulate cell signaling by numerous receptors. Additionally, gangliosides shed by some tumors appear to have immunosuppressive effects. A complete loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins is seen in some cases of malignant and premalignant states involving the hematopoietic system. This results from acquired mutations in hematopoietic stem cells in the PIGA gene (required for an early step in GPI-anchor biosynthesis [Chapter 12]). Conversely, some GPI-anchored proteins, such as members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, like CEACAM5 (CEA), are overexpressed in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, and female reproductive system, among others.']",Glycosidases are involved in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars and for the turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes.

 'GlycoStore also provides access to CE migration data for a limited set of glycan structures. NMR data was obtained on carbohydrate structures in the 1980s and 1990s and is still the best analytical technique available to obtain complete structural information on purified oligosaccharides, but is less used now because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material from biological sources. The CASPER (Computer-Assisted Spectrum Evaluation of Regular Polysaccharides) program predicts 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of glycans. As such, it is used for determining the glycan structures based on experimental NMR data. Another area of software analysis of experimental data has been in mining glycan array data sets to identify glycan sequence motifs recognized by various GBPs, such as plant and animal lectins, viral and bacterial pathogen proteins, and antibodies.'

This collaborative, international bioinformatic integration of complex molecular data from all types of glycoanalytical techniques and interactions is in constant development and is essential for the continued progress of glycobiological research. Systems biology involves the development, simulation, and analysis of biological systems (including whole-body and environmental systems) at the molecular and cellular levels.

 'These unique identifiers, however, provide the semantic foundation required for individuals or databases to effectively communicate by recording the identifier of the structures they have characterized. Many advances in glyco-related databases and informatics tools development have focused on the interpretation and storage of analytical data, including liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), interaction arrays, mass spectrometry (MS), and three-dimensional (3D)/modeling/nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table 52.2). Glycoinformatics data analysis software tools  Most efforts so far have focused on tools that assist the interpretation of MS data. A number of commercial and publicly accessible software are now available. Introduced in 1999, the widely used GlycoMod was the first glycoinformatics Web-based tool to be released in this context, and its function is to suggest possible glycan compositions from experimental mass values of either free or derivatized glycans or glycopeptides.'
 'NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles.']","Computational methods for predicting glycan structure based on a DNA sequence involve utilizing tools such as neural networks, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and support vector machines (SVMs).

Why do plants and animals express similar repetoires of glycans despite their vastly different physiology?,"['If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species.'
 'For many taxa, there is a lack of any information on glycan profiles. Sufficient data are available to indicate that even though all living cells require a glycocalyx (a dense and complex array of cell-surface glycans), there is no evidence for a universal “glycan code,” akin to the genetic code. Importantly, glycan structures are not directly encoded in the genome. They are synthesized and modified by a network of enzymes in a template-independent manner, and glycophenotypes represent the outcome of co-expressed gene networks and nutrients. Glycans expressed by most free-living Bacteria (Eubacteria) and Archaea have relatively little in common with those of eukaryotes. They contain a much larger number of monosaccharide types and include many glycans exclusive to such microbes. In contrast, most major glycan classes in animal cells seem to be represented in some related form among other eukaryotes, and sometimes in Archaea.'
 'Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target.'
 'Flowering plants have evolved important glycan-based strategies for exploiting animal behavior by making available sucrose-rich rewards to pollinators and seed dispersers (nectar and fruit). Many animal species have secondarily evolved strategies to store collected nectar (bees and honey pot ants). Flowering plants have also evolved countless ways of storing starch and other polysaccharide nutrients in the endosperm of their seeds, as a way to give the next generation a head start. The first intrinsic animal glycan receptors (GBPs) identified in vertebrates were those mediating clearance, turnover, and intracellular trafficking of soluble blood-plasma glycoproteins (Chapters 33 and 34), specifically recognizing certain terminal or subterminal glycans on the circulating glycoprotein. However, even the most precise examples, such as the role of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes (Chapter 33), feature exceptions.'
 'These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow. Glycosylation in Bacteria and Archaea is far more diverse, both in terms of the range of monosaccharides used or synthesized, and in the types of linkages and modifications (Chapters 21 and 22). In addition, prokaryotic cell–cell interactions both within and between species are often mediated by glycans. However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity.'
 'In contrast, most major glycan classes in animal cells seem to be represented in some related form among other eukaryotes, and sometimes in Archaea. Figure 20.1 shows a circular depiction of the phylogeny of cellular life on earth. The rich glycan diversity encountered in the best-studied vertebrate species suggests similar diversity in other groups of organisms, and existing information points to complicated patterns. On the one hand, glycan patterns can form “trends” and characterize entire phylogenetic lineages, wherein one encounters further biochemical variation with subsets unique to certain sublineages. Conversely, many glycans show discontinuous distribution across phyla and distantly related organisms can produce surprisingly similar glycans, using either shared, ancient pathways or convergently (independently) evolved mechanisms. Circular depiction of phylogeny of cellular forms of life on earth. The lines inside the circle represent all 2.3 million species that have been named.'
 'In contrast, bacterial sialyltransferases bear little resemblance to those of eukaryotes, and the vast sequence differences between different bacterial sialyltransferases indicate that these have even been reinvented on several separate occasions. Of course, lateral gene transfer is common among Bacteria and Archaea, facilitating rapid phylogenetic dissemination of such enzymatic “inventions.” Why do closely related species differ with regard to the presence or absence of certain glycans? Does the same glycoprotein have the same type of glycosylation in distinct but related species? Relatively little data exist regarding these issues, but examples of both, extreme conservation and diversification are found. A reasonable explanation is that conservation of glycan structure reflects specific functional constraints for the glycans in question. In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral).']","Plants and animals express similar repertoires of glycans despite their vastly different physiology due to the conservation of core glycan structures across species, as well as the evolutionary pressures that drive the selection of certain glycan structures.
