 'With ongoing sequencing of numerous genomes, spectacular gains in understanding the biology of nucleic acids and proteins have occurred. Thus, many scientists assume that studying just these molecules will explain the makeup of cells, tissues, organs, physiological systems, and intact organisms. In fact, making a cell requires many small molecule metabolites as well as two other major classes of macromolecules—lipids and carbohydrates—which serve as intermediates in generating energy and as signaling effectors, recognition markers, and structural components. Taken together with the fact that they encompass some of the major posttranslational modifications of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates help explain how the relatively small number of genes in the typical genome can generate the enormous biological complexities inherent in the development, growth, and functioning of diverse organisms. The biological roles of carbohydrates are particularly prominent in the assembly of complex multicellular organs and organisms, which requires interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix.'
 'The major glycan classes discussed in the book are described, and an overview of the general pathways for their biosynthesis is provided. Topological issues relevant to biosynthesis and functions of glycoconjugates are also considered, and the growing role of these molecules in medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioenergy, and materials science is mentioned. Defined in the broadest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (also called carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature and of the proteins that recognize them. How does glycobiology fit into the modern concepts of molecular biology? The central paradigm driving research in molecular biology has been that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The power of this concept lies in its template-based precision, the ability to manipulate one class of molecules based on knowledge of another, and the patterns of sequence homology and relatedness that predict function and reveal evolutionary relationships.']","A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids).

 'Of course, the great majority of glycans in most species have yet to be discovered and structurally defined. Thus, much of the possible diversity may yet exist in nature. Although several hundred distinct monosaccharides are known in nature, only a minority of these are commonly found in well-studied glycans.

The cyclic form of a monosaccharide is characterized by a hemiacetal group formed by the reaction of one of the hydroxyl groups with the C-1 aldehyde or ketone.

"Complete the following paragraph: In solution, NMR studies show IdoA2S and IdoA residues to be present in a mixture of 1C4 and 2S0 conformations. The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins.","['Until now, only the 4C1 chair conformation has been verified experimentally for GlcA and GlcN in HS, but both the 1C4 chair and the 2S0 conformations have been found for IdoA2S residues in crystal structures containing HS.

A second factor contributing to structural diversity and selective interactions with certain HS-binding proteins is the size of the sulfated saccharide domains.'
 'In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding. IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind. Thus, the greater degree of conformational flexibility in these modified regions may explain why so many more proteins bind with high affinity to heparin, HS, and DS than to other GAGs. The presence of an N-acetyl group in an N-acetylglucosamine residue changes the preferred conformation of the neighboring IdoA residue, showing that even minor modifications can influence conformation and chain flexibility. Binding to GAGs that have a low degree of sulfation may require larger domains in the protein to interact with longer stretches of an oligosaccharide.'
 'Inspection of heparin oligosaccharides containing highly modified domains ([GlcNS6S-IdoA2S]n) shows that the N-sulfo and 2-O-sulfo groups of each disaccharide repeat lie on opposite sides of the helix from the 6-O-sulfo and carboxyl groups (Figure 38.1). Analysis of the conformation of individual sugars shows that N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid residues assume a preferred conformation in solution, designated 4C1 (indicating that carbon 4 is above the plane defined by carbons 2, 3, and 5 and the ring oxygen, and that carbon 1 is below the plane; Chapter 2). In contrast, IdoA2S assumes the 1C4 or the 2S0 conformation (Figure 38.1), which reorients the position of the sulfo substituents, thereby creating a different orientation of charged groups.']","In addition, the conformational flexibility of IdoA residues may also play a crucial role in mediating interactions with various proteins and enzymes involved in biological processes such as cell signaling, growth factor activity, and extracellular matrix organization. This dynamic behavior enables the sulfate groups on IdoA2S and IdoA residues to adopt optimal orientations for effective recognition and binding to specific protein targets, thereby modulating various cellular functions and signaling pathways.","Structural elements that dictate preferences for one form over the other, including the possible effects from the sulfated monosaccharide sequences around the IdoA/IdoA2S residue, are subject to further investigation.

HS isolated from natural sources shows domain-like structures, with clusters of six to eight saccharides forming the highly sulfated domains known as S-domains. These regions are separated by nonsulfated saccharide residues, consisting of GlcA-GlcNAc RUs, known as NAc-domains. The S-domains contain primarily IdoA residues that likely contribute the flexibility needed to optimize binding to proteins and elicit desired biological activities.",0.75,0.6707206004900467,0.6798458336030067,0.15384615384615385,0.9999999999666667,0.4

 'Thus, evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu. Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment.

 'The most abundant biopolymers in nature include secreted polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin, and glycosaminoglycans. These large, chemically stable molecules provide crucial structural support for capsules, cell walls, exoskeletons, and extracellular matrices of countless organisms. The repeated β1-4 glycosidic linkages of cellulose and chitin also represent chemically extremely resistant sequestrations of accumulated glycans, given the inability of most organisms to hydrolyze these robust linkages. Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution.

 'The nucleotide sugar donors are synthesized within the cytosolic or nuclear compartment from monosaccharide precursors of endogenous or exogenous origin and then actively transported across a membrane bilayer into the lumen of the ER and Golgi compartments (Chapter 5). Notably, the portion of the glycoconjugate that faces the inside of these compartments will ultimately face the outside of the cell or the inside of a secretory granule or lysosome and will be topologically unexposed to the cytosol. The biosynthetic enzymes (glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, etc.) responsible for catalyzing these reactions are well studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. A classical model envisioned that these enzymes are physically lined up along this pathway in the precise sequence in which they actually work.'
 'Almost all donors for glycosylation reactions and glycan modifications are synthesized within the cytosolic compartment, from precursors of endogenous origin.

For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments.

 'Like any biological system, the optimal approach carefully considers the relationship of structure and biosynthesis to function (Chapter 7). As might be imagined from their ubiquitous and complex nature, the biological roles of glycans are remarkably varied. Indeed, asking what these roles are is akin to asking the same question about proteins. Thus, all of the proposed theories regarding glycan function turn out to be partly correct, and exceptions to each can also be found. Not surprisingly for such a diverse group of molecules, the biological roles of glycans also span the spectrum from those that are subtle to those that are crucial for the development, growth, function, or survival of an organism (Chapter 7). The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions.'
 'Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them.

The GBPs can be subdivided into two groups: (1) intrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from the same organism and (2) extrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from another organism.

Therefore, during development and differentiation, and under different environmental conditions, the glycan repertoire of a cell represents a subset of all the glycans that an organism is capable of making. To describe this variation, it is common to qualify the term glycome when referring to the glycans made by a particular tissue or cell type (e.g., T-cell glycome, hepatocyte glycome, or serum glycome), and to note the particular stage of development (e.g., fetal liver glycome, breast cancer serum glycome).

Thus, variations in dietary monosaccharides, such as glucose, galactose, glucosamine, fucose, mannose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Chapter 15), may change the composition of the glycome. The numerous factors that influence the glycome (the transcriptome, the proteome, environmental nutrients, the secretory machinery, pH, and many other determinants) create a glycome that is highly diverse, adaptable, and dynamic. Thus, the glycome of a cell can change dramatically over time. It is this enormous structural plasticity in response to cellular and environmental states that underlies the essential roles of glycans in development, communication, and disease processes.'
 'Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27). The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward.']","The glycome is a crucial component of the molecular landscape within cells and plays a significant role in various biological processes. It is involved in cell-cell recognition, signaling, immune response modulation, and many other functions essential for cellular communication and homeostasis. Understanding the diversity and complexity of the glycome is essential for unraveling its roles in health and disease, as well as for developing potential therapeutic interventions targeting glycan-mediated processes.","The human and mouse glycomes have many glycan structures in common, but a few are unique or have divergent functional properties. For example, unlike humans, rodents synthesize cytidine monophospho-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Gc), for the transfer of Neu5Gc to N- and O-glycans (Chapter 15). Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26).",1.0,0.6735285115381106,0.5628561435600836,0.07142857142857142,0.9999999999666667,0.0

In particular, the sialylated and sulfated Lewis antigens are ligands for selectins (Chapter 34), and Gal-terminating structures are ligands for galectins (Chapter 36). Some sugar residues, or their modifications, may mask underlying antigens or receptors. For example, O-acetyl groups on the Sia of the sialyl-Tn antigen prevent recognition by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. Gut bacteria may actively remove this mask. Dense O-glycosylation of mucin domains provides almost complete protection from protease degradation. The O-linkage between GalNAc and Ser/Thr residues is labile under alkaline conditions.'

This chapter will largely deal with the biology, metabolism, and functions of Sias in mammals. The evolution, distribution, and functions of the larger family of NulOs are briefly described toward the end of this chapter.']","Sialic acids (Sias) are a family of acidic sugars that are typically found at the outermost ends of glycan chains on cell surfaces. They play crucial roles in various biological processes due to their unique properties, such as their electronegative charge. Sias are involved in functions such as repulsion of cell-cell interactions, protein stabilization, ion binding, and ion transport. The discovery of sialic acids dates back to the 1930s when Gunnar Blix isolated them from salivary mucins and Ernst Klenk from brain glycolipids. Blix named his discovery ""sialic acid"" after the Greek word for saliva (σíαλoν), while Klenk named his finding ""neuraminic acid"" in reference to neurons in the brain. Despite the eventual realization that these substances were the same, both names have persisted in the scientific literature.","Although 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sometimes called “NANA”) is the most common sialic acid (Sia) in humans, the Sia family is comprised of related structures (Figure 15.1) that vary at the C-5 carbon, including 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (also known as 3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid, or Kdn) with a hydroxyl group at C-5.

Hyal2-null mice and Tmem2-deficient zebrafish both suffer embryonic lethality as a result of cardiac developmental defects.'
 'Hyal2-null mice and Tmem2-deficient zebrafish both suffer embryonic lethality as a result of cardiac developmental defects. CEMIP is important for clearing hyaluronan accumulation during bacterial infection in mice. In humans, a lysosomal storage disorder was found to result from mutation of HYAL1 (Chapter 44). Hyaluronan fragments have been suggested to act as an endogenous signal of injury, or during infection by Group A Streptococcus, which contains a hyaluronan capsule. The signaling activity of hyaluronan fragments is mediated through binding of cell-surface receptors, such as CD44, which in turn modulates response through Toll-like receptors. Signaling through these and other receptors is affected by the size of the hyaluronan fragments, but the mechanism underlying the dependence of activity on the size of the fragments remains an area of active research. Hyaluronan has multiple roles in early development, tissue organization, and cell proliferation.'
 'Cytochemical studies using naturally occurring proteins with high-affinity binding to hyaluronic acid have been used to document accumulation of hyaluronic acid in the nuclei of cultured cells. In response to inflammatory conditions, such as hypoglycemia, cells appear to synthesize hyaluronan in intracellular compartments. After cell division, the intracellular hyaluronan is extruded outside cells in cables that recruit inflammatory cells initiating a stress response. Mechanistically, this is likely caused by a redistribution of the hyaluronan synthases to intracellular membranes from the plasma membrane, across which hyaluronic acid is normally extruded (Figure 18.1N). Notably, hyaluronic acid–binding proteins naturally occur within the nucleus raising the possibility of a physiological role for nuclear hyaluronan via interaction with these hyaluronic acid–binding proteins.']","Additionally, the internalization of hyaluronan can also occur through receptor-mediated endocytosis involving CD44, RHAMM, or LYVE-1, which are known to interact with hyaluronan and facilitate its uptake into the cell. Once internalized, hyaluronan can be degraded by lysosomal hyaluronidases, such as HYAL1 and HYAL3, releasing smaller hyaluronan fragments that can modulate various cellular processes and signaling pathways.","The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.",0.4,0.6765333873407362,0.6748094660893403,0.058823529411764705,0.99999999995,1.0

In general, phosphorylation and sulfation occur substoichiometrically, but phosphorylation may be transient.

The function of galactose sulfation in chondroitin sulfate remains unclear.'
 'Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF), a protein that lacks independent activity but collaborates with the polymerases to enhance the formation of polymers. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 17.5).

Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide.'
 'It has long been known that many viruses use host glycans as specific binding receptors for entering the cell (Chapter 37). Similarly, several viruses encode lytic enzymes that break down host cell surface glycans to release viral particles after viral replication. Genome sequencing reveals that many double-stranded DNA viruses also take advantage by adding sugars to host glycoproteins through the use of viral GTs (Chapter 42). Although biological roles of viral GTs are poorly understood, some functions have been identified. For example, the T4 bacteriophage encodes nucleases that degrade host cell DNA. To protect its own genome, the phage modifies its DNA by replacing cytosine with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and subsequently transferring glucose (Glc) to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine using a specific UDP-Glc:DNA Glc-transferase.'
 'The baculovirus enzyme ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase (EGT) disrupts the hormonal balance of the insect host by catalyzing the conjugation of ecdysteroid hormones with Glc or galactose (Gal). Expression of the EGT gene allows the virus to block molting and pupation of infected insect larvae. Similarly, Chloroviruses have enzymes in CAZy family GT4 for the glycosylation of their structural proteins. Serotype conversion in Shigella flexneri is mediated by temperate bacteriophages, which encode GTs that mediate O-antigen conversion by the addition of Glc to O-antigen units.

Others are natural targets of adaptive immunity and have been exploited in successful vaccine strategies. Because of their importance in cell viability, surface glycoconjugates are also frequent targets of antimicrobial strategies. This chapter will provide an overview of the structure and biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, together with some examples of their functions.

PLM antigens may be shed by C. albicans and, through interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLR-2), they can induce nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and cytokine responses such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. Galectin-3, a ubiquitous member of the galectin family of lectins that is highly expressed in macrophages, also appears to recognize C. albicans expressing β1-2-linked mannose residues, resulting in opsonization of the yeast. A. fumigatus is an environmental mold that spreads by airborne particles.']","One of the key factors contributing to the virulence of A. fumigatus is its complex cell wall composition, which includes a variety of glycan structures. These glycans play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions, immune evasion, and antifungal resistance. Understanding the intricacies of A. fumigatus glycomes is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat invasive aspergillosis. GlyGen provides a comprehensive resource for accessing and analyzing glycan-related data on A. fumigatus and other pathogens, facilitating research efforts to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying fungal pathogenicity.","As with other fungal pathogens, the surface glycans of A. fumigatus are critical for interactions with the host. The cell wall of infectious forms of this fungus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors. The hyphal wall has a core of branched β1-3-glucan covalently linked to other glucan components, chitin, and galactomannan, which consists of a mannose backbone with short galactofuranose side chains. Interestingly, galactomannan also occurs anchored to the plasma membrane by a GPI. This polysaccharide is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and is probably transferred to the cell wall by transglycosidases, in the same way as GPI-anchored proteins.",0.6666666666666666,0.6179607361031793,0.7997225696387913,0.05555555555555555,0.9999999999666667,1.0

 'A main technical challenge to understand GAG–protein interactions is to dissect the essential structural elements of GAGs that contribute to the binding. Unlike researchers studying DNA-binding proteins who have access to all possible DNA sequences, researchers studying GAG-binding proteins traditionally do not have access to GAG oligosaccharides with defined structures. Fortunately, this situation has begun to change in the last 5 years. With the rapid progress of chemoenzymatic and chemical synthesis (or a combination of both) of HS/CS oligosaccharides, a growing number of structural defined oligosaccharides (dp4-dp20) have become available. Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins.'
 'These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants. ConA-Sepharose is commonly used to isolate glycoproteins as it shows little binding to nonglycosylated proteins. However, it does not bind all glycoproteins because it recognizes specific N-glycan structures. ConA-Sepharose has also been used to isolate free oligo- and polymannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary N-glycans. When combined in a serial format, multiple lectins can be used in affinity chromatography to isolate glycoconjugates containing most of the major glycan structures present in animal cells, with glycoconjugates being separated as classes that share common determinants. An example of serial lectin affinity chromatography is shown in Figure 48.8. Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications.']","These methods typically involve covalently attaching the glycans to a solid support matrix, such as agarose beads or sepharose resins, through a spacer arm or linker molecule.

 'The sample was treated with sufficient ammonium sulfate to precipitate the complex but not the unbound ligand. The precipitated complex was captured on a filter and the amount of ligand in the complex was determined by γ-counting. In this approach, a glycoprotein (or ligand) is mixed with a GBP or antibody and the mixture is electrophoretically separated in polyacrylamide. For glycosaminoglycans, this technique is termed affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE). This method is particularly useful in defining the apparent Kd of the interaction and allows identification of subpopulations of glycosaminoglycans that differentially interact with the GBP. In another method, termed crossed affinity immunoelectrophoresis, a second step of electrophoresis is conducted in the second perpendicular dimension across an agarose gel that contains precipitating monospecific antibody to the glycoprotein or ligand.'
 'Thus, a multiplexed approach is taken where a GBP is mixed with a set of conjugated beads each identifiable by its fluorescent properties. The GBP may be biotinylated, allowing detection by fluorescent streptavidin, or the GBP may be detected by binding to specific antibody or another reagent if the GBP is epitope-tagged. The degree of binding of the GBP is a measure of its affinity and specificity for a particular glycan. The advantages of this approach is that it is high-throughput, allowing thousands of assays to be performed automatically, as well as utilizing small amounts of both glycan and GBP. The collection of data and its analysis are also automated. A limitation of the approach is that each glycan to be derivatized must be activated by having a primary amine or other chemistry for conjugation, and each conjugation of a glycan needs to be independently validated. Multivalent GBPs interacting with multivalent ligands, as expressed on cells, can cause the cells to agglutinate.']","The bound ligands can then be eluted from the bead-GBP complex for further analysis, such as identification and characterization.

Using this pull-down setup, one can perform a concentration-dependent binding assay to obtain an apparent Ka of the ligand for the immobilized GBP. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is one of the most rigorous means of defining the equilibrium binding constant between a glycan and a GBP or indeed any protein and its ligand. The binding of a glycan to the GBP is measured as a change in enthalpy using a commercial microcalorimeter. In this technique, a solution containing a glycan of interest is added in increments into a solution containing a fixed concentration of GBP. The glycan is added at many intervals and the heat evolved from binding is measured relative to a reference cell. Over the course of the experiment, the concentration of glycan is increased in the mixing cell over a glycan-to-GBP molar ratio of 0–10.

Two lectins, originally termed RCA-I and RCA-II, can be purified from the seeds. RCA-I (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) is a hemagglutinin and a very weak toxin. RCA-II (∼60 kDa), better known as ricin, is an agglutinin and a very potent toxin. Ricin is easily extractable from castor beans and can kill humans at very small doses.'
 'Ricin is easily extractable from castor beans and can kill humans at very small doses. RCA-II (ricin; Figure 31.2) is synthesized as a single prepropolypeptide of 576 amino acid (aa) residues containing a secretion signal peptide (residues 1–35), an A chain (residues 36–302), a 12-aa linker region (residues 303–314), and a B chain (residues 315–576). The A-chain toxin is an N-glycoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.22) that inactivates the 60S ribosome. The B-chain lectin domain binds to galactose (Gal) and β-galactosides. The amino-terminal signal sequence brings the propolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal is cleaved off, and the polypeptide is glycosylated.'
 'Through evolution, the R-type lectin domain has given rise to various protein forms, some containing this domain alone and others containing additional functional domains (e.g., enzyme or toxin). We will discuss the diversity of this superfamily in terms of molecular tinkering and “bricolage,” based on structure–function relationships. In 1888, Peter Hermann Stillmark at the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu, Estonia) reported that protein extracts from seeds of Ricinus communis (commonly called “castor oil plant”; seeds are called “castor beans”) contained a factor (which he termed “ricin”) capable of agglutinating erythrocytes. Ricin was already well known as a toxin, but its carbohydrate-binding specificity was not analyzed in detail until the mid-20th century, when it was classified as a lectin.']","These lectins are known for their ability to bind specifically to certain carbohydrate structures, making them valuable tools for studying glycan interactions. RCA-I and RCA-II from Ricinus communis have been extensively studied for their potential applications in glycobiology, including glycan profiling, cell surface labeling, and glycan purification. Additionally, these lectins have been investigated for their potential therapeutic uses, such as in targeted drug delivery and cancer therapy.","RCA-I (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) is a hemagglutinin and a very weak toxin.

"Complete the following paragraph: A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity.","['More than 100 of the seed legume L-type lectins have been characterized and are the most extensively studied proteins of this class. It also should be noted that the L-type fold has been observed in noncarbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectin-like receptor kinases in plants that are important in development and stress responses. A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet.'
 'The crystal structures of a number of legume seed lectins allowed the identification of the carbohydrate-binding sites. Structural similarities in the tertiary structures were identified among these lectins and several other lectins, including the galectins (see Chapter 36), as will be discussed in this chapter. For this reason, the term “L-type lectins” has recently been designated as a classification for all proteins with this legume seed lectin-like protein structure. The L-type lectins are distinguished from other lectins primarily based on tertiary structure and not the primary structure. In general, either the entire lectin monomer or the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of the more complex lectins is composed of antiparallel β-sheets connected by short loops and β-bends, and they usually lack any α-helices. These sheets form a dome-like structure related to the “jelly-roll fold,” which is often called a “lectin fold.” The carbohydrate-binding site is generally localized toward the apex of this dome.'
 'Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class.']","These lectins typically have a conserved metal-binding site that coordinates the Ca++ and Mn++ ions essential for their function. The metal ions play a crucial role in stabilizing the lectin structure and facilitating carbohydrate recognition through interactions with specific amino acid residues. Additionally, the presence of these metal ions is necessary for maintaining the lectin's optimal binding affinity and specificity towards carbohydrate ligands.","The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet. The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand.",0.4,0.5112358892702413,0.6189740192406139,0.11764705882352941,0.9999999999666667,0.16666666666666666

As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme.'
 'Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases. Late endosomes then undergo dynamic fusion/fission with lysosomes, allowing selective transfer of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes and leaving the MPRs behind in subdomains of the late endosomes. These MPRs may then either return to the TGN mediated by a multiprotein retromer complex or move to the plasma membrane, in which internalization via clathrin-coated pits occurs, mediated by the coat protein AP2. There are several pathways for the MPRs to be returned to the TGN from the various endosomal compartments, although the relative importance of the different pathways is unclear. Subcellular trafficking pathways of glycoproteins, lysosomal enzymes, and M6P receptors (MPRs). Newly synthesized glycoproteins originating from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pass through the Golgi stacks and are then sorted to various destinations.'
 'MPRs avoid delivery to lysosomes, in which they would be degraded. This trafficking is governed by a number of short amino acid sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. The TGN is the site in which newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes bind to MPRs that are then collected into clathrin-coated pits and packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to the early endosome. This process involves interaction of the MPRs with two types of coat proteins: the GGAs (Golgi-localized, γ-ear–containing, ADP-ribosylation factor binding) and AP1 (adapter protein 1). In addition to binding MPRs, the coat proteins recruit clathrin for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles. Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases.']","This process, known as receptor-mediated endocytosis, allows for the recycling of lysosomal enzymes and ensures their proper localization within the cell. The binding of lysosomal enzymes to cell-surface CI-MPRs facilitates their internalization and transport back to the late endosomal compartments, where they can be sorted for delivery to lysosomes. This mechanism plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of lysosomal enzymes within the cell and is essential for proper lysosomal function.","This secretion–recapture pathway is a minor one in most cells, but plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy. As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme. Some of these enzymes that are targeted to lysosomes via the M6P pathway have been prepared in large quantities as recombinant soluble proteins and used in enzyme replacement therapy. To date, the benefits have been variable but less than optimal. There are a number of potential reasons for this. First, some of the preparations may not contain the physiologic complement of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker. It is reasonable to suggest that a greater M6P content may improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement in these patients. This has been shown to be the case in mouse and dog model systems. However, even with fully phosphorylated enzymes there may be obstacles that are difficult to overcome. For example, some cell types in the body may not express adequate levels of the CI-MPR on their surfaces to endocytose sufficient enzyme to restore normal lysosomal function. Also, the organ that is most seriously affected in many of these diseases (the brain) is inaccessible because of the blood–brain barrier. Although the first intraventricular M6P-dependent enzyme replacement therapy for children deficient for the lysosomal tripeptidyl peptidase 1 are very promising, further studies are needed.",0.0,0.6311361137409196,0.6158504271454538,0.1111111111111111,0.9999999999666667,0.4

GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GAG hyaluronic acid (hyaladherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that facilitates recognition of short segments of the invariant hyaluronan repeating disaccharide (Chapter 16), so they are best classified as lectins rather than grouped with sulfated GAG-binding proteins. The rest of this chapter emphasizes lectins, different families of which are detailed in Chapters 31–37. Sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also discussed, and are detailed further in Chapter 38.'
 'The chapters that follow describe the analysis of glycan–protein interactions (Chapter 29), the physical principles involved (Chapter 30), and the structures and biological functions of important subclasses of GBPs (Chapters 31–38). GBPs (which exclude glycan-specific antibodies) are found in all living organisms and fall into two overarching groups—lectins and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (compared in Online Appendix 28A). Lectins are further classified into evolutionarily related families identified by carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) based on primary and/or three-dimensional structural similarities (Figure 28.1). CRDs can exist as stand-alone proteins or as domains within larger multidomain proteins. They typically recognize terminal groups on glycans, which fit into shallow but well-defined binding pockets (Chapters 29 and 30).']","In contrast to lectins, which tend to fall into evolutionarily conserved families (Chapters 28–37), GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds and instead appear to have evolved by convergent evolution. Several hundred GAG-binding proteins have been discovered, which make up the GAG-interactome and fall into the broad classes presented in Table 38.1. These proteins exhibit diverse structural motifs and binding specificities, reflecting the complexity and versatility of glycosaminoglycan interactions in various biological processes.","To a large extent, studies of the GAG-interactome have focused on protein interactions with heparin, a more highly sulfated, iduronic acid (IdoA)-rich form of heparan sulfate (HS; Chapter 17). This bias reflects, in part, the commercial availability of heparin and heparin-Sepharose, which are frequently used for fractionation studies, and the partially incorrect assumption that binding to heparin mimics binding to HS present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. There are also a large number of proteins known to interact with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) with comparable avidity and affinity; there are fewer examples of specific interactions with keratan sulfate (KS), but this may reflect fewer studies of KS. In some cases, CS may be the physiologically relevant ligand because CS predominates in many tissues. Determining the physiological relevance of these interactions is a major area of research.",0.6666666666666666,0.7773799457973937,0.6554509238363159,0.06666666666666667,0.99999999995,0.2

The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages. First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. A cytoplasmic α-mannosidase cleaves up to four Man residues to generate Man5GlcNAc (Man c, d, e, f, and g in Figure 39.1). This glycan is then taken into the lysosome via an ATP-dependent lysosomal membrane transporter for final degradation to monosaccharides. Whether these free glycans have any function in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment before they are degraded has not been investigated.'
 'Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the pore by which ERAD-L substrates are actually transported to the cytosol has not been identified, it is known that the substrates must be unfolded in the ER lumen. Although studies on ERAD complexes have been mainly performed in S. cerevisiae, mammalian cells have homologs of nearly all proteins described in the yeast complexes. N-Glycans are removed from unfolded glycoproteins during proteasomal degradation. A cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, N-glycanase, NGLY1) plays an important role in both removing the glycan and constructing an efficient predegradation complex (Figure 39.3). NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins.'
 'A sizable fraction of nascent proteins fail quality control of folding and assembly in the rER (Chapter 39) and are retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm as a part of ERAD (ER-associated degradation), as depicted in Figure 18.1H. Most of these are N-glycosylated and normally processed by a cytoplasmic N-glycanase (NGLY1) or an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase) to remove their N-glycans before their degradation by the 26S-proteasome or an autophagic vacuole. There are also N-glycan-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligases that assemble polyubiquitin chains that serve as a signal for proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, NGLY1 is essential for mitochondrial turnover via mitophagy, although evidence suggests it functions via a role other than deglycosylating mitochondrial proteins.']","First, the N-glycan is trimmed by cytoplasmic enzymes to remove the outermost glucose residues. Then, the remaining glycan is processed by cytoplasmic exoglycosidases to release individual monosaccharides. This stepwise degradation of the N-glycan allows for efficient recycling of the monosaccharides and ensures proper turnover of glycoproteins in the cell.","First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.

Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an ER-associated negative regulator of innate immunity. Mutations that affect TREX1 function are associated with numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Chapter 45). The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation. The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies.'
 'Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter. It is not known if these free glycans have any signaling functions in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment. In the lysosome, glycosidases hydrolyze the glycans into monomeric sugars that can then be reused by the cell.'
 'For instance, the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, CFTR-ΔF508, leads to improper folding of this chloride channel and its retention in the ER. Importantly, the mutation affects CFTR transit to the plasma membrane but not its transport activity. Similarly, UGGT recognition of a brassinosteroid receptor mutant triggers retention in the ER of Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Thus, certain diseases caused by ER retention of defective glycoproteins might be ameliorated by inhibitors of UGGT activity. One beautiful example of how the fine sensitivity of UGGT allows modulation of basic physiological processes is its role during antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I). Here, MHC I complexes loaded with suboptimal peptides are recognized by UGGT, thus triggering their retention in the ER. On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface.']","The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation.

The presence of certain glycans on sperm surfaces facilitates their binding to mucins in the female reproductive tract, aiding in sperm transport and capacitation. Additionally, interactions between glycans on sperm and ova within the fallopian tubes are necessary for successful fertilization to occur. Furthermore, during implantation, glycans on the embryo and the uterine lining are involved in adhesion processes that are critical for the establishment of pregnancy. Glycosylation-deficient male mice may exhibit impaired fertility due to disruptions in these glycan-mediated recognition events.

CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis.

 'However, the epitopes involved do not seem to be glycan-related. Another likely possibility is that the altered glycosylation changes interactions with Fc receptors. Glycans and their binding proteins are key to the pathogenicity of essentially all infectious diseases, and this topic is covered in greater detail in Chapters 37, 42, and 43. Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here. Many urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, which adhere to bladder epithelial cells via a mannose-binding lectin, FimH, located on the F-pilus of the bacterium. A simple and effective antibiotic-independent treatment and prevention for this very common infection is drinking D-mannose because it competes bacterial glycan binding to the urinary tract when it is excreted in the urine. Another alternative is optimized synthetic α-mannosides, which could treat and prevent UTIs.'
 'This can be accomplished by several distinct mechanisms and often confers properties of immune evasive and enhanced virulence. For example, the human-specific pathogen N. gonorrhoeae uses a surface sialyltransferase and scavenges the activated form of sialic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) from the host. Such incorporation thwarts multiple arms of the host complement system and confers resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPS). An Achilles’ heel of this increasingly drug-resistant pathogen may be the promiscuity of its sialyltransferase toward related nonulosonic acids. Unnatural incorporation of legionaminic acid (CMP-Leg5,7Ac2) in N. gonorrhoeae prevents the immune evasion benefits typically afforded by Neu5Ac; moreover, vaginal administration of CMP-Leg5,7Ac2 leads to more rapid bacterial clearance of genital infections in mice.']","Additionally, optimized synthetic α-mannosides offer a promising approach for targeting specific pathogens involved in urinary tract infections (UTIs). By mimicking the natural α-mannosides found on host cell surfaces, these synthetic compounds can competitively inhibit pathogen binding and potentially prevent infection. The variability in glycan expression among individuals may contribute to differences in susceptibility to UTIs, highlighting the importance of understanding and targeting these interactions for therapeutic interventions.","For example, some pathogenic strains of E. coli infect the urinary tract using a lectin that binds the P blood group antigens (Chapter 14), with P negative individuals being immune.

 'Subsequently, genetic screens were performed using HAP1 (haploid) human cells mutagenized by retroviral gene trap.

An adaptation of this technique allows detection of mutants affecting a specific enzyme by direct assay for activity in colony lysates generated on a disc. Although this technique has great specificity, its limited capacity makes detection of rare mutants difficult, and mutagenesis before screening is usually a requirement. The resulting strains must be cloned and carefully characterized for stability and the biochemical and molecular basis of mutation. Additional genetic analyses include somatic cell hybridization for dominance/recessive testing and assigning mutants to different genetic complementation groups.

Importantly, many mutants resistant to one or more lectins because of the loss of specific sugars become supersensitive to a different group of lectins that recognize sugar residues exposed by the mutation (Figure 49.2). The latter may be used to select for revertants in the original mutant population. Nontoxic lectins are also useful for enriching lectin-binding mutants (e.g., by flow cytometry).

Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage.

However, linkage analysis provides no information on the nature of substituents or sequence information and cannot reveal α- or β-anomeric configuration. (See following page.)

 'A wealth of information exists on the chemical generation of glycans and various protecting group manipulations used in the context of glycan synthesis. A glycosidic linkage is generally formed through the activation of a glycosylating agent (glycosyl donor) to create an electrophilic species that reacts with the nucleophile, for example, a hydroxyl group present on the glycosyl acceptor. Other possible acceptors include serine/threonine in the case of glycopeptides or a sphingoid in the case of glycosphingolipids. The glycosylation reaction results in the formation of either an α- or β-glycosidic linkage (see Chapter 2). A major challenge in glycan synthesis is the stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds (Figure 53.1A; Chapter 2). A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages.']","Linkage analysis involves breaking the glycosidic bonds between monosaccharide units in a glycan molecule and analyzing the resulting fragments to determine the connectivity and sequence of sugars. By introducing stable substituents like ether-linked methyl groups onto the free hydroxyl groups of the native glycan, researchers can selectively modify specific linkages and create characteristic fragmentation patterns that can be analyzed to deduce the original glycan structure. This method is crucial for elucidating the complex and diverse structures of glycans in biological systems.","Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol).

To make this information relevant, the scientist often requires explicit information about the biological context (e.g., tissue and disease state) corresponding to the specified glycosylation or describing how the glycosylation changes when the tissue or cell is perturbed. The glycoscience community is building on the efforts of the Human Proteome Organization-Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to develop similar resources that describe the information that should be included when reporting experimental data, with digital data exchange formats to facilitate communication of structural and biological information and controlled vocabularies that allow the data that is exchanged to be unambiguously interpreted.'

For example, a researcher often refers to various publications to derive a new hypothesis to test. Using the Semantic Web, the data in the publications would be formatted in such a way (using predefined vocabulary, or ontologies) that the meaning behind the data is preserved in a computable form, on the Web.

 'Because of their stereochemistry and water solubility, organic synthesis of glycans has proven to be one of the most challenging areas of synthetic organic chemistry (Chapter 53). The combined use of purified glycosyltransferases with chemically synthesized glycan precursors has proven to be invaluable in the stereoselective synthesis of complex glycans (Chapter 54). Automated synthesis of glycans is rapidly becoming a reality, and even the synthesis of the most complex glycans, such as glycosaminoglycans, is becoming possible. In the past five years, major advances have been reported in both the automated chemical and the automated chemico-enzymatic synthesis of complex glycans. In the future, it seems likely that the synthesis of glycans will become nearly as facile and widely available as the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. It should be possible for biologists to easily obtain glycoconjugates that have homogeneously uniform glycans to further explore the structural and functional roles of the glycans.']","Pure glycans of defined structure are crucial for advancing research in glycobiology.

 'In addition, simple, rapidly turning over, protein-bound glycans are abundant within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in which they can serve as regulatory switches. A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids). In analogy to the current situation in Cosmology, glycans can be considered as the “dark matter” of the biological universe: a major and critical component that has yet to be fully incorporated into the “standard model” of biology. However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities.'
 'Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states. Significant progress has also been made in Systems Glycobiology by better integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Our understanding as to how miRNAs and transcription factors regulate glycan expression has also improved in the last few years (Chapters 51 and 52). At the present time, the study of glycan structure/function relationships requires highly specialized expertise in synthetic and analytical chemistry. The inherent difficulty in studying glycans remains a major challenge preventing glycobiology—the study of glycan function—from entering mainstream conceptual frameworks of biology. In response to this challenge, strong emphasis has recently been placed on the development of facile technologies that will allow nonglycobiologists without specialized analytical chemistry skills to study glycans in a meaningful way.']","A strong basic knowledge base regarding the genomics, chemistry, biochemistry, biosynthesis, and biological roles of these ubiquitous and diverse molecules is now well-established (Chapters 2–19).

Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies.",0.75,0.6597355633992346,0.7869234481942556,0.1875,0.9999999999666667,0.1
How were CD33 Siglecs identified?,"['CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia. It has two Ig domains and was the first of the CD33rSiglecs to be characterized as an inhibitory receptor, suppressing activation of FcγRI and recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Figure 35.5). CD33 has some preference for α2-6- rather than α2-3-sialylated glycans and binds strongly to sialylated ligands on myeloid leukemia cell lines. The restricted expression of CD33 has been exploited in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia using gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody coupled to the toxic antibiotic calicheamicin. Binding of anti-CD33 mAbs to CD33 triggers endocytosis of the bound antibody.'
 ""Binding of anti-CD33 mAbs to CD33 triggers endocytosis of the bound antibody. This depends on ITIM phosphorylation, recruitment of the E3 ligase Cbl, and ubiquitylation of the CD33 cytoplasmic tail. Selective expression of CD33 on leukemic progenitor cells also makes it an attractive target for therapy using chimeric antigen receptors expressed on cytotoxic T cells. Proposed biological functions mediated by CD33-related Siglecs. A generic CD33-related Siglec is represented, showing the location of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the potential for inhibitory signaling.  Recently, two coinherited single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with protection of humans against late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These SNPs result in increased exon 2 skipping, leading to raised levels of CD33 lacking the V-set domain and reduced levels of full-length CD33.""
 'Overall, it appears that this class of SIGLEC genes is subject to multiple “Red Queen” effects in evolution, in which evolutionary changes of sialyltransferases in response to the emergence of Sia-binding pathogens may lead to subsequent evolutionary changes of Siglec specificities (Figure 35.4). Probable evolutionary chain of Red Queen effects involving Sias and CD33rSiglecs. See text for discussion. (Redrawn, with permission, from Padler-Karavani V, et al. 2014. FASEB J 28: 1280–1293.)

CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia.']","CD33 Siglecs were identified through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental studies. The Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin) family of proteins, including CD33, were initially identified based on sequence homology and structural similarities in their extracellular domains.

Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze genomic and protein sequence data to identify genes encoding proteins with similar structural features to known Siglecs. Experimental studies, such as gene expression analysis, protein purification, and functional assays, were then conducted to confirm the sialic acid-binding activity and characterize the biological functions of these proteins.

Overall, the identification of CD33 Siglecs involved a combination of computational analysis and experimental validation to elucidate their roles in immune regulation and cell-cell interactions.","Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans. The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins. However, it became clear that these four Sia-binding molecules were a distinct subgroup sharing both sequence homology and Ig-domain organization, and that they were not all involved in adhesion. The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.",0.16666666666666666,0.9999994210220632,0.717262968320576,0.05555555555555555,0.9999999999666667,0.0
What degree of polymerization is necessary for oligosaccharins to trigger plant defense?,"['Oligosaccharins that are active in plants.

 'A single active hepta-glucoside from oomycete walls was isolated from a mixture of approximately 300 inactive structural isomers and found to trigger defense responses in soybean. Both the DP and location of the β-1-3 branches in this oligosaccharide are important for its biological activity (Figure 40.2). Elongating the oligosaccharide at the reducing end had no discernible effect on bioactivity and activity was also largely retained by removal of a single glucose from the reducing end. However, the hexa-glucoside was the minimal structure of this oligosaccharide that had appreciable activity in inducing defense responses in soybean. The low quantities and different types of glycan signal molecules that elicit defense responses suggest that these glycans are recognized by specific plasma membrane-localized receptors. A 75-kDa plasma membrane protein with high-binding affinity for chitin elicitors was identified in rice cell plasma membranes and proposed to be involved in oligosaccharide perception and signal transduction.'
 'Other pathogen-derived oligosaccharins are the PAMPs derived from linear homo-oligomers from fungal/oomycete cell walls that include chitin [1,4-β-D-(GlcNAc)n], and its deacetylated form (chitosan), and β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2). More recently, additional plant cell wall–derived oligosaccharins have been shown to trigger defense responses, including cellulose-derived oligomers (β-1,4-glucans), mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs: β-1,4/β-1,3 glucans), and oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucans, mannans, xylans, or callose, which trigger signaling cascades in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including crops (Figure 40.2).']","Oligosaccharins typically need to have a degree of polymerization (DP) of around 10-20 to trigger plant defense responses.

What do glycosyltransferases do?,"['The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide.'
 'The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10).'
 'Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11).

The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways.']","Glycosyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, resulting in the formation of glycosidic bonds.

What do glycosidases do?,"['Exoglycosidases cleave the glycosidic linkage of terminal sugars from the nonreducing end of glycans (the outermost left end of glycans for figures in this book, e.g., Figure 44.1). Exoglycosidases recognize only one monosaccharide (rarely two) in a specific anomeric linkage and are much less particular about the structure of the molecule beyond that glycosidic linkage. This lack of specificity allows these enzymes to act on a broad range of substrates. However, exoglycosidases do not usually work unless all of the hydroxyl groups of the terminal sugar are unmodified. Acetate, sulfate, or phosphate groups usually have to be removed before action of the glycosidases. Esterases cleave acetyl groups and specific sulfatases remove the sulfate groups on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N- or O-linked glycans.'
 'Unlike the glycosyltransferases, members of this family have evolved independently many times, a fact reflected in the diverse array of three-dimensional structures observed for these enzymes. Glycosidases play important roles in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars and for the turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes. Glycosidases are also involved in the formation of intermediates that are used as substrates for glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of glycans. The use of glycosidases in this way is particularly important in the biosynthesis of N-glycan-containing glycoproteins in more evolutionarily advanced eukaryotes and is thought to be associated with the acquisition of complex N-glycans during the evolution of multicellular organisms.'
 'In contrast to glycosyltransferase-mediated reactions, in which the equilibrium is shifted predominantly to (natural) product formation because of the intrinsic reactivity of donor glycosides, the equilibrium in a glycosidase-mediated reaction can be influenced such that the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction. Under physiological conditions, with high water concentrations, glycosidases hydrolyze glycosidic linkages to produce the corresponding hemiacetal, either with retention (Figure 54.5A) or inversion of configuration at the anomeric center. Performing a glycosidase reaction in partly nonaqueous conditions, by addition of large excess of aglycon, by inducing kinetic conditions or by a combination of these allows for partial reversal of the reaction equilibrium. By this means and in a “transglycosylation” event, glycans can be constructed.']","Glycosidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in complex carbohydrates, such as glycoproteins, glycolipids, and polysaccharides.

What donor substrates do glycosyltranferases transfer monosaccharides from?,"['In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22).'
 'This is usually sufficient to reach or exceed the calculated Km of glycosyltransferases that use these donors.

They are organelle-specific and their location usually corresponds to the location of the relevant glycosyltransferases (Table 5.2; Figure 5.4).

However, the import is competitively inhibited by the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and diphosphates in the cytosol but not by the monosaccharides.'
 'Iduronic acid does not have a nucleotide sugar parent because it is formed by epimerization of glucuronic acid after it is incorporated into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In some instances, one nucleotide sugar can be formed from another either by direct epimerization (reaction 2 above) or by a nucleotide exchange reaction (reaction 3 above).

 'Monosaccharide precursors are imported into the cell, salvaged from degraded glycans, or created enzymatically from other sugars within the cell. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation occurs mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, whereas monosaccharide activation and interconversions occur mostly in the cytoplasm.

In some cases, nucleotide sugars are used to synthesize activated lipid-linked intermediates before glycan transfer. This chapter describes how cells accomplish these tasks, with an emphasis on animal cells. Glucose and fructose are the major carbon and energy sources for organisms as diverse as yeast and humans.

Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another.

 'The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]).

The process of glycan elongation by glycosyltransferases involves several steps:

1. Recognition of acceptor substrate: Glycosyltransferases recognize specific acceptor molecules, such as glycoproteins or glycolipids, based on their structure and composition.

2. Binding of donor substrate: The enzyme binds to an activated sugar donor molecule, such as a nucleotide sugar (e.g., UDP-glucose, GDP-fucose), which serves as the source of the sugar moiety to be transferred.

3. Transfer of sugar moiety: The glycosyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the sugar moiety from the donor substrate to the acceptor substrate, forming a glycosidic bond between the two molecules.

One is the direct reaction of N-acetylgalactosamine-1-P with UTP.'
 'In this case, removal of the N-acetylglucosamine moiety by the glycosidase, O-GlcNAcase, provides a means of dynamically regulating the extent of O-GlcNAcylation and the diverse processes that it mediates. Glycosyltransferases catalyze their reactions with either inversion or retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon atom of the donor substrate (Figure 6.5). For example, β1-4 galactosyltransferase, an inverting glycosyltransferase, transfers galactose from UDP-α-Gal to generate a β1-4-linked galactose-containing product. Inversion of stereochemistry follows from the fact that the enzyme uses an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction mechanism in which an acceptor hydroxyl group attacks the anomeric carbon atom of UDP-Gal from one side and UDP leaves from the other (Figure 6.5A).'

The UDP-GlcNAc transporters from mammalian cells and yeast are 22% identical, whereas mammalian CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GlcNAc transporters have 40%–50% identity.

All GALNTs are classified in the GT27 CaZy family with a GT-A fold (Chapter 8), and most have a lectin (ricin-like) domain at the carboxyl terminus, which is unique among glycosyltransferases. GALNTs coordinate the transfer of GalNAc from the donor substrate (UDP-GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr on acceptor substrates and fall into two general categories: those that require the presence of an extant GalNAc on a peptide or protein before they will add additional GalNAcs (glycopeptide-preferring transferases), and those that will transfer GalNAc to a modified or unmodified protein (peptide transferases).'
 'Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis.

This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase.']","Some examples of human galactosyltransferases include:

1. B4GALT1 (Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1)

What factors contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species?,"['In contrast, bacterial sialyltransferases bear little resemblance to those of eukaryotes, and the vast sequence differences between different bacterial sialyltransferases indicate that these have even been reinvented on several separate occasions. Of course, lateral gene transfer is common among Bacteria and Archaea, facilitating rapid phylogenetic dissemination of such enzymatic “inventions.” Why do closely related species differ with regard to the presence or absence of certain glycans? Does the same glycoprotein have the same type of glycosylation in distinct but related species? Relatively little data exist regarding these issues, but examples of both, extreme conservation and diversification are found. A reasonable explanation is that conservation of glycan structure reflects specific functional constraints for the glycans in question. In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral).'
 'If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species.'
 'This variation is also associated with spontaneously appearing and persistently circulating antibodies against the missing glycan determinant, thus forming a kind of “interspecies blood group.” This glycan difference may also be protective for the primate lineage which lost the “αGal” structure and has a high-titer circulating antibody, as it is now better protected against infection by enveloped viruses emanating from other mammals. Independent losses of the vertebrate-specific sialic acid Neu5Gc in humans and some other mammalian clades is a further example of glycan evolution by loss of function (Chapter 15). In the process, these lineages have lost a potent signal of self, resulting in protection from microbes that synthesize this glycan. Regardless of the mechanisms maintaining these types of polymorphisms, such intra- and interspecies diversity might also provide for “herd immunity,” a phenomenon whereby one glycan variant–resistant individual can indirectly protect other susceptible individuals by restricting the spread of a pathogen through the population.']","There are several factors that contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species:

1. **Conserved biological functions**: Glycans play essential roles in various biological processes such as cell-cell recognition, signaling, immune response, and host-pathogen interactions. These functions are often conserved across different species, leading to the persistence of certain glycan structures.

2. **Selective pressure**: Evolutionary pressures, such as interactions with pathogens, predators, or environmental challenges, can drive the conservation of specific glycan structures that provide a survival advantage to the organism.

3. **Co-evolution with interacting partners**: Glycans often interact with proteins, other glycans, or cells in complex biological networks. Co-evolution of these interacting partners can lead to the conservation of specific glycan structures to maintain functional interactions.

4. **Genetic constraints**: The biosynthesis and regulation of glycan structures are controlled by a complex network of enzymes and genes. Genetic constraints can limit the variability of glycan structures within a species or related species, leading to evolutionary persistence.

5. **Horizontal gene transfer**: In some cases, horizontal gene transfer events can introduce glycan biosynthetic pathways from one species to another, leading to the conservation of specific glycan structures across distantly related species.

6. **Ecological niche adaptation**: Glycan structures can also be shaped by the ecological niche of an organism. Species occupying similar ecological niches may evolve similar glycan structures to interact with their environment in a similar way.

By considering these factors, scientists can better understand the evolutionary persistence of glycan structures and functions across distinct but related species.","There is too little information available today to allow a comprehensive exposition of the evolution of even the major classes of glycans. However, based on available data, it is reasonable to suggest that selective pressures largely come from either intrinsic or extrinsic factors related to organism-specific functions of glycans and competitive host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Host glycans must evolve rapidly to compete with pathogens that have short generation times, high mutation rates, and horizontal gene transfer, yet glycans with a critical intrinsic role may incur deleterious effects if eliminated or mutated.",0.9090909090909091,0.9999999999999996,0.7031278435047519,0.10526315789473684,0.9999999999666667,1.0
What is the significance of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains?,"['R-type lectins have a fold termed “β-trefoil fold” (from the Latin “trifolium” meaning “three-leaved,” as seen for example in clover) (Figure 31.4). The β-trefoil fold presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding the 40-residue subdomain. The three subdomains, termed α, β, and γ, each consist of 12 β-strands and loops arranged around a central axis, giving the protein internal pseudorotation symmetry. β-trefoil fold is maintained by the characteristic Q-x-W motif in each subdomain of ricin B-chain and common R-type lectins. More than 10% of lectins use this fold for glycan recognition (Chapter 30). Structures of β-trefoil folds of R-type lectin domains in various proteins.'

In view of the conserved structures consisting of variable loops and a short β-barrel, in combination with low sequence homology based on β-strands connected by loops, the ability of β-trefoil proteins to flexibly select a variety of carbohydrate partners is not surprising.'
 'In each subunit, the α- and β-subdomain functioned, respectively, to capture carbohydrates and subunits connected by a disulfide bond. Prototype and tandem-repeat R-type lectins consisting solely of β-trefoil domains have been identified in various invertebrate groups, including sponges (phylum Porifera), earthworms (Annelida) (EW29: PDB 2ZQN), bivalves (Mollusca) (UniProt A0A646QVV9), and brachiopods (Brachiopoda) (UniProt A0A646QV64).']","The beta-trefoil fold is a common structural motif found in many carbohydrate-binding proteins, including R-type lectin domains. R-type lectins are a type of carbohydrate-binding protein that specifically recognize and bind to complex carbohydrates. The beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains plays a crucial role in facilitating carbohydrate recognition and binding.

The beta-trefoil fold consists of three similar motifs arranged in a three-fold symmetric manner, forming a compact and stable structure. This structural motif provides a scaffold for the binding site of the R-type lectin domain, allowing it to interact with specific carbohydrate ligands with high affinity and specificity.

The presence of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains allows them to participate in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell interactions, immune responses, and pathogen recognition. Understanding the significance of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains is essential for elucidating their molecular mechanisms and designing targeted therapies that modulate carbohydrate-protein interactions.","Beta-trefoil folds are a hallmark structural feature of R-type lectins that enable specificity in carbohydrate binding. These folds are observed in several protein families, including interleukin-1 and fibroblast growth factor, as key components in antigen-recognition and hormonal signalling cascades. Although beta-trefoil folds are a common subunit of R-type lectins, usually there are one or two subdomains responsible for recognizing and binding a carbohydrate ligand.",0.07142857142857142,0.937979464804242,0.8846153743496058,0.4166666666666667,0.9999999999666667,0.3333333333333333
What is a common mechanism by which plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells?,"['The latter three lectins are heterodimeric, disulfide-bonded proteins that are classified as type-II ribosome-inactivating proteins; they contain an A subunit that constitutes an enzyme called RNA-N-glycosidase, which inactivates the 28S ribosome, and a B subunit that is a galactose-binding lectin (Chapter 31). Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture. One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors.'
 'One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained. More details about glycosylation mutants of cultured cells are presented in Chapter 49. The specificity of lectins and antibodies to particular glycans has made them especially useful in cloning genes encoding glycosyltransferases or other proteins required for proper glycosylation, such as nucleotide sugar transporters. For example, CHO cells and the African green monkey kidney cell line COS lack glycans with terminal α-galactose residues.'
 'There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development. L-type lectins are involved in the symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as in Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, but the precise function of lectins in this regard is unclear. A recent study has shown that the D. biflorus seed lectin is also a lipoxygenase. It will be of interest to see how many other L-type lectins have this activity, which is necessary to initiate the wound-induced defense pathway in plants.']","Plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells through their ability to bind to specific carbohydrate structures on the surface of animal cells. Once bound, plant lectins can interfere with cell signaling pathways, disrupt cell adhesion, and induce cell death. This can lead to a variety of toxic effects, including inflammation, gastrointestinal disturbances, and organ damage.","Many plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas other lectins, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not toxic to animal cells in culture.

How do conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates?,"['Early studies suggested species specificity in the occurrence of specific Sia variants. With analytical improvements, it became evident that Sia variations are more widely expressed across species but occur at differing levels. Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage (Chapter 27), which comprises vertebrates and some “higher” invertebrates (such as echinoderms). Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates. This may change as molecular techniques improve. For example, insects were believed to be free of Sias until their discovery in cicada Malpighian tubules and Drosophila brains, and later identification of a single Drosophila gene (SiaT) with sequence similarities to mammalian STs. When SiaT is inactivated, flies suffer locomotor abnormalities and defects in neuromuscular junctions. Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila.'
 'Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila. Sias have also been reported in the nervous systems of behaviorally complex protostomes like octopus and squid. On the other hand, no Sias or ST genes were found in the well-studied round worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25). It appears that Sias (other than Kdn, which probably appeared earlier) were “invented” in a common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes and then became essential in deuterostomes, while being partially or completely discarded in some protostome lineages. Interestingly, there is wide variation in Sia expression and complexity within deuterostomes, with the sialome of echinoderms appearing very complex and that of humans being among the simplest.'
 'They appear in bacteria from diverse taxa with varied lifestyles in the environment or with animals, including “lower” animals often in internally linked positions that do not mimic known structures in “higher” animals. Sias became prominent in animals when the Deuterostome lineage emerged at the Cambrian Explosion ∼530 million years ago. Sequence homology suggests that ancient prokaryotic NulO biosynthetic pathways later became an evolutionary template that allowed some microbes to reinvent Sias of “higher” animals by convergent evolution. Many important commensals and pathogens use Sia mimicry to evade the vertebrate immune system by one or more of several established mechanisms. Some of the prokaryotic NulOs that share the same stereochemistry as Sias can engage in mechanisms of Sia mimicry, at times conveying pathogenic properties in unintended hosts following environmental exposure or zoonosis. Some examples of bacterial NulO-containing structures are provided (Figure 15.5).']","Conservation patterns for Sia (sialic acid) variants can vary across different species, including vertebrates and higher invertebrates. Sialic acids are a family of nine-carbon sugars that are commonly found at the outermost ends of glycan chains on cell surfaces. They play important roles in various biological processes, including cell-cell interactions, immune responses, and pathogen recognition.

In terms of conservation patterns, sialic acid variants can differ in terms of the specific types of sialic acids present, the linkages between sialic acids and other sugars in glycan chains, and the distribution of sialic acids on different cell types and tissues.

For example, some sialic acid variants may be more conserved across vertebrates, indicating that they play important functional roles that have been maintained throughout evolution. On the other hand, certain sialic acid variants may show more variability across higher invertebrates, reflecting differences in glycan structures and functions in these organisms.

To explore and compare conservation patterns for Sia variants across different species, researchers can utilize bioinformatics tools and databases such as GlyGen, which provide comprehensive information on glycan structures, enzymes involved in glycan biosynthesis, and glycan-related pathways in various organisms. By analyzing glycan data from different species, researchers can gain insights into the evolutionary conservation and diversity of sialic acid variants and their biological significance in different organisms.","Ancestral sialyltransferase families in invertebrates have been identified through sequence-based analysis showing orthology with the last common vertebrate ancestor. Increased diversity within vertebrate lineages is inferred to have resulted from divergent evolution, with a variety of gain-of-function and loss-of-function events identified in sialyltransferases throughout their evolutionary history.",0.47058823529411764,0.8595872827114303,0.6077593067474776,0.05263157894736842,0.9999999999666667,0.5
What's the relationship between Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes and plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis?,"['Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles. This is in contrast to cellulose, which is synthesized at the plasma membrane where the glucan chains are extruded into the apoplast to form cellulose microfibrils. Lignin is polymerized in the apoplast by nonenzymatic radical reactions. Despite advances in identifying and understanding the GTs involved in polysaccharide synthesis, we still do not know how many of the wall polymers are synthesized by Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes or if they are assembled by GTs localized in different regions of the Golgi apparatus. We also do not understand how the newly synthesized polymers are assembled into a functional cell wall in the apoplast. Plants produce glycoproteins and proteoglycans that contain oligo- or polysaccharides that are linked to hydroxyproline (Hyp) and serine (Ser).'
 'This sequence is required for normal xylan synthesis during secondary cell-wall formation and may have a role in regulating the polymers chain length. This sequence is present at the reducing end of heteroxylans of all monocots except the grasses. Genes that encode polysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes, including many of those required for xyloglucan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose synthesis and some of those required for pectin synthesis, have been identified. This information, together with improved methods to demonstrate enzymatic activity of recombinant plant GTs in vitro and wall structural analyses of the corresponding plant mutants is providing a framework for an increased understanding of how plant cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized. Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles.'
 'In contrast, homogalacturonan is continually modified by the action of wall enzymes and its contribution to wall architecture is therefore time dependent. Increased knowledge of the physical properties of primary wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans is required to understand how modulating the amounts and structural features of a few common polysaccharides and glycan domains lead to primary walls with diverse properties and functionalities. Further research is also needed to determine if wall structure and function results from the noncovalent interactions of polysaccharides and proteoglycans or from the formation of glycan-containing architectural units with specific structural and functional roles. The latter scenario is analogous to the organization of proteoglycans and O-linked mucins in the extracellular matrix of animal cells (Chapters 10, 16, and 17). The secondary walls of woody tissue and grasses are composed predominantly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and the polyphenol lignin.']","Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes play a crucial role in plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis. These complexes are responsible for the sequential assembly of polysaccharides, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, which are major components of the plant cell wall. The enzymes within these complexes work together to synthesize and modify the polysaccharides before they are secreted to the cell wall.

The Golgi apparatus serves as a central hub for the synthesis, processing, and trafficking of these polysaccharides within the plant cell. The Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes ensure the coordinated and efficient synthesis of complex polysaccharides by bringing together the necessary enzymes in close proximity. This spatial organization allows for the rapid and precise assembly of polysaccharides, leading to the formation of a structurally and functionally diverse plant cell wall.

Overall, Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes are essential for the biosynthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides and play a critical role in determining the composition and properties of the cell wall, which in turn influences various aspects of plant growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli.","The plant Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in cell wall biosynthesis, as it is the location for production of cell wall matrix polysaccharides, modification of protein glycosylation, and assembly/trafficking of cellulos synthase complexes.",0.0,0.9557387108006233,0.8201246844407937,0.0625,0.99999999995,1.0

(For simplicity, disorders affecting multiple pathways are included in disorders (more...) Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans  The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation. The first were identified in the early 1980s based primarily on deficiencies in multiple plasma glycoproteins. The patients were also delayed in reaching growth and developmental milestones and had low muscle tone, incomplete brain development, visual problems, coagulation defects, and endocrine abnormalities. However, many of these symptoms are also seen in patients with other multisystemic genetic syndromes.'
 'Among genetic disorders of glycosylation, those caused by somatic mutations are described in Chapter 46. Disorders affecting the lysosomal degradation of glycans are described in Chapter 44. Although the term “congenital disorders” by definition include those caused by nongenetic, unfavorable in utero conditions, the term “congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)” is now widely used as an equivalent of inherited disorders of glycosylation. Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33) it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found. In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations. Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms.'
 'N-glycosylation defects may be divided into two types based on transferrin glycoforms. Type I (CDG-I) patients lack one or both N-glycans because of defects in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) or its transfer to proteins. Type II (CDG-II) patients have incomplete protein-bound glycans because of abnormal processing. The biosynthetic pathways and locations of N-glycan defects are shown in Figure 45.2. Congenital disorders of glycosylation in the N-glycosylation pathway. The figure shows individual steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, glycan transfer to protein, and N-glycan processing similar to Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4. The shuttling (more...) A complete absence of N-glycans is lethal. Therefore, known mutations mostly generate hypomorphic alleles encoding proteins with diminished activity.']","Glycans play a crucial role in various biological processes, and disruptions in glycan biosynthesis or glycan-binding proteins can lead to congenital disorders. Some ways in which glycans are implicated in congenital disorders include:

1. **Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)**: CDG are a group of genetic disorders caused by defects in glycan biosynthesis and processing. These disorders can affect multiple organ systems and present with a wide range of symptoms, including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and abnormal facial features.

2. **Lysosomal storage disorders**: Glycans are involved in the degradation of cellular components within lysosomes. Defects in lysosomal enzymes involved in glycan degradation can lead to lysosomal storage disorders, such as Pompe disease and Gaucher disease, which are characterized by the accumulation of undegraded glycans and other molecules within lysosomes.

3. **Cell surface glycosylation defects**: Glycans on cell surface proteins play essential roles in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses. Mutations in genes encoding glycosyltransferases or glycan-binding proteins can lead to cell surface glycosylation defects, affecting processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and recognition, which can contribute to congenital disorders.

4. **Glycan-mediated signaling defects**: Glycans can modulate signaling pathways by interacting with receptors and other signaling molecules. Disruptions in glycan-mediated signaling pathways can impact various developmental processes, leading to congenital disorders such as skeletal dysplasias and growth disorders.

Overall, understanding the role of glycans in congenital disorders is essential for elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms of these conditions and developing potential therapeutic strategies.","Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs (congenital disorders of glycosylation) are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis.",0.45454545454545453,0.8260748618298057,0.8225676115268703,0.09090909090909091,0.9999999999666667,0.0
How are glycans typically implicated in cancer?,"['Mucins might also interfere with immune cell recognition and block or mask presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. A hallmark feature of carcinomas is the aberrant synthesis of incomplete O-glycans, present in mucins and other glycoproteins, typified by the Tn and T antigens and their sialylated glycoforms, sialyl-Tn (STn) and sialyl-T (ST) (Figure 47.2). Secreted glycoproteins expressing STn often appear in the bloodstream of patients with cancer. Because these glycans occur infrequently in normal tissues, they serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Truncated O-glycans evoke immune responses in the patient, and accordingly, vaccines against these glycans have been developed. As an alternative, incomplete O-glycans can serve as targets for a variety of therapeutic antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.'
 'Other important biomarkers include SLex-related glycans, which are used in lung and breast cancer to monitor residual disease after surgery. In recent years, there has been a major interest in glycomic profiling of serum and other body fluid glycoproteins, in addition to glycoproteins in extracellular vesicles. Classic findings of glycan-specific antibodies associated with cancer, such as the antibodies against the nonhuman Sia, Neu5Gc, are also being reinvestigated. Another potential advance lies in improving the specificity of known cancer biomarkers by defining glycoprotein glycoforms uniquely expressed by cancer cells (e.g., prostate-specific antigen). In tandem with their roles as biomarkers, glycans are important targets for cancer therapeutics. A monoclonal antibody against GD2 has been U.S.'
 'The expression of Tn and STn can enhance tumorigenic and invasive properties, and promote immunosuppression.

Tumor cells invading tissues and the bloodstream also present (more...) Sialylation is generally increased in tumor cells, both on N-glycans and O-glycans. N-glycan sialylation serves as a regulatory mechanism for multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, illustrated by activation of MET and RON receptors by α2-3Sia.

Some of the ways in which glycans are implicated in cancer include:

1. **Glycan alterations**: Changes in glycosylation patterns, such as abnormal glycan structures or altered glycosyltransferase expression, are commonly observed in cancer cells. These alterations can affect cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and immune recognition, contributing to cancer progression.

2. **Tumor cell adhesion and metastasis**: Glycans on cell surface proteins, such as selectins and integrins, mediate interactions between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Altered glycosylation can enhance tumor cell adhesion, invasion, and metastasis.

3. **Immune evasion**: Aberrant glycosylation on cancer cells can modulate immune responses by masking tumor antigens, inhibiting immune cell recognition, and promoting immune tolerance. This can help cancer cells evade immune surveillance and clearance.

4. **Angiogenesis**: Glycans are involved in regulating angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation that is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. Altered glycosylation can promote angiogenesis by modulating the activity of growth factors and adhesion molecules involved in this process.

5. **Drug resistance**: Changes in glycosylation patterns can also contribute to drug resistance in cancer cells. Altered glycan structures on drug targets or efflux transporters can affect drug binding, uptake, and efflux, leading to reduced efficacy of chemotherapy agents.

Understanding the role of glycans in cancer biology is important for developing novel diagnostic tools, therapeutic targets, and treatment strategies for cancer patients. Glycobiology research aims to uncover the complex interplay between glycans and cancer progression to improve patient outcomes.","Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression. Glycan changes in malignant cells take a variety of forms: loss of expression or excessive expression of certain glycans, increased expression of incomplete or truncated glycans, and, less commonly, the appearance of novel glycans. More specifically, studies have observed: altered branching and fucosylation of N-glycans, altered mucin expression and truncated O-glycans, altered sialic acid expression, increased selectin ligand expression, altered expression of blood groups, altered expression of glycosphingolipids, loss of GPI-anchor expression, along with several other changes in tumor cells.

Describe the basic structure of biantennary glycans,"['The depicted glycan is a biantennary glycan with branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain. However, more complex structures exist with three and four branches. Details of the synthesis and biological importance of these glycans are presented in Chapter 9. The depicted O-glycan contains a typical core structure (one of four common cores) that begins at the reducing end with an N-acetylgalactosamine α-linked to a serine or threonine (GlcNAcβ1-6[Galβ1-3]GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). It begins as a biantennary structure but can be further extended toward the nonreducing end to form more complex structures. The synthesis and biological importance of O-glycans are described in Chapters 10 (O-GalNAc) and 19 (O-GlcNAc). Examples of branched structures in N- and O-linked glycans.'
 'Branching is a prime characteristic of many glycans found on mammalian cell surfaces. Glycans representing two major types of eukaryotic protein glycosylation are shown in Figure 3.1. An N-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the side-chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue that is a part of a consensus peptide sequence NX(S/T). An O-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the terminal oxygen of a serine or threonine residue. N-Glycans contain a core composed of three mannose residues and two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Manα1-6[Manα1-3]Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-N-Asn). The depicted glycan is a biantennary glycan with branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain.'
 'The density of glycans in the glycocalyx can be remarkably high. For example, it has been calculated that the concentration of sialic acids in the glycocalyx of a typical human B lymphocyte may be >100 mm.

Nucleotides and proteins are linear polymers that can each contain only one basic type of linkage between monomers.']","Biantennary glycans are a type of complex carbohydrate structure commonly found in glycoproteins. They consist of a central core structure with two branches, or antennae, extending from each side of the core. Each branch typically contains a series of monosaccharide units linked together in a specific arrangement.

The core structure of biantennary glycans often consists of a combination of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose residues. The antennae can vary in length and composition, with different types of monosaccharides such as galactose, sialic acid, fucose, and others added to the branches.

Overall, the structure of biantennary glycans is complex and heterogeneous, with variations in branching patterns, monosaccharide composition, and linkage types contributing to the diversity of glycan structures found in biological systems.","N-glycans of the hybrid and complex type may exist with two or more GlcNAc-bearing branches that are referred to as antennae. In forming multi-antennary N-glycan structures, GlcNAc residues may be added to the trimannosyl core by six different GlcNAc transferases (I–VI). Up to five branches have been observed on N-glycans of some vertebrate glycoproteins.",0.5,0.854773815664467,0.7580465345556047,0.05555555555555555,0.49999999995,0.0
What functions do biantennary N-glycans typically serve?,"['Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain. This becomes particularly evident when recombinant glycoprotein molecules are produced in biotechnology, bearing different glycosylation patterns based on the evolutionary history of the cell expression system in use (bacterial, yeast, insect, nonhuman mammal, or human). The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells. In the embryonic state, or in other states of neural “plasticity,” polySia chains tend to be long, thereby interfering with homophilic binding (Chapter 15).'
 'A further structural function of glycans is to act as a protective storage depot (“sponge”) for biologically important molecules. For example, many heparin-binding growth factors (Chapters 17 and 38) bind glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of the extracellular matrix, adjacent to cells that need to be stimulated (e.g., in the basement membrane underlying epithelial and endothelial cells). This prevents diffusion of factors away from the site of secretion (sometimes generating morphogenic gradients), protects them from nonspecific proteolysis, prolongs their active lives, and allows them to be released under specific conditions. Likewise, GAG chains in secretory granules can bind and protect protein contents of the granule and modulate their functions. There are several other instances in which glycans act as sinks or depots for biologically important molecules, such as water, ions, and immune regulatory proteins.'
 'Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them. Biological functions of glycans can be divided into three broad categories: (1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs]) (Figure 7.1). The GBPs can be subdivided into two groups: (1) intrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from the same organism and (2) extrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from another organism. Intrinsic GBPs typically mediate cell–cell interactions or recognize extracellular molecules, but they can also recognize glycans on the glycocalyx of same cell.']","Biantennary N-glycans are a common type of N-linked glycan structure found on glycoproteins. They serve several important functions, including:

1. **Protein folding and stability:** N-glycans can assist in protein folding and stability by promoting proper protein folding and preventing protein aggregation.

2. **Cell-cell recognition:** N-glycans can mediate cell-cell recognition and adhesion processes, which are important for various biological functions such as immune response, development, and cell signaling.

3. **Protein trafficking:** N-glycans play a role in protein trafficking within cells, including sorting and targeting of glycoproteins to specific cellular compartments.

4. **Regulation of protein function:** N-glycans can modulate the activity and function of glycoproteins by affecting their interactions with other molecules, such as ligands or receptors.

5. **Immune response:** N-glycans can influence the immune response by serving as antigens or by modulating the recognition of glycoproteins by immune cells.

Overall, biantennary N-glycans play diverse and important roles in various biological processes, highlighting the significance of glycans in cellular functions.","Biantennary N-glycan structure with two terminal alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids is a common and optimal structure that is able to enhance the activities of antibodies against cancer, influenza, and inflammatory diseases.",0.14285714285714285,0.8879863969863173,0.6651199167697786,0.06666666666666667,0.3333333333,0.0
"How does glycosylation affect the stability and function of therapeutic proteins, and what strategies are used to optimize glycan profiles?","['Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation. Sialidases and other glycosidases that are either secreted or released by dead cells can also degrade the previously intact product in the culture medium. These issues were hotly debated with the advent of “biosimilars” or generic versions of glycoproteins. The need to prove composition has fueled efforts devoted to glycan analysis and sequencing. Patenting new therapeutics is typically based on the composition of matter in the claimed molecule. Small molecules of defined structure and nonglycosylated proteins are easily captured in this manner.'
 'This suggests that one must consider all the known glycogenes in a mammalian cell line for glycoengineering strategies. Engineering the glycosylation capacity of CHO cells has also enabled more homogeneous bioconjugation of therapeutic drugs. For example, therapeutic drugs may be chemically conjugated with PEG chains to enhance circulatory half-life, but chemical conjugation is difficult to direct to specific sites in glycoproteins. A strategy for enzymatic modification of glycans postproduction has been developed that involves desialylation of recombinant glycoproteins, followed by in vitro transfer of a modified (PEGylated) Neu5Ac (as its CMP analog) to exposed Gal/GalNAc residues by a sialyltransferase. The process is in use with approved drugs, although heterogeneous modifications occur when multiantennary N-glycans are targeted.'
 'This is currently addressed by ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through the use of highly standardized bioprocessing protocols, but this strategy is far from optimal. For example, incompletely sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins may be cleared by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell–Morell receptor), resulting in inconsistent circulatory half-lives of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 34). Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sialylation by overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases as well as inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases in host cells. Protein-specific glycosylation patterns and heterogeneity are more difficult to control. Nonhuman mammalian cell lines can produce two immunogenic nonhuman glycans: α1-3-Gal added to N-acetyllactosamine and Neu5Gc added to Gal or GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 15).']","Glycosylation plays a crucial role in the stability and function of therapeutic proteins. The presence of glycans can influence the protein's folding, stability, solubility, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biological activity. The specific impact of glycosylation on a therapeutic protein can vary depending on the protein itself and the site of glycosylation.

To optimize glycan profiles and enhance the stability and function of therapeutic proteins, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Cell line engineering**: Selecting an appropriate expression system and cell line can help control the glycosylation patterns of the therapeutic protein. For example, using mammalian cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells can result in human-like glycosylation patterns.

2. **Glycoengineering**: This involves modifying the glycosylation pathways in the host cell to produce desired glycan structures. Techniques such as gene knockout, knock-in, or overexpression of glycosyltransferases can be used to manipulate glycan profiles.

3. **Culture conditions**: Modifying the culture conditions, such as media composition, pH, temperature, and oxygen levels, can influence glycosylation patterns. Optimal conditions can be determined to achieve the desired glycan profiles.

4. **Enzymatic glycoengineering**: Enzymatic modification of glycans post-expression can be used to alter glycan structures. Enzymes such as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases can be employed to trim, add, or modify specific glycan residues.

5. **Purification methods**: The choice of purification method can impact glycan profiles. Techniques such as affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography can selectively retain or remove certain glycan structures.

6. **Analytical techniques**: Utilizing advanced analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, and high-performance liquid chromatography can help characterize and monitor glycan profiles to ensure consistency and quality of the therapeutic protein.

By employing these strategies, researchers can optimize glycan profiles to enhance the stability, efficacy, and safety of therapeutic proteins. It is essential to consider the specific requirements of the therapeutic protein and the desired biological activity when designing glycoengineering approaches.","Glycosylation can also enhance the stability of the protein therapeutic against proteolytic degradation, oxidation, precipitation, and denaturation. As glycosylation can shield hydrophobic regions on the glycoprotein’s surface, it can prevent protein aggregation, which can help decrease immunogenicity. Glycosylation can also hide immunogenetic protein epitopes on the glycoprotein’s surface. While glycosylation has many effects on glycoprotein drugs, it’s challenging to ensure that the final drug product has desired glycosylation patterns. The glycosylation patterns on a protein can be heterogeneous in terms of where the modification occurs and the modification itself.",0.875,0.9147085377078096,0.8004273271120018,0.11764705882352941,0.9999999999666667,0.6
Can you explain the concept of glycan microarrays and their application in studying glycan-protein interactions?,"['Microarrays in which a variety of lectins and antibodies are printed on a slide can also give valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. This approach is especially sensitive in regard to defining whether biological samples differ in glycosylation. For example, such microarrays have been used to identify glycosylation differences in melanoma metastasis, leading to the identification of core fucose as a critical determinant of metastatic potential. There are several approaches to using antibodies and lectins in glycan purification, including affinity chromatography or affinity binding and immunoprecipitation or lectin-induced precipitation. The proteins may be covalently coupled to a carrier such as Sepharose or biotinylated and captured on streptavidin-Sepharose. In addition, antibodies may be noncovalently captured on protein A (or G)-Sepharose. These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants.'
 'The use of glass slides, microarray printing technology, and surface patterning of engineered glycophages displaying unique carbohydrate epitopes allows the production of glycan microarrays with the potential to examine binding of all types of GBPs (lectins, antiglycan monoclonal or serum antibodies, and glycan-binding cytokines or chemokines) to several thousand unique glycans, simultaneously. Binding is assessed by fluorescent or spectrometric techniques.'
 'Lectin precipitation and aggregation can be used to define the glycan composition and overall architecture of polysaccharides, as has been done for bacterial, algal, plant, and animal polysaccharides. Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. Fluorescent-tagged glycoproteins from a source (e.g., cell or tissue extracts) can be applied to these arrays and the binding pattern compared to a control sample can reveal features of the glycome of the material, such as patterns of sialylation, fucosylation, and even linkages of residues with glycans using linkage-specific reagents.']","Certainly! Glycan microarrays are high-throughput screening platforms that display a diverse set of glycans in a spatially defined manner on a solid surface, such as a glass slide or a chip. These arrays allow researchers to investigate interactions between glycans and other biomolecules, such as proteins, antibodies, or viruses, in a systematic and comprehensive manner.

In the context of studying glycan-protein interactions, glycan microarrays are particularly valuable tools. By immobilizing a wide variety of glycans on the array surface, researchers can screen for specific interactions between these glycans and proteins of interest. This can help identify novel glycan-binding proteins, characterize the binding specificities of known proteins, and elucidate the roles of glycan-protein interactions in various biological processes.

Researchers can use glycan microarrays to study a range of biological questions, such as identifying glycan receptors for pathogens, investigating the role of glycans in cell signaling pathways, and understanding the mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. The high-throughput nature of glycan microarrays allows for rapid screening of large numbers of samples, making them a powerful tool for glycan research.

Overall, glycan microarrays provide a valuable platform for studying glycan-protein interactions, enabling researchers to gain insights into the complex roles of glycans in biological systems.","Glycan microarrays consist of a panel of glycans immobilized on a microchip that can be used to evaluate binding specificity of glycan-binding proteins. This technology can be used in many specific services such as Glycoprotein Structure Analysis, Glycoprotein Quantification, High Throughput Glycan Screening Service, Tumor Glyco-diag Service, and Anti-Glycoprotein Antibody Development.",0.8666666666666667,0.9279110857089394,0.8635904273815875,0.07692307692307693,0.9999999999666667,0.5
"What are the computational methods available for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data, and what are their limitations?","['Ion mobility mass spectrometry additionally separates ions based on their size and shape which can resolve glycan structural isomers with the same mass to charge ratio (see Further Reading). Broadly speaking, the unique strengths of MS can be exploited in two general ways in glycobiology. The first is to obtain detailed characterization of purified individual glycans or mixtures of glycans. In this type of study, it is essential to acquire sufficient rigorous data to define structure unambiguously; many different MS-based experiments will be required, often complemented by NMR, linkage analysis, and profiling of enzyme digests. The second is to pursue glycomics investigations in situations in which it may not be essential to define structures fully, and high-throughput glycomic profiling or mass-mapping procedures in combination with specific glycosylhydrolases can be exploited (Chapter 51). NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of full de novo structural characterization of isolated glycans and simple glycan mixtures.'
 'In MS/MS experiments, permethylated derivatives form abundant fragment ions produced by cleavage at susceptible glycosidic linkages, notably on the reducing side of each HexNAc residue. In N- and O-glycans, this preferred fragmentation unambiguously establishes the antennae sequences. MALDI- and ESI-MS can equally be applied to the characterization of glycolipid and GAG derived glycans. However, in the latter case, because of the size and high degree of sulfation of GAGs, MS analysis is usually performed after hydrolysis of the polymeric chain. As described above, mass spectrometry measures the mass to charge ratio of glycans during the analytical process. However, as multiple monosaccharides that make up a glycan can have the same mass (e.g., mannose, galactose and glucose) and monosaccharides can be linked together in different ways, a single peak in a glycan mass spectrum can actually be made up of multiple structural isomers.'
 'NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of full de novo structural characterization of isolated glycans and simple glycan mixtures. Among its several advantages are its broad applicability (glycans contain an abundance of hydrogen (1H), the most easily detected magnetic nucleus), its nondestructive nature, the quantitative relationship between resonance intensity and residue concentration, the diverse set of experiments available, and the ability to return information on primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Its principal limitation is sensitivity, typically requiring several nanomoles of glycan for even the simplest structure determination. Other limitations for both structural and metabolic applications are the relatively high cost of spectrometers and the level of expertise required for acquiring and interpreting NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there are emerging experiments using methods, such as dynamic nuclear polarization and looped, projected spectroscopy (L-PROSY), that provide several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for applications that can monitor rapid in vivo conversions of metabolites such as glucose and fructose.']","There are several computational methods available for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data. Some of the commonly used methods include:

1. GlycoDeNovo: This software tool uses a combinatorial approach to predict glycan structures from tandem mass spectrometry data. It generates all possible glycan structures based on the observed fragment ions and ranks them according to their match with the experimental data.

2. GlycoWorkbench: This is an open-source software platform that provides tools for glycan structure elucidation from mass spectrometry data. It allows users to input experimental data and search against a database of known glycan structures to identify potential matches.

3. GlycoFragment: This tool predicts glycan structures by fragmenting them into smaller substructures and comparing these fragments with experimental mass spectrometry data. It uses a scoring system to rank the candidate structures based on their match with the observed ions.

4. GlycoHunter: This software tool uses a probabilistic model to predict glycan structures from mass spectrometry data. It considers the likelihood of different glycosidic linkages and monosaccharide compositions to generate a list of candidate structures.

Limitations of these computational methods include:

1. Database coverage: The accuracy of glycan structure prediction heavily relies on the completeness and accuracy of the glycan structure databases used by these tools. Limited database coverage can lead to incorrect or incomplete predictions.

2. Structural complexity: Predicting complex glycan structures with multiple branching points and isomeric forms can be challenging for computational methods. The algorithms may struggle to differentiate between structurally similar glycans.

3. Fragmentation patterns: The interpretation of mass spectrometry data and the prediction of glycan structures are influenced by the fragmentation patterns generated during the experiment. Variability in fragmentation can lead to ambiguity in structure prediction.

4. Computational resources: Some of these computational methods require significant computational resources and expertise to run effectively. Users may need access to high-performance computing resources or specialized software environments.

Overall, while computational methods can provide valuable insights into glycan structure prediction from mass spectrometry data, researchers should be aware of the limitations and carefully validate the results obtained from these tools.","Currently, structural determination of glycans is, at best, semi-manual and proceeds structure by structure. Since different glycan structures can result in the same mass, structural isomers are routinely separated via liquid chromatography (LC), followed by fragmentation into smaller substructures by MS, conceptually akin to shotgun sequencing. Current in-depth workflows are hard to parallelize, with a general trade-off between resolution and scale. All this has relegated structural glycomics to a few experts, inaccessible to most life science researchers. Nuances of diagnostic indicators are challenging for humans to decrypt manually or encode programmatically, especially at scale and while accommodating diverse experimental setups, as each linkage and monosaccharide can be affected by its sequence context.",0.0,0.9329699813599789,0.7242763730131474,0.11764705882352941,0.99999999995,0.0
"What are the structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines, and how does this binding regulate cellular signaling pathways?","['Indeed, few membrane receptors have been described in which sulfated GAGs binding causes a specific downstream response, such as phosphorylation of the receptor or activation of a kinase. Instead, sulfated GAGs bind to many ligand/receptor pairs, thereby lowering the effective concentration of ligand required to engage the receptor or increasing the duration of the response. An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase. These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix.'
 'Many other sulfated GAG-binding proteins were later discovered by affinity chromatography using columns of immobilized heparin. Growth factors and cytokines bearing clusters of positively charged amino acids along their protein surface interact with sulfated GAGs in a looser fashion—that is, they do not always show the high specificity seen with antithrombin. However, in some cases, specific GAG sequences mediate the formation of higher-order complexes, acting as a template for oligomerization or positioning of proteins such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its cell-surface receptor. GBPs function in communication between cells in multicellular organisms and in interactions between microbes and hosts and can also be involved in binding growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. These interactions can take various forms, resulting in movement of molecules, cells, and information. Directing movement of glycoproteins within and between cells is a common function for lectins in many organisms.'
 'Hyaluronan oligosaccharides bind to specific membrane proteins, including CD44. In some cells, this binding leads to clustering of CD44, which activates kinases such as c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 with regulatory and adaptor molecules that modulate cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell survival and proliferation (Figure 16.6). Signaling by hyaluronan oligosaccharides depends on the DP of the glycans. Low molecular weight glycans are more active in triggering danger responses via binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In contrast to hyaluronan-dependent signal transduction, signaling via sulfated GAGs such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate occurs by an indirect mechanism.']","Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell signaling. The structural determinants of GAGs that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines include the composition of the disaccharide units, the sulfation pattern, and the overall sulfation density along the GAG chain.

1. **Composition of Disaccharide Units**: The specific arrangement of monosaccharides in the disaccharide units of GAGs, such as the presence of uronic acid residues (e.g., glucuronic acid or iduronic acid) and amino sugars (e.g., N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), contributes to the unique binding properties of GAGs to different proteins.

2. **Sulfation Pattern**: Sulfation of GAGs at specific positions within the disaccharide units (e.g., 2-O, 6-O, or N-sulfation) is critical for their interactions with growth factors and cytokines. The sulfation pattern determines the affinity and specificity of GAG-protein interactions.

3. **Sulfation Density**: The overall sulfation density along the GAG chain influences the strength of binding to proteins. Higher sulfation density generally leads to stronger interactions with growth factors and cytokines.

The binding of GAGs to growth factors and cytokines regulates cellular signaling pathways through several mechanisms:

1. **Sequestration and Presentation**: GAGs can sequester growth factors and cytokines, preventing their degradation and enhancing their stability. GAGs can also present these proteins to their respective receptors on the cell surface, facilitating receptor-ligand interactions.

2. **Signal Modulation**: GAGs can modulate the signaling activity of growth factors and cytokines by regulating their diffusion, distribution, and availability in the extracellular matrix. This can impact the duration and intensity of signaling pathways activated by these proteins.

3. **Co-receptor Function**: GAGs can act as co-receptors for growth factors and cytokines, enhancing their binding to cell surface receptors and promoting downstream signaling events. This co-receptor function can amplify or fine-tune cellular responses to extracellular stimuli.

Overall, the specific binding of GAGs to growth factors and cytokines, mediated by their structural determinants, plays a crucial role in regulating cellular signaling pathways involved in processes such as development, tissue repair, and inflammation.","In general, the biological activity and binding affinity of GAGs is dictated by their sulfation pattern, disaccharide unit sequence and 3D conformation; however, GAGs are also capable of unspecific binding of other positively charged proteins due to the negative charge provided by their numerous sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. Many proteins also contain specific evolutionarily conserved GAG-binding domains that mediate specific protein-GAG interactions. These domains often contain basic amino acids with small polar side chains (i.e. lysine and arginine), allowing flexibility and minimal steric hindrance for interaction with GAGs.",0.0,0.8982379673311713,0.7767636317930611,0.1111111111111111,0.9999999999666667,0.25
"How does glycosylation impact the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, such as folding, stability, and oligomerization, and what are the implications for drug targeting?","['The expression of many of these proteins increases during stress responses. Unlike cytoplasmic proteins, most membrane and secreted proteins undergo modification with N-glycans (Figure 39.1) as they enter the ER lumen. Oligosaccharyltransferase requires flexible domains of a polypeptide for glycosylation, and thus N-glycosylation evolved in eukaryotes to occur before protein folding. Accordingly, N-linked glycans affect the folding of glycoproteins directly by altering the biophysical properties of the protein. They can serve as signals to localize the folding machinery and to signal the folding status of the polypeptide. To achieve glycan-mediated folding, N-glycans are recognized by two lectin-like chaperones in the ER: calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT).'
 'Some growth factor receptors acquire their binding abilities in a glycosylation-dependent manner while in transit through the Golgi apparatus. This may limit unwanted early interactions of a newly synthesized receptor with a growth factor that is synthesized in the same cell. Glycosylation of a polypeptide can also mediate an on–off switching effect. For example, when the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotrophin is deglycosylated, it still binds to its receptor with similar affinity, but it fails to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In most instances, the effects of glycosylation are incomplete; that is, glycosylation appears to be “tuning” a primary function of the protein rather than turning it on or off. For example, the activity of some glycosylated growth factors and hormones can be modulated over a wide range by the extent and type of their glycosylation. Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain.'
 'N-Butylation of deoxynojirimycin makes this glucosidase inhibitor an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis, which is discussed in more detail further below. In other cases, alkylation of the amino group or acylation of the hydroxyl groups can improve the potency of the compound, presumably by facilitating uptake across the plasma and Golgi membranes. Some of these compounds have shown positive effects for treating diabetes, cancer, HIV infection, and lysosomal storage diseases (see Chapter 57), but some also induce male sterility. A major challenge with all of these enzymes is their limited specificity; thus while convenient and widely used, some caution is needed when interpreting resulting observations. The importance of O-GlcNAc addition to many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) has stimulated interest in developing agents to inhibit its addition by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or its removal by O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]).']","Glycosylation plays a crucial role in modulating the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, including their folding, stability, and oligomerization. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Folding**: Glycosylation can influence the folding of membrane proteins by affecting their conformation and stability. The addition of glycans can act as folding chaperones, guiding the correct folding of the protein. In some cases, glycosylation may be required for proper protein folding to occur.

2. **Stability**: Glycosylation can enhance the stability of membrane proteins by providing additional interactions within the protein structure. The glycans can shield the protein from proteolytic degradation and denaturation, thereby increasing its overall stability.

3. **Oligomerization**: Glycosylation can also impact the oligomerization of membrane proteins, influencing their interactions with other proteins or forming higher-order complexes. Glycans can mediate protein-protein interactions and stabilize protein complexes, leading to the formation of functional oligomeric structures.

4. **Implications for drug targeting**: Understanding the role of glycosylation in modulating the biophysical properties of membrane proteins is crucial for drug targeting. Since glycosylation can affect protein folding, stability, and oligomerization, targeting specific glycosylation sites or glycan structures could potentially modulate the function of membrane proteins and their interactions with drugs.

In drug development, targeting glycosylation pathways or specific glycan structures on membrane proteins could offer new opportunities for therapeutic interventions. By manipulating glycosylation patterns, researchers may be able to modulate the activity of membrane proteins involved in disease pathways, potentially leading to the development of novel drug targets or therapeutic strategies.

Overall, the impact of glycosylation on the biophysical properties of membrane proteins underscores the importance of considering glycan structures in drug targeting strategies and understanding their role in protein function and regulation.","Glycosylation has been shown to ameliorate a multitude of pharmaceutically-relevant chemical and physical protein instabilities. Mechanistically, the different glycosylation parameters (e.g., number of glycans attached and glycan molecular size) studied so far can apparently impart different stabilization effects on the protein. While increasing the glycosylation degree apparently stabilizes the protein native state by increasing the internal non-covalent forces and rigidifying the protein structure, increasing the glycan molecular size appears to destabilize the protein unfolded state.",1.0,0.8183667950763003,0.7316389296869293,0.05555555555555555,0.99999999995,0.25
Explain the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition,"['Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses. Perhaps not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved this state of molecular mimicry by making use of “every possible trick in the book,” including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer. In some instances, the impact of the pathogen is aggravated by autoimmune reactions, resulting from host reactions to these self-like antigens.'
 'Likewise, various toxins bind with great specificity to certain gangliosides but not to the same glycan epitopes presented on proteins (Chapters 11 and 37). There is little doubt about the importance of structural specificity with respect to these functions of glycans. Indeed, some of the microbial binding proteins involved have been harnessed as molecular probes for studying the expression of their cognate glycans. However, providing such signposts to aid the success of pathogenic microorganisms has little obvious value to the organism that synthesized such glycans. To counter such deleterious consequences, some organisms have also evolved the ability to mask or modify glycans recognized by microorganisms or toxins. Meanwhile, glycan sequences on soluble glycoconjugates, such as secreted mucins, act as decoys for microorganisms and parasites. Thus, a pathogenic organism or toxin evolving to bind to mucosal cell membranes may first encounter its cognate ligand attached to a soluble mucin, which can then be washed away, removing the danger to cells underneath.'
 'This complex initiates a signaling cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately lead to the transcription of proinflammatory genes. In contrast to PAMPs and DAMPs, inhibitory Siglec receptors (Chapter 35) on mammal innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialylated glycoconjugates as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) and dampen unwanted immune reactions against the host. Details of the sialoglycan specificity involved require further investigation, but pathogens take advantage of the system via molecular mimicry (Chapters 7 and 42). Plants also exhibit a type of innate immunity that on activation could confer resistance to pathogen attack to the entire plant. Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops.']","Glycan shielding refers to the phenomenon where glycans (sugar molecules) attached to proteins or lipids on the surface of cells or viruses can act as a protective barrier against immune recognition. This shielding is significant in evading immune surveillance and promoting immune evasion strategies in various biological contexts. Here are some key points to understand the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition:

1. **Masking of antigenic epitopes**: Glycans can cover or mask antigenic epitopes on proteins or pathogens, making them less recognizable to the immune system. This can prevent the binding of antibodies or immune cells that would otherwise target and eliminate the cell or pathogen.

2. **Modulation of immune cell interactions**: Glycans can interact with receptors on immune cells, modulating their activity and preventing them from recognizing and attacking the cell or pathogen. For example, sialic acid-containing glycans can interact with Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) on immune cells, leading to inhibitory signaling and dampening immune responses.

3. **Promotion of immune tolerance**: Certain glycans, such as those found on self-antigens or commensal bacteria, can promote immune tolerance by inducing regulatory immune cell responses. This helps prevent inappropriate immune responses against self-antigens or beneficial microbes.

4. **Enhancement of pathogen survival**: Pathogens can exploit glycan shielding to evade immune detection and clearance. By decorating their surface with host-like glycans or shielding antigenic epitopes with glycans, pathogens can avoid immune recognition and enhance their survival within the host.

5. **Role in chronic infections and cancer**: Glycan shielding is implicated in chronic infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, where the virus mutates its glycan shield to evade immune responses. Similarly, cancer cells often upregulate specific glycans to evade immune surveillance and promote tumor growth.

Understanding the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition is crucial for developing strategies to overcome immune evasion mechanisms employed by pathogens or cancer cells. By targeting specific glycans or glycan-binding proteins involved in shielding, researchers can potentially enhance immune recognition and clearance of harmful entities, leading to the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","Glycan shielding is utilized by some enveloped viruses to evade immune system targeting by their host. These viruses typically adopt host gylcosylation during synthesis of the protein envelope, allowing antigens to be modified so that host antibodies are unable to recognize them, thereby preventing immune response to viral infection. As a result, some organisms develop antibodies that specifically target foreign glycoproteins in order to identify pathogens that may have adopted glycosylation patterns from another individual.",0.42857142857142855,0.836248431346257,0.7934050483955223,0.0625,0.9999999999666667,0.3333333333333333
How is hemoglobin involved in glycan biosynthesis?,"['These modified proteins are thought to underlie some of the pathologies associated with diabetes. Two monosaccharide units can be joined together by a glycosidic bond—this is the fundamental linkage among the monosaccharide building blocks found in all oligosaccharides. The glycosidic bond is formed between the anomeric carbon of one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group of another. In chemical terms, a hemiacetal group reacts with an alcohol group to form an acetal. Glycosidic bonds can be formed with virtually any hydroxylated compound, including simple alcohols such as methanol (Figure 2.13) or hydroxy amino acids such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Indeed, glycosidic linkages are formed between sugars and these amino acids within proteins to form glycoproteins (see Chapters 9 and 10).'
 'Biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan begins with the transfer of GlcNAc-phosphate, derived from a nucleotide-activated precursor, onto an unusually short and highly saturated Dol-PP lipid carrier by AglH, a UDP-GlcNAc-1-P: Dol-P-GlcNAc-1-P transferase. Information concerning addition of the second and third sugars is lacking. However, Agl3 converts UDP-glucose and sodium sulphite into UDP-sulfoquinovose, which is subsequently added to Dol-PP-bound trisaccharide by an unknown glycosyltransferase. In the final steps of N-linked glycan assembly, the terminal mannose and glucose moieties are added, with Agl16, a soluble glycosyltransferase, adding the final glucose. A so-far unidentified flippase translocates the Dol-PP-bound hexasaccharide across the membrane, where AglB transfers the glycan to target protein Asn residues. In contrast to Hfx.'
 'Depending on the strain, this modification can be extended into longer structures containing GlcNAc or glucose/galactose residues. These glycoproteins are exported by an accessory secretion (SecA2/Y2) system and the glycan modification appears to play a role in modulating the adhesive properties of the bacterium. Haemophilus influenzae also modifies high molecular weight adhesions 1 (HMW1) prior to export. HMW1 is modified at some 31 asparagine residues, predominantly in the N-X-S/T amino acid motif, with mono- or dihexose modifications containing glucose and galactose. Glycosylation is initiated and extended by HMW1C (NGT), an enzyme with homology to the O-GlcNAc transferase. Of note, HMW1C uses UDP-Glucose and UDP-Galactose to initiate and extend glycans in a stepwise manner.']","Hemoglobin itself is not directly involved in glycan biosynthesis. Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Glycan biosynthesis, on the other hand, refers to the process by which glycans (complex sugar molecules) are synthesized and attached to proteins or lipids in cells.

However, some proteins involved in glycan biosynthesis may interact with hemoglobin or be regulated by hemoglobin levels in the body. For example, enzymes involved in glycan biosynthesis may be affected by changes in oxygen levels that can impact hemoglobin function. Additionally, some glycans may be attached to hemoglobin itself or to other proteins that interact with hemoglobin.

Overall, while hemoglobin and glycan biosynthesis are not directly related processes, there may be indirect connections between them in the context of cellular physiology and metabolism.",Hemoglobin is involved in oxygen transport and does not participate in glycan biosynthesis.,0.3076923076923077,0.9219618621725353,0.7605828293844424,0.05555555555555555,0.9999999999,0.0
Does glycan synthesis occur in the mitochondria or the nucleus?,"['Similar studies have documented the presence of nuclear mannosyltransferases. The finding that CMP (cytidine 5′-monophosphate)-sialic acid is synthesized in the mammalian nucleus offers further support for the concept of nuclear glycosyltransferases. Although these studies are provocative, they must also be interpreted with caution. The rER, which is the widely accepted site of N-glycosylation (Chapter 9), is functionally contiguous with the outer nuclear envelope, which also can fold into the interior. Even a minor contamination of nuclear envelope could lead to misinterpretation of enzyme assays. Also, it is very difficult to purify nuclei such that other cellular components do not nonspecifically adhere to the otherwise “pure” nuclei during their preparation. Given these potential problems, widespread acceptance of the existence of these nuclear glycosyltransferases must await independent confirmation by alternative methods.'
 'A classical model envisioned that these enzymes are physically lined up along this pathway in the precise sequence in which they actually work. This model appears to be oversimplified, as there is considerable overlap in the distribution of these enzymes, and the actual distribution of a given enzyme depends on the cell type. All topological considerations mentioned above are reversed with regard to nuclear and cytoplasmic glycosylation, because the active sites of the relevant glycosyltransferases face the cytosol, which is in direct communication with the interior of the nucleus. Until the mid-1980s, the accepted dogma was that glycoconjugates occurred exclusively on the outer surface of cells, on the internal (luminal) surface of intracellular organelles, and on secreted molecules. The cytosol and nucleus were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. However, it is now clear that certain distinct types of glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within the cytosol and nucleus (Chapter 18).'
 'Almost all donors for glycosylation reactions and glycan modifications are synthesized within the cytosolic compartment, from precursors of endogenous origin. In eukaryotes, most of these donors are actively transported across a membrane bilayer by specific multipass transporter proteins, becoming available for reactions within the lumen of the ER–Golgi pathway. For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments. Indeed, one of them (O-linked GlcNAc; Chapter 19) may well be quantitatively the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cells.']","Glycan synthesis primarily occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus within the cell, rather than in the mitochondria or the nucleus. The ER is the site where the initial steps of glycan synthesis take place, while the Golgi apparatus is responsible for further processing and modification of glycans. Mitochondria are primarily involved in energy production, and the nucleus is responsible for housing the cell's genetic material.","Glycan synthesis takes place primarily in the Golgi Apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum. The mitochondria and nucleus are principally involved in energy production and gene expression, respectively.",0.3333333333333333,0.7425767091056437,0.8972989081793479,0.05555555555555555,0.5833333333041666,0.0
Which glycosidases are involved in glycosylating p53?,"['Hypomorphic mutations in multiple genes in the pathway lead to a partial reduction in GPI-anchored proteins. These include PIGA, PIGH, PIGQ, PIGY, PIGC, PIGP, PIGL, PIGW, PIGM, PIGV, PIGB, PIGF, and PIGO in GPI-anchor assembly (Table 45.1), and PIGK, GPAA1, PIGS, PIGT, and PIGU in the transfer of the GPI anchor to proteins. Defects in side-chain modifications (PIGN and PIGG) and maturation of the GPI glycan following attachment to proteins (PGAP1, PGAP2, and PGAP3) also cause inherited GPI deficiency, but not embryonic death.'
 'Disaccharides that can enter the cell and act as decoys to divert glycosylation pathways are also showing promise (Chapter 55). Recently, there has been growing interest in targeting glycan-dependent molecular interactions to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition. N-glycosylation is important for stabilization of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule, as well as recognition by PD-1. Thus, therapeutic interference with PD-L1 glycosylation could provide a mechanism for hindering the activation of PD-1 on immune cells. The sialoglycan–Siglec interaction represents another critical immune checkpoint, and function-blocking antibodies against select Siglecs have entered clinical trials. Additionally, methods are being developed to block or ablate tumor cell Sia ligands for Siglecs via administration of sialic acid mimetics or the targeted delivery of sialidases to tumor cell surfaces.'
 'Loss-of-function mutations in the FGE gene lead to inactive sulfatases. This deficit affects GAG degradation and any other sulfated glycan such as sulfatides. Glycosphingolipids (Chapter 11) are degraded from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases while they are still bound to the lipid moiety ceramide. Because glycosphingolipids share some of the same outer sugar sequences found in N- and O-glycans (Chapter 14), many of the same glycosidases are used for their degradation (Figure 44.4). However, specific hydrolases cleave the glucose–ceramide and galactose–ceramide bonds. Besides specific enzymes, noncatalytic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) help to present the lipid substrates to enzymes for cleavage.']","Glycosidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. They are not involved in glycosylating proteins like p53. Instead, glycosyltransferases are the enzymes responsible for adding sugar moieties to proteins like p53.

Describe computational methods for predicting glycan structure based on a DNA sequence,"[""Therefore PDB entries now contain glycan annotations, which are available in LINUCS, GLYCAM (IUPAC-like), and WURCS formats. Despite the known sequon (NXT/S, X is not Pro) for N-linked glycosylation, many potential sites are not glycosylated in vivo, and there are no clear motif(s) for predicting O-linked glycosylation. Understanding the “rules'' of attachment site specificity for the glycosylation of proteins is thus an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. Over the past 20 years, neural networks, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been implemented to predict N- or O-glycosylation and C-mannosylation. Although the original tools were hosted on the Danish CBS Prediction Servers, additional resources have emerged in the last few years.""
 'SugarBind is a curated database of literature-derived knowledge of pathogen–glycan binding, and MatrixDB collects glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Because of their inherent flexibility, oligosaccharides typically exist in solution or on proteins, as an ensemble of conformations, making it a challenge to describe their 3D structure (see Chapters 30 and 50 for a description of 3D structures). Computational chemistry is an essential tool in analyzing glycan experimental data, to make predictions that may be tested experimentally, and to unravel and explain chemical processes at the atomic level. Web-based tools are available to generate a theoretical model of a carbohydrate 3D structure. A useful resource is GLYCAM-Web that provides tools for modeling oligosaccharides and glycoproteins in addition to providing downloadable structure files that can be used for molecular modeling. SWEET-II is also a carbohydrate 3D builder that is available on the GLYCOSCIENCES.de website.'
 ""Furthermore, glycans are often highly branched and their structures cannot be described as a simple linear sequence (Chapter 3). The critical role of glycomics in systems biology. Glycan structures have no template from which to be predicted, are regulated by cellular metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and modify both proteins and lipids. Glycomics thus requires the tools (more...) Because of this biosynthetic and structural complexity, it is not currently possible to accurately predict the structures of the glycans that an organism can produce under different environments or how these glycans are conjugated with other molecules, armed only with knowledge of the genome or proteome. Rather, the identity of each glycan in a biological sample must be identified using analytical methods (Chapter 50 and Chapter 51) that are sufficiently sophisticated to detect and discern the glycan's diverse structural features. Thus, research aimed at understanding the biological roles and consequences of glycan structures depends on the availability of integrated glycoinformatics databases.""]","Computational methods for predicting glycan structures based on a DNA sequence typically involve a series of steps that leverage bioinformatics tools and databases. Here is an overview of the general approach:

1. **DNA Sequence Retrieval**: The first step is to retrieve the DNA sequence of the gene encoding the glycoprotein of interest. This can be obtained from public databases such as GenBank or UniProt.

2. **Prediction of Protein Sequence**: The DNA sequence is then translated into the corresponding protein sequence using bioinformatics tools. This step is crucial as glycosylation typically occurs on specific amino acid residues within the protein.

3. **Prediction of Glycosylation Sites**: Various bioinformatics tools are available for predicting potential glycosylation sites on the protein sequence. These tools utilize algorithms that analyze the protein sequence for known glycosylation motifs or patterns.

4. **Glycan Structure Prediction**: Once potential glycosylation sites are identified, the next step is to predict the possible glycan structures that could be attached to these sites. This can be done using bioinformatics tools that take into account the enzyme specificities involved in glycan biosynthesis pathways.

5. **Database Search and Comparison**: The predicted glycan structures can be compared with known glycan structures in databases such as GlyTouCan or GlyGen to identify similar glycans and infer potential functions or interactions.

6. **Validation and Experimental Confirmation**: It is important to note that computational predictions are based on algorithms and models, and experimental validation is necessary to confirm the predicted glycan structures. Techniques such as mass spectrometry, glycan microarrays, and glycoproteomics can be used for experimental validation.

Overall, computational methods for predicting glycan structures based on a DNA sequence provide valuable insights into the potential glycosylation patterns of a protein, aiding in the understanding of glycan-mediated biological processes.","Glycosylation is a post-translational modification that is not derived from genetic information. Thus, it is impossible to predict using current computational methods from DNA sequence data.",0.0,0.9383525893593395,0.7056287624562286,0.058823529411764705,0.9999999999666667,1.0
Why do plants and animals express similar repetoires of glycans despite their vastly different physiology?,"['If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species.'
 'For many taxa, there is a lack of any information on glycan profiles. Sufficient data are available to indicate that even though all living cells require a glycocalyx (a dense and complex array of cell-surface glycans), there is no evidence for a universal “glycan code,” akin to the genetic code. Importantly, glycan structures are not directly encoded in the genome. They are synthesized and modified by a network of enzymes in a template-independent manner, and glycophenotypes represent the outcome of co-expressed gene networks and nutrients. Glycans expressed by most free-living Bacteria (Eubacteria) and Archaea have relatively little in common with those of eukaryotes. They contain a much larger number of monosaccharide types and include many glycans exclusive to such microbes. In contrast, most major glycan classes in animal cells seem to be represented in some related form among other eukaryotes, and sometimes in Archaea.'
 'Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target.']","Plants and animals express similar repertoires of glycans because they share common evolutionary origins and have similar requirements for cell-cell communication, recognition, and signaling. Glycans play crucial roles in various biological processes such as cell adhesion, immune response, development, and host-microbe interactions in both plants and animals.

The basic building blocks of glycans are conserved across different species, and the enzymes responsible for glycan biosynthesis are also evolutionarily conserved. This conservation leads to the expression of similar types of glycans in plants and animals.

Furthermore, plants and animals interact with similar types of pathogens and symbionts in their environment, which may drive the evolution of shared glycan structures for recognition and defense mechanisms.

Overall, the similarities in glycan repertoires between plants and animals reflect their shared evolutionary history and the functional importance of glycans in diverse biological processes.","Plants and animals express very different repetoires of glycans, owing primarily to the preference of each for alpha and beta glycosidic linkages in their general metabolism.",0.09090909090909091,0.9476323531017918,0.7642944812842126,0.09523809523809523,0.9999999999666667,0.0
