Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.1 Ajit Varki and Stuart Kornfeld. This chapter provides a historical background to the field of glycobiology and an overview of this book. General terms found in the volume are considered, common monosaccharide units of glycoconjugates mentioned, and a uniform symbol nomenclature used for structural depictions presented. The major glycan classes discussed in the book are described, and an overview of the general pathways for their biosynthesis is provided. Topological issues relevant to biosynthesis and functions of glycoconjugates are also considered, and the growing role of these molecules in medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioenergy, and materials science is mentioned. Defined in the broadest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (also called carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature and of the proteins that recognize them. How does glycobiology fit into the modern concepts of molecular biology? The central paradigm driving research in molecular biology has been that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The power of this concept lies in its template-based precision, the ability to manipulate one class of molecules based on knowledge of another, and the patterns of sequence homology and relatedness that predict function and reveal evolutionary relationships. With ongoing sequencing of numerous genomes, spectacular gains in understanding the biology of nucleic acids and proteins have occurred. Thus, many scientists assume that studying just these molecules will explain the makeup of cells, tissues, organs, physiological systems, and intact organisms. In fact, making a cell requires many small molecule metabolites as well as two other major classes of macromolecules—lipids and carbohydrates—which serve as intermediates in generating energy and as signaling effectors, recognition markers, and structural components. Taken together with the fact that they encompass some of the major posttranslational modifications of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates help explain how the relatively small number of genes in the typical genome can generate the enormous biological complexities inherent in the development, growth, and functioning of diverse organisms. The biological roles of carbohydrates are particularly prominent in the assembly of complex multicellular organs and organisms, which requires interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix. However, without any known exception, all cells and numerous macromolecules in nature carry an array of covalently attached sugars (monosaccharides) or sugar chains (oligosaccharides), which are generically referred to in this book as “glycans.” Sometimes glycans can also be freestanding entities. Being on the outer surface of cellular and secreted macromolecules, many glycans are in a position to modulate or mediate a variety of events in cell–cell, cell–matrix, and cell–molecule interactions critical to the development and function of a complex multicellular organism. They can also mediate interactions between organisms (e.g., between host and a parasite, pathogen, or a symbiont). In addition, simple, rapidly turning over, protein-bound glycans are abundant within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in which they can serve as regulatory switches. A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids). In analogy to the current situation in Cosmology, glycans can be considered as the “dark matter” of the biological universe: a major and critical component that has yet to be fully incorporated into the “standard model” of biology. However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities.'
 'However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities. Furthermore, during the molecular biology revolution of the 1970s, studies of glycans lagged far behind those of other major classes of molecules. This was in part because of their inherent structural complexity, the difficulty in determining their sequences, and the fact that their biosynthesis could not be directly predicted from a DNA template. The development of many new technologies for exploring the structures and functions of glycans has since opened a new frontier of molecular biology called “glycobiology”—a word first coined in the late 1980s to recognize the coming together of the traditional disciplines of carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry with a modern understanding of the cell and molecular biology of glycans and, in particular, their conjugates with proteins and lipids. Glycobiology is now one of the more rapidly growing fields in the natural sciences, with broad relevance to many areas of basic research, biomedicine, and biotechnology. The field includes the chemistry of carbohydrates, the enzymology of glycan formation and degradation, the recognition of glycans by specific proteins, roles of glycans in complex biological systems, and their analysis or manipulation by various techniques. Research in glycobiology thus requires a foundation not only in the nomenclature, biosynthesis, structure, chemical synthesis, and functions of glycans, but also in the general disciplines of molecular genetics, protein chemistry, cell biology, developmental biology, physiology, and medicine. This book provides an overview of the field, with relative emphasis on the glycans of animal systems. It is assumed that the reader has a basic background in advanced undergraduate-level chemistry, biochemistry, and cell biology. Some of the major investigators who influenced the early development of Glycobiology are shown in Figure 1.1, and more are listed in Online Appendix 1A. Many others have made major contributions as well, and a summary of the general principles gained from all this research is presented in Table 1.1. Nobel laureates in fields related to the history of glycobiology.

General principles of glycobiology  Carbohydrates are defined as polyhydroxyaldehydes, polyhydroxyketones and their simple derivatives, or larger compounds that can be hydrolyzed into such units. A monosaccharide is a carbohydrate that usually cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler form. It has a potential carbonyl group at the end of the carbon chain (an aldehyde group) or at an inner carbon (a ketone group). These two types of monosaccharides are therefore named aldoses and ketoses, respectively (for examples, see below, and for more details, see Chapter 2). Free monosaccharides can exist in open-chain or ring forms (Figure 1.2). Ring forms of the monosaccharides are the general rule in oligosaccharides, which are linear or branched chains of monosaccharides attached to one another via glycosidic linkages (the term “polysaccharide” is typically used for large glycans composed of repeating oligosaccharide motifs; for examples, see Chapter 3). The ring form of a monosaccharide generates a chiral anomeric center at C-1 for aldo sugars or at C-2 for keto sugars (for details, see Chapter 2). A glycosidic linkage involves the attachment of a monosaccharide to another residue, typically via the hydroxyl group of this anomeric center, generating α-linkages or β-linkages that are defined based on the relationship of the glycosidic oxygen to the anomeric carbon and ring (Chapter 2).'

Karlsson, Kay-Hooi Khoo, Morten Thaysen-Andersen, Lance Wells, and Nicolle H. Packer. The term genomics arose from the availability of complete genome sequence data as well as computational methods for their analysis. However, <2% of genes in the human genome encode proteins. These genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that make up the “transcriptome,” of which ∼30% are assigned to protein coding. The total complement of proteins expressed by the cell is collectively termed the “proteome.” Most eukaryotic proteins are post translationally modified (e.g., by phosphorylation, sulfation, oxidation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, lipidation, or glycosylation). These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher. The systems-level analysis of all proteins expressed by cells, tissues, or organisms is known as “proteomics.” The proteome, like the transcriptome, but unlike the DNA sequence of the genome, is fundamentally dynamic. The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle. As cells receive external and internal cues in the form of growth factors, hormones, metabolites, or cell–cell interactions, the expression of various genes is modulated and may be transcribed at levels ranging from silence to more than 104 mRNA copies per cell and 107 protein molecules per cell. Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation. However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome. Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27). The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward. The notion that glycans should be studied as a totality (glycomics), as well as simply one glycan or glycoconjugate at a time, developed when it became apparent that glycans form patterns on cells that change during development (Chapter 41), cancer progression (Chapter 47), infection (Chapters 42 and 43), and many other diseases (Chapters 44–46). Many glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins, are oligomerized on the cell surface and interact with multivalent arrays of glycans on the same or opposing cells (Chapters 28–38). Sometimes, multiple discrete glycans and their matching glycan-binding proteins work together to engage two cells or to deliver signals between cells.'
 'What Are the Complete Structures of All the Glycans within the Human Glycome or Any Animal or Plant Glycome?  Every day witnesses new glycan structures being identified, with previously unknown and novel sugar linkages, along with unique and unanticipated modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphodiesters, and sulfation. How many such glycan structures exist within a glycome, to what glycoproteins or lipids are they attached, and where are they attached? Much of our knowledge of the human glycome comes from studying serum glycoproteins and several cell lines, but there is little information about the overall complexity of the human glycome either at the glycan level or the glycoprotein level.  What Is the True Extent of Diversity of Glycans, Glycan-Binding Proteins, and Glycan-Degrading Enzymes in the Microbiome?  It is clear that investigators are just beginning to scratch the surface of the organismal diversity within the complex diverse microbiomes that occupy various niches in nature. Each time a new species within a given microbiome is sequenced, the genomes are found to predict hundreds of “carbohydrate-active” enzymes. Understanding the mechanisms and functions of all these molecules is a major challenge for the future, as is the deciphering of the structures of the complex glycans they generate, bind, or degrade.  Do More Complex Biological Systems Have Simpler Glycosylation?  Of the hundreds of known monosaccharides in nature, less than a dozen are found in vertebrates, and many more tend to be found in simpler, earlier evolved systems. Is this an ascertainment bias or does increasing biological complexity place limits on the fraction of the genome that can be committed to controlling glycosylation?  What Is the Significance of Lineage-Specific Gains and Losses of Specific Glycans during Evolution?  Current data indicate that glycans are the most rapidly diverging components of life-forms, with distinct gains and losses that sometimes become (or stay) polymorphic in various lineages and clades. It seems likely that this is a consequence of the intimate involvement of glycans in the most rapidly evolving aspects of biological systems (i.e., host–pathogen interactions, immunity, and reproduction). Further studies are needed to ascertain if glycans are indeed involved in the process of speciation.  When Will the Integration of Glyosciences into the Mainstream of Bioinformatics Be Achieved?  Currently, searches of the main genome and protein databases used by essentially all biologists yield almost no information on the glycosylation state of glycoproteins. Indeed, there is as yet no central comprehensive database of glycan structures that an investigator can mine to determine the occurrence, provenance, or phylogeny of a specific glycan of interest. An international effort led by nearly every major country involved in the glycosciences has come together to agree on uniform standards for describing glycans in computer databases and to develop methods to curate and maintain glycan structural data. Together with the expanding use of uniform symbol nomenclature (Chapter 1), this is the first step toward integrating glycomic data into mainstream protein databases (Chapter 52).  When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?  As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems. When that intellectual singularity is eventually achieved, further editions of this book may no longer be necessary.'
 ""Because of their inherent flexibility, oligosaccharides typically exist in solution or on proteins, as an ensemble of conformations, making it a challenge to describe their 3D structure (see Chapters 30 and 50 for a description of 3D structures). Computational chemistry is an essential tool in analyzing glycan experimental data, to make predictions that may be tested experimentally, and to unravel and explain chemical processes at the atomic level. Web-based tools are available to generate a theoretical model of a carbohydrate 3D structure. A useful resource is GLYCAM-Web that provides tools for modeling oligosaccharides and glycoproteins in addition to providing downloadable structure files that can be used for molecular modeling. SWEET-II is also a carbohydrate 3D builder that is available on the GLYCOSCIENCES.de website. The two major databases for storing experimentally determined 3D carbohydrate structures are the PDB and the Cambridge Structural Database. Crystal structures of oligosaccharides are also available at Glyco3D. A recent extension of the latter is GAG-DB, centered on the 3D description of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Most of the carbohydrates in the PDB are either connected covalently to a glycoprotein or form a complex with a lectin, enzyme, or antibody. Recently, the PDB has undergone a carbohydrate remediation, ensuring that carbohydrates are accurately annotated. Therefore PDB entries now contain glycan annotations, which are available in LINUCS, GLYCAM (IUPAC-like), and WURCS formats. Despite the known sequon (NXT/S, X is not Pro) for N-linked glycosylation, many potential sites are not glycosylated in vivo, and there are no clear motif(s) for predicting O-linked glycosylation. Understanding the “rules'' of attachment site specificity for the glycosylation of proteins is thus an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. Over the past 20 years, neural networks, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been implemented to predict N- or O-glycosylation and C-mannosylation. Although the original tools were hosted on the Danish CBS Prediction Servers, additional resources have emerged in the last few years. Glycoprotein informatic resources of GlyGen, GlyCosmos, and Glycomics@Expasy now provide information on the glycan structures as attached to proteins in a complementary manner. The coverage and content depend on both automated and manual efforts to mine or curate current literature that contains characterized glycan structures and their sites of attachment to proteins and on supporting data from experimental conditions and biological sources. This collaborative, international bioinformatic integration of complex molecular data from all types of glycoanalytical techniques and interactions is in constant development and is essential for the continued progress of glycobiological research. Systems biology involves the development, simulation, and analysis of biological systems (including whole-body and environmental systems) at the molecular and cellular levels. As research on glycan biosynthetic pathway simulation progresses, its integration with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics data represents the next step. This will result in a holistic understanding of biological processes (Figure 52.1), such that glycomics data can be viewed in the context of complementary data. Such integrated knowledge will result in better elucidation of the glycosylation process, reveal new interactions with GBPs, and enhance our understanding of related functional consequences. The current coordinated trend toward RDF-based data integration is already shaping future developments of glycoscience databases. It will help bridge the gap between glycomics and other -omics that have already adopted RDF ontologies but that are still very much DNA sequence–centered. Indeed, 50 years after the advent of sequencing technology, DNA sequences, along with their links to other data types (gene expression, protein structure, etc.), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates.""]","A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids).

"Complete the following paragraph: Monosaccharide names are frequently abbreviated; most common are three-letter abbreviations for simple monosaccharides (e.g., Gal, Glc, Man, Xyl, Fuc). There are nine common monosaccharides found in vertebrate glycoconjugates (Figure 2.4). Once incorporated into a glycan, these nine monosaccharide building blocks can be further modified to generate additional sugar structures.","['As mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, all monosaccharides consist of a chain of chiral hydroxymethylene units, which terminates at one end with a hydroxymethyl group and at the other with either an aldehyde group (aldoses) or an α-hydroxy ketone group (ketoses). Glyceraldehyde is the simplest aldose and dihydroxyacetone is the simplest ketose (Figure 2.1). The structures of glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone are distinct in that glyceraldehyde contains an asymmetric (chiral) carbon atom (Figure 2.1), whereas dihydroxyacetone does not. With the exception of dihydroxyacetone, all monosaccharides have at least one asymmetric carbon atom, the total number being equal to the number of internal (CHOH) groups (n–2 for aldoses and n–3 for ketoses with n carbon atoms). The number of stereoisomers corresponds to 2k, where k equals the number of asymmetric carbon atoms. For example, an aldohexose with the general formula C6H12O6 and four asymmetric carbon atoms (i.e., four (CHOH) groups) can be described in 16 possible isomeric forms (Figure 2.1). Structures of glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone. (A) Fischer projection. (B) D- and L-glyceraldehyde. The chiral central carbon in glyceraldehyde gives rise to two possible configurations of the molecule, termed D and L.  The numbering of carbon atoms follows the rules of organic chemistry nomenclature. The aldehyde carbon is referred to as C-1 and the carbonyl group in ketoses is referred to as C-2. The overall configuration (D or L) of each sugar is determined by the absolute configuration of the stereogenic center furthest from the carbonyl group (i.e., with the highest numbered asymmetric carbon atom; this is C-5 in hexoses and C-4 in pentoses). The configuration of a monosaccharide is most easily determined by representing the structure in a Fischer projection. If the OH (or other non-H group) is on the right in the Fischer projection, the overall configuration is D. If the OH (or other non-H group) is on the left, the overall configuration is L (Figure 2.2). This figure also shows D- and L-glucose in the cyclic form (chair conformation) found in solution. Most vertebrate monosaccharides have the D configuration with the exception of fucose and iduronic acid (IdoA) L sugars. The Fischer projections shown in Figure 2.3 illustrate the acyclic structures of all D-aldoses through the aldohexose group. D- and L-glucopyranose in Fischer projection and chair conformation.  Fischer projections for the acyclic forms of the D series of aldoses, ranging from triose to hexose.  Any two sugars that differ only in the configuration around a single chiral carbon atom are called epimers. For example, D-mannose is the C-2 epimer of D-glucose, whereas D-galactose is the C-4 epimer of D-glucose (Figure 2.4). Monosaccharide names are frequently abbreviated; most common are three-letter abbreviations for simple monosaccharides (e.g., Gal, Glc, Man, Xyl, Fuc). There are nine common monosaccharides found in vertebrate glycoconjugates (Figure 2.4). Once incorporated into a glycan, these nine monosaccharide building blocks can be further modified to generate additional sugar structures. For example, glucuronic acid (GlcA) can be epimerized at C-5 to generate IdoA. Many more monosaccharides exist in glycoconjugates from other species and as intermediates in metabolism. We use a symbolic notation for the monosaccharides that are most abundant in vertebrate glycoconjugates (see Chapter 1). Common monosaccharides found in vertebrates. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common form of sialic acid.  Monosaccharides exist in solution as an equilibrium mixture of acyclic and cyclic forms.'

These (more...) Nucleotides and proteins are linear polymers that can each contain only one basic type of linkage between monomers. In contrast, each monosaccharide can theoretically generate either an α- or a β-linkage to any one of several positions on another monosaccharide in a chain or to another type of molecule. Thus, whereas three different nucleotides or amino acids can only generate six trimers, three different hexoses could theoretically produce (depending on which of their forms are considered) anywhere from 1056 to 27,648 unique trisaccharides. This difference in complexity becomes even greater as the number of monosaccharide units found in natural glycan increases (now numbering in the hundreds). Fortunately for the student of glycobiology, naturally occurring biological macromolecules in a given species tend to contain relatively few of the possible monosaccharide units, and they are in a limited number of combinations. Of course, the great majority of glycans in most species have yet to be discovered and structurally defined. Thus, much of the possible diversity may yet exist in nature. Although several hundred distinct monosaccharides are known in nature, only a minority of these are commonly found in well-studied glycans. Examples of common monosaccharides in vertebrate cells are listed below, along with their standard abbreviations (for details regarding their structures, see Chapter 2, and embedded links from the symbols in Online Appendix 1B). Pentoses: five-carbon neutral sugars—D-xylose (Xyl)Hexoses: six-carbon neutral sugars—for example, D-glucose (Glc)Hexosamines: hexoses with an amino group at the 2-position, which can be either free or, more commonly, N-acetylated—for example, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)6-Deoxyhexoses: for example, L-fucose (Fuc)Uronic acids: hexoses with a carboxylate at the 6-position—for example, D-glucuronic acid (GlcA)Nonulosonic acids: family of nine-carbon acidic sugars, of which the most common in animals is the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, also sometimes called NeuAc or, historically, NANA) (see Chapter 15) For simplicity, the symbols D- and L- are omitted from the full names of common monosaccharides from here on unless a less common variant occurs. This limited set of monosaccharides dominates the glycobiology of more recently evolved (so-called “higher”) animals, but several others have been found in “lower” animals (e.g., tyvelose [Chapters 25 and 26], bacteria and Archaea [e.g., keto-deoxyoctulosonic acid, rhamnose, L-arabinose, and muramic acid; Chapters 21 and 22], and plants [e.g., arabinose, apiose, and galacturonic acid; Chapter 24]). A variety of modifications of glycans further enhance their diversity in nature and often serve to mediate specific biological functions. Thus, the hydroxyl groups of different monosaccharides can be subject to modifications such as phosphorylation, sulfation, methylation, O-acetylation, or fatty acylation. Although amino groups are commonly N-acetylated, they can be N-sulfated or remain unsubstituted. Carboxyl groups are occasionally subject to lactonization to nearby hydroxyl groups or even lactamization to nearby amino groups. Details regarding the structural depiction of monosaccharides, linkages, and oligosaccharides are discussed in Chapter 2. Many figures in this volume use a symbolic depiction of sugar chains (see Online Appendix 1B and examples in Figure 1.5). This Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) is expanded from the Second Edition and has been vetted and adopted by many investigators.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.2 Peter H. Seeberger. This chapter covers the basic building blocks of glycans and fundamental considerations regarding glycan structure by introducing chemical concepts. Modes of linking glycans and structural depiction of the same are discussed to provide the groundwork for understanding longer glycans (Chapter 3). In this book, as well as in the earlier editions, the term glycan is used. Still, a host of names are commonly used to refer to sugar polymers in other textbooks and the literature. In the 19th century, sugar-based substances were referred to as carbohydrates, or “hydrates of carbon,” that are based on the general formula C x(H2O)n that also possess a carbonyl group, either an aldehyde or a ketone. Monosaccharides are the simplest of these polyhydroxylated carbonyl compounds (saccharide is derived from the Greek word for sugar or sweetness). Monosaccharides are joined together to give rise to oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Typically, the term “oligosaccharide” refers to any glycan that contains less than 20 monosaccharide residues connected by glycosidic linkages. The term “polysaccharide” is typically used to denote any linear or branched polymer consisting of monosaccharide residues, such as cellulose (Chapters 14 and 24). Thus, the relationship of monosaccharides to oligosaccharides or polysaccharides is analogous to that of amino acids and proteins or nucleotides and nucleic acids (polynucleotides). The term “glycoconjugate” is often used to describe a macromolecule that contains monosaccharides covalently linked to proteins or lipids. The prefix “glyco” and the suffixes “saccharide” and “glycan” indicate the presence of carbohydrate constituents (e.g., glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans). Just as is observed with proteins in nature, additional structural diversity can be imparted to glycans by modifying their hydroxyl groups with phosphate, sulfate, or acetyl esters, and/or their amino groups with acetyl or sulfate groups. A carbohydrate may be termed “complex” if it contains more than one type of monosaccharide building unit. The glucose-based polymer cellulose is an example of a “simple” carbohydrate, whereas a galactomannan polysaccharide, composed of both galactose and mannose, is an example of a complex carbohydrate. However, even so-called simple glycans, such as cellulose and starch, often have very complex molecular structures in three dimensions. The term complex carbohydrates includes glycoconjugates, whereas the term carbohydrates per se would not. Additional nomenclature issues are covered in this chapter and Chapter 3. A more detailed and comprehensive listing of carbohydrate nomenclature rules has been published (see McNaught 1997 and Varki et al. 2015 in Further Reading at the end of this chapter, and Online Appendix 1B). The classification of monosaccharide structures began in the late 19th century with the pioneering work of Emil Fischer. All simple monosaccharides have the general empirical formula Cx(H2O)n, where n is an integer ranging from 3 to 9. As mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, all monosaccharides consist of a chain of chiral hydroxymethylene units, which terminates at one end with a hydroxymethyl group and at the other with either an aldehyde group (aldoses) or an α-hydroxy ketone group (ketoses). Glyceraldehyde is the simplest aldose and dihydroxyacetone is the simplest ketose (Figure 2.1).'
 'Two isomeric disaccharides.  The relationship of the glycosidic bond to oligosaccharides is analogous to the relationship of the amide bond to polypeptides and the phosphodiester bond to polynucleotides. However, amino acids and nucleotides are linked in only one fashion during the formation of polypeptides and nucleic acids, respectively; there is no stereochemical or regiochemical diversity in these biopolymers. The number of monomeric residues contained in an oligosaccharide is designated in the nomenclature—disaccharide, trisaccharide, and so on. Just as polypeptides have amino and carboxyl termini and polynucleotides have 5′ and 3′ termini, oligosaccharides have a polarity that is defined by their reducing and nonreducing termini (Figure 2.15). The reducing end of the oligosaccharide bears a free anomeric center that is not engaged in a glycosidic bond and thus retains the chemical reactivity of the aldehyde. However, it continues to be referred to as reducing end even when it is engaged in a linkage (e.g., to the hydroxyl of serine or threonine in glycoproteins). Structures are commonly written from the nonreducing end on the left toward the reducing end on the right. For some structures, there is no reducing end. For example, the common disaccharides sucrose and trehalose have glycosidic linkages between the anomeric centers of two monosaccharide constituents (Figure 2.16). Reducing and nonreducing ends of a disaccharide.  Nonreducing disaccharides.  The glycosidic linkage is the most flexible part of a disaccharide structure. Whereas the chair conformation of the constituent monosaccharides is relatively rigid, the torsion angles around the glycosidic bond (φ, ψ, and ω; Figure 2.17) can vary. Thus, a disaccharide of well-defined primary structure can adopt multiple conformations in solution that differ in the relative orientation of the two monosaccharides. The combination of structural rigidity and flexibility is typical of complex carbohydrates and essential to their biological functions.

Glycans are linked to other biomolecules, such as lipids or amino acids within polypeptides, through glycosidic linkages to form glycoconjugates (see Chapters 9, 10, 11, and 12). Glycans are often referred to as the glycone of a glycoconjugate and the noncarbohydrate component is named the aglycone. The glycan may be a mono- or an oligosaccharide. In conclusion, monosaccharide building blocks can be linked to various regio- and stereochemistries, and the resulting oligosaccharides can be assembled on protein or lipid scaffolds (see Chapter 3).

 'Many more monosaccharides exist in glycoconjugates from other species and as intermediates in metabolism. We use a symbolic notation for the monosaccharides that are most abundant in vertebrate glycoconjugates (see Chapter 1). Common monosaccharides found in vertebrates. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common form of sialic acid.  Monosaccharides exist in solution as an equilibrium mixture of acyclic and cyclic forms. The percentage of each form depends on the sugar structure. The cyclic form of a monosaccharide is characterized by a hemiacetal group formed by the reaction of one of the hydroxyl groups with the C-1 aldehyde or ketone. For reasons of chemical stability, five- and six-membered rings are most commonly formed from acyclic monosaccharides. Hexoses (six-carbon aldoses) and hexuloses (six-carbon ketoses) form six-membered rings via a C-1—O—C-5 ring closure; they form five-membered rings through a C-1—O—C-4 ring closure (Figure 2.5). A five-membered cyclic hemiacetal is labeled a “furanose” and a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called a “pyranose.” Pentoses can form both pyranose and furanose forms. Cyclization of acyclic D-glucose to form pyranose and furanose structures. The cyclization reaction produces both the α and β anomers (i.e., C-1 epimers).  Monosaccharides can also be represented as Haworth projections in which both five- and six-membered cyclic structures are depicted as planar ring systems, with the hydroxy groups oriented either above or below the plane of the ring (Figure 2.6). Although not truly representative of the three-dimensional structure of a monosaccharide, the Haworth representation has been used since the late 1920s as an easy-to-draw formula that permits a quick evaluation of stereochemistry around the monosaccharide ring. The Haworth representations are preferably drawn with the ring oxygen atom at the top (for furanose) or the top right-hand corner (for pyranose) of the structure; the numbering of the ring carbons increases in a clockwise direction. Conversion from Fischer to Haworth projection. Each hydroxyl group projected to the right in the Fischer projection points down in the Haworth formula.  For any D sugar, the conversion of a Fischer projection into a Haworth projection proceeds as follows: (1) any groups (atoms) that are directed to the right in the Fischer structure are given a downward orientation in the Haworth structure, (2) any groups (atoms) that are directed to the left in the Fischer structure are given an upward orientation in the Haworth structure, and (3) the terminal —CH2OH group is given an upward orientation in the Haworth structure. For an L sugar, (1) and (2) are the same, but the terminal —CH2OH group is projected downward. The planar Haworth structures are distorted representations of the actual molecules. The preferred conformation of a pyranose ring is the “chair” conformation, similar to the structure of cyclohexane. The conversion from Haworth projection to chair conformation leaves the downward or upward orientation of ring substituents unaltered. Two chair conformations can be distinguished and designated as 4C1 and 1C4, respectively (Figure 2.7A), and these conformers can interconvert by a process called the “ring flip.” The first numeral in the chair conformer designation (superscript) indicates the number of the ring carbon atom above the “seat of the chair (C)” and the second numeral (subscript) indicates the number of the ring carbon atom below the plane of the seat (spanned by C-2, C-3, C-5, and the ring O). Chair conformations are designated from structures with the ring oxygen atom in the top right-hand corner of the ring “seat,” resulting in the clockwise appearance of the ring numbering.']","Once incorporated into a glycan, these nine monosaccharide building blocks can be further modified to generate additional sugar structures. Common monosaccharides found in vertebrates include Gal (galactose), Glc (glucose), Man (mannose), Xyl (xylose), Fuc (fucose), GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine), Neu5Ac (N-acetylneuraminic acid), GlcA (glucuronic acid), and Neu5Gc (N-glycolylneuraminic acid).","For example, glucuronic acid (GlcA) can be epimerized at C-5 to generate IdoA.

"Complete the following paragraph: In solution, NMR studies show IdoA2S and IdoA residues to be present in a mixture of 1C4 and 2S0 conformations. The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins.","['A common method involves affinity fractionation of proteins on Sepharose columns containing covalently linked GAG chains, usually heparin. The bound proteins are eluted with different concentrations of sodium chloride, and the concentration required for elution is generally proportional to the Kd. High-affinity interactions require 0.5–2 m NaCl to displace bound ligand, which usually translates into Kd values of 10−7–10−9 m (determined under physiological salt concentrations by equilibrium binding). Proteins with lower affinity (10−5–10−7 m) often require only 0.2–0.5 m NaCl to elute. This method assumes that GAG–protein interactions are entirely ionic, which is not entirely correct. Nevertheless, it can provide an assessment of relative affinity, when comparing different GAG-binding proteins. A number of more sophisticated methods are now in use that provide detailed thermodynamic data (ΔH [change in enthalpy], ΔS [change in entropy], ΔCp [change in molar heat capacity], etc.), kinetic data (association and dissociation rates), and high-resolution data on atomic contacts in GAG–protein interactions (Table 38.2). Regardless of the technique one uses, it must be kept in mind that in vitro binding measurements are not likely to be the same as those when the protein binds to proteoglycans on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix, where the density and variety of GAG-binding proteins, proteoglycans, and other interacting factors varies greatly. To determine the physiological relevance of the interaction, one should consider measuring binding under conditions that can lead to a biological response. For example, one can measure binding to cells with altered GAG composition (Chapter 49) or after treatment with specific lyases to remove GAG chains from the cell surface (Chapter 17) and then determine whether the same response occurs as observed in the presence of GAG chains. The interaction can then be studied more intensively using the in vitro assays described above. Methods to measure glycosaminoglycan (GAG)–protein interaction  As mentioned above, most GAG-binding proteins interact with HS and/or heparin. The likely basis for this preference is greater sequence heterogeneity and more extensive and variable sulfation compared with other GAGs. The unusual conformational flexibility of iduronic acid, which is found in heparin, HS, and DS, also has a role in their ability to bind proteins. GAGs are linear helical structures, consisting of alternating residues of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) with glucuronic acid (GlcA) or IdoA (with the exception of KS, which consists of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and galactose residues; Chapter 17). Inspection of heparin oligosaccharides containing highly modified domains ([GlcNS6S-IdoA2S]n) shows that the N-sulfo and 2-O-sulfo groups of each disaccharide repeat lie on opposite sides of the helix from the 6-O-sulfo and carboxyl groups (Figure 38.1). Analysis of the conformation of individual sugars shows that N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid residues assume a preferred conformation in solution, designated 4C1 (indicating that carbon 4 is above the plane defined by carbons 2, 3, and 5 and the ring oxygen, and that carbon 1 is below the plane; Chapter 2). In contrast, IdoA2S assumes the 1C4 or the 2S0 conformation (Figure 38.1), which reorients the position of the sulfo substituents, thereby creating a different orientation of charged groups. In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding. IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind.'
 'Structural diversity of these polymers is primarily a result of additional sulfation of hydroxyl groups and is discussed below for the diverse HS polymers found in mammals. GAGs found in other animals can be distinct from mammalian GAGs by virtue of further modifications. For example, marine invertebrates can carry particularly unique sulfation patterns (i.e., 3-O-sulfation on GlcA residues) and distinct side-chain modifications (i.e., fucosylation on chondroitin sulfate). Structures of (A) disaccharide repeating units of different glycosaminoglycans and (B) the conformations of monosaccharides from heparan sulfate.  GAGs show biological function primarily through their interactions with the hundreds of GAG-binding proteins found on cellular surfaces and in extracellular spaces. The structural factors that affect the strength and specificity of binding are key to the elicitation of a proper biological response. HS, the most studied member of the GAG family, provides a good illustration of the wide range of physiological and pathophysiological functions affected. HS, for example, is involved in trimolecular interactions with growth factors and growth factor receptors, and thereby participates in regulating embryonic development. HS interacts with proteases and protease inhibitors in the blood to control the coagulation process and binds to viral envelope proteins as a receptor for viral infections. Also, heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS, is a commonly used anticoagulant drug in the clinic. A more complete discussion of the biological function of HS can be found in Chapters 17 and Chapter 38. This section uses the interaction between HS and proteins to illustrate how structural factors affect binding between GAGs and proteins in general. One factor that contributes to the structural diversity of HS-protein interactions is the conformational flexibility of L-IdoA and its derivative, L-IdoA2S (2-O-sulfo iduronic acid). Present in the pyranose form, the six-membered ring structure of IdoA or IdoA2S can adopt either chair or skew-boat conformations (Figure 3.3B). Until now, only the 4C1 chair conformation has been verified experimentally for GlcA and GlcN in HS, but both the 1C4 chair and the 2S0 conformations have been found for IdoA2S residues in crystal structures containing HS. In solution, NMR studies show IdoA2S and IdoA residues to be present in a mixture of 1C4 and 2S0 conformations. The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins. Structural elements that dictate preferences for one form over the other, including the possible effects from the sulfated monosaccharide sequences around the IdoA/IdoA2S residue, are subject to further investigation. A second factor contributing to structural diversity and selective interactions with certain HS-binding proteins is the size of the sulfated saccharide domains. HS isolated from natural sources shows domain-like structures, with clusters of six to eight saccharides forming the highly sulfated domains known as S-domains. These regions are separated by nonsulfated saccharide residues, consisting of GlcA-GlcNAc RUs, known as NAc-domains. The S-domains contain primarily IdoA residues that likely contribute the flexibility needed to optimize binding to proteins and elicit desired biological activities. The contribution of NAc-domains to the functions of HS has not been fully established. However, a possible role may be to appropriately position S-domains in a single polysaccharide chain for interaction with multiple proteins. One example is the interaction of heparin with antithrombin and thrombin. In this complex, one part of the heparin chain interacts with antithrombin, and another part of the heparin chain interacts with thrombin. Between the antithrombin-binding domain and thrombin-binding domain, a linker of six to seven saccharide residues exists. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, the biosynthesis of GAGs is not regulated by a well-defined template. Instead, each member of the GAG family is synthesized by a unique pathway (Chapter 17).'
 'In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding. IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind. Thus, the greater degree of conformational flexibility in these modified regions may explain why so many more proteins bind with high affinity to heparin, HS, and DS than to other GAGs. The presence of an N-acetyl group in an N-acetylglucosamine residue changes the preferred conformation of the neighboring IdoA residue, showing that even minor modifications can influence conformation and chain flexibility. Binding to GAGs that have a low degree of sulfation may require larger domains in the protein to interact with longer stretches of an oligosaccharide. Molecular dynamic simulations on large heparin oligosaccharides, even in the presence of proteins, are possible with recent advances in computer performance (Online Appendix 38A). Such simulations can be used to predict the conformational flexibility of different domains within the chain and, when combined with recent advances in protein–GAG docking, can provide additional insights into GAG–protein interactions. Conformation of heparin oligosaccharides. (A) Glucosamine (GlcN) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) exist in the 4C1 conformation, whereas iduronic acid (IdoA) exists in equally energetic conformations designated 1C4 and 2S0. (B) Space-filling model of a heparin (more...) The discovery of multiple GAG-binding proteins led a number of investigators to examine whether there is a consensus amino acid sequence for GAG binding. In retrospect, this strategy was overly simplistic because it assumed that all GAG-binding proteins have a common evolutionary origin and would recognize the same oligosaccharide sequence within heparin or, at least, sequences that would share many common features. It is now known that the convergently evolved GAG-binding proteins interact with different oligosaccharide sequences. The binding sites in the protein always contain basic amino acids (lysine and arginine), whose positive charges presumably interact with the negatively charged sulfates and carboxylates of the GAG chains. However, the arrangement of these basic amino acids can be quite variable, consistent with the variable positioning of sulfo groups in the GAG partner. Selectivity is also a function of H-bonding and van der Waal interactions of amino acid residues with the oligosaccharide. Most proteins are formed from α-helices, β-strands, and loops. Therefore, to engage a linear GAG chain electrostatically, the positively charged amino acid residues must align along the same side of the protein segment. α-Helices have periodicities of 3.4 residues per turn, which would require the basic residues to occur every third or fourth position along the helix to align with an oligosaccharide. In β-strands, the amino acid side chains alternate sides every other residue. Thus, to bind a GAG chain, the positively charged residues in a β-strand would be located quite differently than in an α-helix. On the basis of the structure of several heparin-binding proteins that were available in 1991, Alan Cardin and Herschel Weintraub proposed that typical heparin-binding sites had the sequence XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX, where B is lysine or arginine and X is any other amino acid. From the structural arguments provided above, it should be obvious that only some of the basic residues in these sequences could participate in GAG binding, the actual number being determined by whether the peptide sequence exists as an α-helix or a β-sheet. It is now known that the presence of these sequences in a protein merely suggests a possible interaction with heparin (or another GAG chain), but it does not prove that the interaction occurs under physiological conditions. In fact, the predicted binding sites for heparin in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) turned out to be incorrect once the crystal structure was determined.'
 'Figure 38.3D shows a model of a tetramer built on the known dimer structure (PDB id, 1U4L) and complexed with CS hexamers 4-O-sulfated on all three N-acetylgalactosamine residues of the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc repeats. Individual dimers are shown as green and sea green ribbons. Additional dimers can be added to each end to build a filament structure. The interactions between protein residues and charged groups on the CS involve a classic BBXB motif (R44, K45, N46, R47) plus a more remote arginine (R17). Each positively charged arginine is positioned to have strong electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the negatively charged carboxylate of a glucuronic acid residue and 4-O-sulfo group of the following N-acetylgalactosamine residue. The positioning of these arginine residues may be unique to CS, and other GAG segments may bind quite differently. The model of the filament in Figure 38.3D is also not unique, and both positioning of dimeric subunits and flexibility in CS binding geometry may allow longer GAG chains to cross-link adjacent dimers and facilitate oligomerization. A final point of note is that the groups responsible for interaction with the CCR5 receptor on leukocytes are near the amino terminus, a segment deeply buried in the dimer interface. These groups may be transiently exposed on filament dissociation to release monomers or they may be more permanently exposed on filament ends. Much additional structural work will be required to fully understand the function of CCL5. In some cases, the interaction of GAG chains with proteins may depend on metal cofactors. For example, L- and P-selectins have been shown to bind to a subfraction of HS chains and heparin in a divalent-cation-dependent manner. This observation raises the possibility that other examples of cation-dependent interactions with GAG chains may exist. Indeed, annexin A2 and annexin V have been shown to bind HS in a calcium-dependent manner. The co-crystal structures of annexin A2 and annexin V with heparin oligosaccharides revealed that calcium ions can either directly or indirectly (through sequestered water) participate in the interactions with HS. Another example is calcium-dependent interaction between cytokine S100A12 and HS. In this case, formation of the functional HS-binding site requires a calcium-induced conformational change of S100A12. Although the vast majority of GAG–protein interactions were identified and studied under neutral pH, quite a few GAG-binding proteins have been shown to interact with GAG only under acidic pH. Such proteins include histidine-rich glycoproteins, cystatin-C, selenoprotein P, and serum amyloid A. There is good reason to believe that the interactions between these proteins and GAG are physiologically relevant because extracellular environments with acidic pH exist under many physiological and pathological conditions. In fact, for these proteins, pH change essentially functions as an on/off switch of their interactions with GAG, which might bear physiological significances. Not surprisingly, histidines are often found in the GAG-binding site of these proteins because of its pH-dependent protonation of the imidazole ring. A main technical challenge to understand GAG–protein interactions is to dissect the essential structural elements of GAGs that contribute to the binding. Unlike researchers studying DNA-binding proteins who have access to all possible DNA sequences, researchers studying GAG-binding proteins traditionally do not have access to GAG oligosaccharides with defined structures. Fortunately, this situation has begun to change in the last 5 years. With the rapid progress of chemoenzymatic and chemical synthesis (or a combination of both) of HS/CS oligosaccharides, a growing number of structural defined oligosaccharides (dp4-dp20) have become available. Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins.'
 'In some cases, there may be relatively little information on where the binding site on a protein is, so the characterization involves locating the best binding site, finding the best conformation for the ligand in the bound state, and finding the best conformations for the parts of the protein involved in binding. The whole process is referred to as “docking” a ligand onto a protein surface. Most docking programs (e.g., AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and Glide) are designed to make the initial search for a site very efficient. To do this, they break the process into stages beginning with a rigid-body docking step that is designed to identify the best docking site and best initial “poses” for the ligand. Force fields are often simplified or interaction energies precalculated on a grid to speed up the process. Rigid-body docking generally works well for many small drug-like molecules. Also, in many situations, there is a crystal structure of the protein with a native ligand in the binding site, mitigating the problem of finding the binding pocket and optimizing side-chain conformations. For glycans, the situation is more complicated; the ligands are often flexible and protein structures with a native glycan in a binding site are often lacking. In molecular docking, the objective is not to generate a single bound structure in the first stage but hundreds of “poses” that can be scored and ranked so that a subset can be selected for subsequent stages. Scoring functions are variable but usually include some sort of interaction energy as part of the score. Subsequent phases typically allow increased flexibility of side-chains and finally an MD refinement of poses, often in explicit water. Final scoring or ranking of poses by energy, even when performed with force fields used in MD programs, seldom leads to a single clear solution, and it has become common to filter poses with additional experimental information such as binding epitopes from STD NMR experiments or interactions with residues that have been identified as important in mutational studies. Some docking programs are emerging (e.g., HADDOCK) that make use of experimental data in earlier stages to guide the selection of initial poses as well as maintain known preferences for glycan conformations or specific ligand–protein contacts. Some of the contributions to understanding of glycan–protein interactions that have come from docking exercises, as well as more advanced applications that merge QM with MD, are described in more detail in the following sections. Heparan sulfate (HS) chains, synthesized initially as a repeating disaccharide of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and modified subsequently by sulfation and epimerization of some GlcA residues to iduronic acid (IdoA), are known to interact with a number of growth factors, receptors, and chemokines (Chapters 17 and 38). Despite the interest in the roles of these interactions in cell migration and differentiation, there are relatively few experimental structures depicting interactions with large HS fragments. The fact that suitable crystals are less apt to form in the presence of HS oligomers contributes to the lack of structures of complexes. Also, it is difficult to obtain homogeneous preparations of large oligomers, because of the variable sulfation patterns and variable conversion of GlcA to IdoA. Computational modeling offers an alternative route to structures for many of these complexes. Specific patterns of sulfation and IdoA substitution are generated with ease. Yet, there are some challenges related to the flexibility of the HS chains and the ionic character of interactions that dominate their energetics; glycosidic angles in HS chains are variable, and IdoA rings sample several conformations, including a chair, 1C4, and a skew-boat conformer, 2S0. Moreover, orientations of the sulfate groups are variable, as are the side-chains of the lysine and arginine residues with which they tend to interact. Enhanced docking methodology combined with MD simulations overcomes some of these challenges. Leukocyte common antigen-related protein (LAR) is a type IIa receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) important for signal transduction in biological processes, including axon growth and regeneration. Glycosaminoglycan chains, including HS, act as ligands that regulate LAR signal transduction.']",This conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins.,"Structural elements that dictate preferences for one form over the other, including the possible effects from the sulfated monosaccharide sequences around the IdoA/IdoA2S residue, are subject to further investigation.

This chapter provides an overview of glycosylation from the perspective of a single cell, taking into account the patterns of expression, topology, and other features of the biosynthetic and degradative enzymes that are common to most cell types. The focus is mostly on the organization of glycosylation in eukaryotic cells. Chapters 21 and 22 further address prokaryotic glycosylation mechanisms. After more than three billion years of evolution, every free-living cell and every cell type within eukaryotic organisms remains covered with a dense and complex layer of glycans (Chapter 20). Even enveloped viruses that bud from infected cells carry with them the glycosylation patterns of the host. Additionally, most secreted molecules are glycosylated and extracellular matrices of multicellular organisms are rich in glycans and glycoconjugates. Matrices secreted by unicellular organisms when they congregate (e.g., bacterial biofilms [Chapter 21]) also contain glycans. Thus, evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu. Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms. They then make their way via an intermediate compartment (IC) through multiple stacks of the Golgi apparatus, finally being distributed to various destinations from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Secretory pathway proteins can be N-glycosylated, O-glycosylated, and/or modified with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, and some called proteoglycans are modified with attached glycosaminoglycan chains. The enzymes involved in each of these modification pathways are distinct. N-linked glycans and GPI anchors are preassembled before being transferred to proteins and then further modified in the ER–Golgi pathway. The stepwise assembly of O-linked glycans and glycosaminoglycans, as well as the glycosylation of lipids, involve reactions in both the ER and Golgi (Chapters 9–13 and 17). Figure 4.1 superficially depicts some steps in the synthesis of the major glycan classes in the ER–Golgi pathway of animal cells.

This chapter provides an overview of glycosylation patterns across biological taxa and discusses glycan complexity and diversity from an evolutionary perspective. As much of the currently available information concerns vertebrates, this chapter emphasizes comparisons between vertebrate glycans and those of other taxa. Evolutionary processes that likely determine generation of glycan diversity are briefly considered, including intrinsic host glycan-binding protein functions and interactions of hosts with extrinsic pathogens or symbionts. The genetic code is shared by all known organisms, and core functions such as gene transcription and energy generation are conserved across taxa. Complex glycans are found in all organisms in nature, and some have argued that polysaccharides were the original macromolecules contributing to the origin of life itself. Regardless of their origins, they vary immensely in structure and expression (abundance and patterns of distribution in and on cells, secretions, and extracellular matrices) both within and between evolutionary lineages. Partly because of inherent difficulties in elucidating their structures, our knowledge about this diversity remains limited, and there are few comprehensive data sets. For many taxa, there is a lack of any information on glycan profiles. Sufficient data are available to indicate that even though all living cells require a glycocalyx (a dense and complex array of cell-surface glycans), there is no evidence for a universal “glycan code,” akin to the genetic code. Importantly, glycan structures are not directly encoded in the genome. They are synthesized and modified by a network of enzymes in a template-independent manner, and glycophenotypes represent the outcome of co-expressed gene networks and nutrients. Glycans expressed by most free-living Bacteria (Eubacteria) and Archaea have relatively little in common with those of eukaryotes. They contain a much larger number of monosaccharide types and include many glycans exclusive to such microbes. In contrast, most major glycan classes in animal cells seem to be represented in some related form among other eukaryotes, and sometimes in Archaea. Figure 20.1 shows a circular depiction of the phylogeny of cellular life on earth. The rich glycan diversity encountered in the best-studied vertebrate species suggests similar diversity in other groups of organisms, and existing information points to complicated patterns. On the one hand, glycan patterns can form “trends” and characterize entire phylogenetic lineages, wherein one encounters further biochemical variation with subsets unique to certain sublineages. Conversely, many glycans show discontinuous distribution across phyla and distantly related organisms can produce surprisingly similar glycans, using either shared, ancient pathways or convergently (independently) evolved mechanisms.

However, biologists have genomic sequences for only ∼5% of them; as more sequences become available, (more...) The broadest base of evolutionary information concerns asparagine–N-linked glycans, a “general” glycosylation system found in all domains of life (Chapter 9). In prokaryotes, protein N-glycosylation takes place in the periplasm at the plasma membrane, whereas in eukaryotes, covalent attachment of an oligosaccharide takes place intracellularly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, with the protein-bound glycan being further processed in the ER and Golgi.'
 'The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions. The binding proteins in turn fall into two broad groups: lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins (Chapters 27, 28, and 38). Such molecules can be either intrinsic to the organism that synthesized the cognate glycans (e.g., see Chapters 31–36, 38, and 39) or extrinsic (see Chapters 37 and 42 for information concerning microbial proteins that bind to specific glycans on host cells). The atomic details of these glycan–protein interactions have been elucidated in many instances (Chapters 29 and 30). Although there are exceptions to this notion, the following general theme has emerged regarding lectins: monovalent binding tends to be of relatively low affinity, and such systems typically achieve their specificity and function by achieving high avidity, via interactions of multivalent arrays of glycans with cognate lectin-binding sites. Whenever a new tool (e.g., an antibody or lectin) specific for detecting a particular glycan is developed and used to probe its expression in intact organisms, it is common to find exquisitely specific temporal and spatial patterns of expression of that glycan in relation to cellular activation, embryonic development, organogenesis, and differentiation (see Chapter 41 for examples). Certain relatively specific changes in expression of glycans are also often found in the course of transformation and progression to malignancy (Chapter 47), as well as other pathological situations such as inflammation (Chapter 46). These spatially and temporally controlled patterns of glycan expression imply the involvement of glycans in many normal and pathological processes, the precise mechanisms of which are understood in only some cases. Remarkably little is still known about the evolution of glycosylation. There are clearly shared and unique features of glycosylation in different kingdoms and taxa. Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target. The specialized glycans expressed by parasites and microbes that are of great interest from the biomedical point of view (Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 43) may themselves be subject to evolutionary selection pressures. These issues are further considered in Chapter 20, which also discusses the limited information concerning how various glycan biosynthetic pathways appear to have evolved and diverged in different life-forms. Numerous natural bioactive molecules are glycoconjugates, and the attached glycans can have dramatic effects on the biosynthesis, stability, action, and turnover of these molecules in intact organisms. For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology. Patenting a glycoprotein drug, obtaining FDA approval for its use, and monitoring its production all require knowledge of the structure of its glycans.'
 'Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution. Viruses typically have minimalist genomes and use host-cell machinery for replication. Thus, glycosylation of enveloped viruses reflects that of the host. However, there are exceptions. Giant viruses such as the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough that they can express their own glycosylation machineries. On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors. For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide. In this regard, it has been suggested that the high frequency of heterozygous states for human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 44) may reflect selection for genomes that limit glycosylation of invading viruses. Host lectins may also be “hijacked” by glycans on viral surface glycoproteins. For example, Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1; Chapter 15) is used by the heavily sialylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to gain entry into macrophages. Viral protein sequence can also influence host glycosylation (e.g., by structural constraints on access for glycosyltransferases or hydrolases), in a manner that favors viral antigenicity, such as the high-mannose N-glycans on HIV-1 envelope gp120 trimers. Despite the enormous potential for structural diversity, a rather limited subset of all possible monosaccharides and their possible linkages and modifications are found in eukaryotic cells. Why one encounters only such a limited subset of the possible glycan structures is a puzzling question. Could there be trade-offs between the variety of glycan structures and the additional resources, such as energy and biosynthetic pathways, that cells/organisms need in order to maintain that variety? Or maybe the variety of structures is limited by a combination of positive and negative selection due to both, its intrinsic functions and interactions with symbionts and pathogens? Regardless, this limited subset has allowed better elucidation of structures of eukaryotic glycans. In contrast, Bacteria and Archaea have had several billion additional years to respond to selective pressure from pathogens; in particular, phages. These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow. Glycosylation in Bacteria and Archaea is far more diverse, both in terms of the range of monosaccharides used or synthesized, and in the types of linkages and modifications (Chapters 21 and 22). In addition, prokaryotic cell–cell interactions both within and between species are often mediated by glycans. However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity.'
 'Last but not least, innate immune mechanisms are kept in check in vivo via recognition of self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs). Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses. Perhaps not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved this state of molecular mimicry by making use of “every possible trick in the book,” including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer. In some instances, the impact of the pathogen is aggravated by autoimmune reactions, resulting from host reactions to these self-like antigens. Pathogens and parasites also engage in glycogimmickry—to cite just a few examples, the gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis induces tolerogenic states of gut immunity using a pentasaccharide called polysaccharide A, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) binding to host dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbingcnonintegrin (DC-SIGN) induces expression of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10, and helminthic parasites have evolved many ways to modulate the immune response of their hosts toward prolonged tolerance, using specific immunomodulatory glycans. Secreted and soluble milk oligosaccharides (all extensions of the disaccharide lactose) of mammals provide an example of trans-generational glycan manipulation of microbial symbionts or pathogens in the infant by maternal glycans. These glycans have potent effects by favoring symbionts and blocking pathogenic microbes (bacteria and viruses) of the infant gut. Expression of certain glycans on different glycoconjugates in different tissues at different stages of development implies diverse roles for these glycan structures within the same organism. For example, Man-6-P-containing glycans were first found on lysosomal enzymes and are involved in lysosomal trafficking (Chapter 33). However, such glycans are now known to occur on some apparently unrelated proteins, for different functional roles. Likewise, the sialylated fucosylated lactosamines critical for selectin recognition (Chapter 34) are found in a variety of unrelated cell types in mammals, and the polySia chains that play an important part in embryonic nervous system neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) function (Chapter 15) are also found on a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) (CCR7) expressed in dendritic cells, where they appear to be important for targeting of these cells to the lymph nodes. Given that glycans are added posttranslationally, these observations should not be surprising. Once a new glycan or modification has been expressed in an organism, several distinct functions could evolve independently in different tissues and at different times in development. If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species. Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20).']","Evolution has consistently favored glycans as the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu. This is evident in the dense and complex layer of glycans covering every free-living cell and cell type within eukaryotic organisms, the glycosylation patterns carried by enveloped viruses from infected cells, the glycosylation of most secreted molecules, and the presence of glycans and glycoconjugates in extracellular matrices of multicellular organisms and matrices secreted by unicellular organisms like bacterial biofilms.","Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function.",1.0,0.6660570466725865,0.7515235673916615,0.03731343283582089,0.99999999998,1.0

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.5 Hudson H. Freeze, Michael Boyce, Natasha E. Zachara, Gerald W. Hart, and Ronald L. Schnaar. In nature, most glycans are synthesized by glycosyltransferases, enzymes that transfer activated forms of monosaccharides from nucleotide sugars and lipid-linked sugar intermediates to acceptors, including proteins, lipids, and growing glycan chains. Monosaccharide precursors are imported into the cell, salvaged from degraded glycans, or created enzymatically from other sugars within the cell. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation occurs mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, whereas monosaccharide activation and interconversions occur mostly in the cytoplasm. Nucleotide sugar–specific transporters carry activated sugar donors into the Golgi and to a lesser extent into the ER. In some cases, nucleotide sugars are used to synthesize activated lipid-linked intermediates before glycan transfer. This chapter describes how cells accomplish these tasks, with an emphasis on animal cells. Glucose and fructose are the major carbon and energy sources for organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Most organisms can synthesize the other monosaccharides needed for glycan biosynthesis from these sources. Not all of these biosynthetic pathways are equally active in all types of cells. However, there are some general principles. Monosaccharides must be activated to a high-energy donor for use in glycan synthesis. This process requires nucleoside triphosphates (typically UTP or GTP) and a glycosyl-1-P (monosaccharide with a phosphate at the anomeric carbon). They can be activated by a kinase (reaction 1) or generated from a previously synthesized activated nucleotide sugar (reactions 2 and 3):    The most common nucleotide sugar donors in animal cells are shown in Table 5.1. Sialic acids and their evolutionary ancestors (prokaryotic nonulosonic acids and Kdo) are the only monosaccharides in animals activated as CMP-mononucleotides. Iduronic acid does not have a nucleotide sugar parent because it is formed by epimerization of glucuronic acid after it is incorporated into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In some instances, one nucleotide sugar can be formed from another either by direct epimerization (reaction 2 above) or by a nucleotide exchange reaction (reaction 3 above). For example, UDP-Gal is made from UDP-Glc by exchange of Gal-1-P for Glc-1-P. Activated sugar donors in animal cells  Three types of sugar transporters carry sugars across the plasma membrane into cells. First are energy-independent facilitated diffusion transporters, such as the glucose transporter (GLUT) family of hexose transporters found in yeast and most mammalian cells. The genes encoding these proteins are named SLC2A (solute carriers 2A). Second are energy-dependent transporters—for example, the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT; gene names SLC5A) in intestinal and kidney epithelial cells. The third type includes transporters that couple ATP-dependent phosphorylation with sugar import. These are found in bacteria (Chapter 21) and are not covered in this chapter. GLUT family transporters were first described in yeast, where at least 18 genes are known. Humans have 14 GLUT homologs. GLUT transporters range in size from ∼40 to 70 kDa and have a similar structure, containing 12 membrane-spanning domains, which is typical of many eukaryotic transporters. The transmembrane domains form a barrel with a small pore for sugar passage. Compared with GLUT1, the other family members have a modest (28%–65%) amino acid identity.'
 'Figure 4.1 superficially depicts some steps in the synthesis of the major glycan classes in the ER–Golgi pathway of animal cells. Initiation and maturation of the major types of eukaryotic glycoconjugates in relation to subcellular trafficking in the ER–Golgi–plasma membrane pathway. This illustration outlines the different mechanisms and topology for initiation, (more...) In the ER–Golgi pathway, some glycan chains are made on the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes and flipped across to the other side, but most are added to the growing chain on the inside of the ER or the Golgi (Figure 4.1). Regardless, the portion of a molecule that faces the inside of the lumen of the ER or Golgi will ultimately face the outside of the cell or the inside of a secretory granule or lysosome. To date, there are no well-documented exceptions to this topological rule. Of course, these topological considerations are reversed for nuclear and cytoplasmic glycosylation (see below), because the active sites of the relevant glycosyltransferases for these reactions face the cytoplasm. Not surprisingly then, the types of glycans found on the two sides of the cell membrane so far appear to be distinct from each other. Some “leaderless secretory proteins” destined for the extracellular space never enter the ER lumen, but are instead transferred directly through the plasma membrane, by as yet poorly defined mechanisms, including cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and galectins. Interestingly, many of these proteins have glycan binding properties, which would presumably cause problems if they instead traversed the glycan rich ER–Golgi pathway. Regardless of location, most glycosylation reactions use activated forms of monosaccharides (often nucleotide sugars and in some cases lipid-phosphate-linked sugars, such as dolichol phosphate mannose) as donors for glycosyltransferases (see Chapter 5 for a listing of some enzymes, their donors and corresponding transporters, and details about their biochemistry). A variety of glycan modifications also occur in nature (Chapter 6). Of these, the most common are generated by sulfotransferases, acetyltransferases, and methyltransferases, which use activated forms of sulfate (3′-phosphoadenyl-5′-phosphosulfate; PAPS), acetate (acetyl-CoA), and methyl groups (S-adenosylmethionine; AdoMet), respectively. Almost all donors for glycosylation reactions and glycan modifications are synthesized within the cytosolic compartment, from precursors of endogenous origin. In eukaryotes, most of these donors are actively transported across a membrane bilayer by specific multipass transporter proteins, becoming available for reactions within the lumen of the ER–Golgi pathway. For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments. Indeed, one of them (O-linked GlcNAc; Chapter 19) may well be quantitatively the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cells. Both the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) responsible for synthesizing O-linked GlcNAc on nuclear and cytosolic proteins and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) that removes this monosaccharide are soluble proteins in these compartments. In addition, select cytosolic proteins can be modified with O-Glc, O-Fuc, or O-Man (Chapters 18 and 19). Because prokaryotic cells do not have an ER–Golgi pathway, they typically generate their cell-surface glycans at the interface of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm or in the periplasm (see below). Other glycoconjugates like hyaluronan in vertebrate cells, chitin in invertebrate cells, and cellulose in plant cells are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and simultaneously extruded across the membrane to the outside (Chapters 16, 24, and 26).'
 'This transport mechanism was determined biochemically in isolated vesicles and genetically in various mutant cell lines. The Km of the transporters ranges from 1 to 10 µm. Using in vitro systems, the transporters have been shown to increase the concentration of the nucleotide sugars within the Golgi lumen by 10- to 50-fold. This is usually sufficient to reach or exceed the calculated Km of glycosyltransferases that use these donors. Some known transporters for nucleotide sugars, PAPS (3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate), and ATP are located in the Golgi membranes of mammals, yeast, protozoa, and plants. These proteins are antiporters and return the corresponding (more...) Most of these antiporters are found in the Golgi, but some are also found in the ER. They are organelle-specific and their location usually corresponds to the location of the relevant glycosyltransferases (Table 5.2; Figure 5.4). Nucleotide sugar import into the Golgi is not energy-dependent nor affected by ionophores. However, the import is competitively inhibited by the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and diphosphates in the cytosol but not by the monosaccharides. There are also transporters for ATP and PAPS (3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate), which are used for carbohydrate and protein sulfation. Nucleotide transport in Golgi and ER  The glucuronidation of bile and xenobiotic compounds in the ER explains the need for UDP-GlcA transporter in the ER of liver cells. The presence of a Golgi transporter is consistent with the location of the glycosyltransferases that use UDP-GlcA for the formation of GAG chains and other classes of glycans. The observation that reglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins occurs in the ER (Chapter 39) explains the need for an ER UDP-Glc transporter. Under stressful conditions, synthesis of lumenal uridine diphosphatase increases to accommodate increased transport of UDP-Glc needed for reglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins. The existence of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-Xyl transporters in the ER may mean that some reactions thought to occur exclusively in the Golgi may also occur in the ER. A good example is the synthesis of O-fucosylated proteins, such as Notch, in the ER versus fucosylation of N- and O-linked chains in the Golgi (Chapter 13). Other, as-yet-undiscovered, glycosylation reactions may also occur in the ER. Mutations in several nucleotide sugar transporters, UDP-Gal, CMP-Sia, GDP-Fuc, UDP-GlcA/UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-GlcNAc cause human glycosylation disorders (Chapter 45), generating incomplete sugar chains. Mutant mammalian cell lines also lack specific nucleotide sugar transporters (e.g., for UDP-Gal or CMP-Sia; Chapter 49). However, there is some “leakiness” in such mutants. For instance, loss of the UDP-Gal transporter in the Golgi of mutant MDCK (Madin–Darby canine kidney) cells decreases the synthesis of keratan sulfate and galactosylated glycoproteins and glycolipids, but leaves heparan and chondroitin sulfate unaffected. This is probably because the galactosyltransferases that synthesize the core region tetrasaccharide common to GAG chains have lower Km values for their donors (Chapter 17). Many putative transporters were identified by homology in the genomes of mammals, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, plants, and yeast. Like the plasma membrane GLUT transporters discussed above, all are multimembrane-spanning (type III) proteins, but the level of amino acid identity does not give any clue to the substrate specificity. The UDP-GlcNAc transporters from mammalian cells and yeast are 22% identical, whereas mammalian CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GlcNAc transporters have 40%–50% identity.'
 'Because prokaryotic cells do not have an ER–Golgi pathway, they typically generate their cell-surface glycans at the interface of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm or in the periplasm (see below). Other glycoconjugates like hyaluronan in vertebrate cells, chitin in invertebrate cells, and cellulose in plant cells are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and simultaneously extruded across the membrane to the outside (Chapters 16, 24, and 26). The enzymes involved in the synthesis of these glycoconjugates appear to mediate this extrusion. Typical eukaryotic Golgi glycosylation enzymes have also been found at the cell surface or as soluble forms in the extracellular space, as described below. Whether these glycosyltransferases would routinely have adequate supplies of nucleotide sugar donors to modify cell-surface glycans is unclear, but at least one example has been documented (see below). On the other hand, there are examples of remodeling of cell-surface glycans in animal cells—for example, the endosulfatases (Sulf enzymes) that modify heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Chapter 17) and endogenous sialidases that remove cell-surface sialic acids (Chapter 15). Some protozoan parasites, such as trypanosomes, transfer sialic acids from host glycoconjugates to their cell-surface glycans using trans-sialidases (Chapter 43). Prokaryotic assembly pathways of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are very similar to pathways found in the ER and the plasma membrane of eukaryotes. They are assembled in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the plasma membrane. For many biosynthetic pathways, such as O-antigen biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, N-linked protein glycosylation in Archaea, and some Gram-negative bacteria or S-layer biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria, oligosaccharides are assembled on lipid carriers at the inner site of the plasma membrane and then flipped to the periplasmic site (Chapters 21 and 22). Synthesis of oligosaccharides can continue in the periplasm, but for these reactions, isoprenoid-linked monosaccharides serve as activated substrates as is the case in cell wall biogenesis of actinobacteria (mycobacteria) (Chapter 21). Much effort has gone into understanding the mechanisms of glycosylation and glycan modification within the ER and the Golgi apparatus, and it is clear that a variety of interacting and competing factors determine the final outcome of the reactions. The glycosyltransferases and processing glycosidases are well-studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. Despite lack of sequence homology among different glycosyltransferase families, most Golgi enzymes share some features. Early studies of vertebrate glycosyltransferases found some of these activities in soluble form in secretions and body fluids; others were identified as membrane-bound activities within cells, and some showed both properties. Subsequent molecular cloning defined the sequences of Golgi glycosyltransferases, revealing that they share a common topology and domain structure that can account for these observations. The majority of Golgi glycosylation enzymes are type II membrane proteins consisting of three parts: an amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, followed by a transmembrane (TM) region that also acts as an uncleavable signal sequence, and a large carboxy-terminal region containing a membrane-proximal, proteolytically sensitive stem region as well as a large catalytic domain. The type II topology of these Golgi enzymes places their catalytic sequences in the Golgi lumen, where they participate in the synthesis of the glycan chains on proteins and lipids during their transit through the secretory pathway (Figure 4.2). Topology and localization of Golgi glycosylation enzymes. Golgi glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are type II membrane proteins with their catalytic sequences facing the lumen of the Golgi.'
 'In contrast, bacterial and plant polysaccharides and glycoproteins frequently contain a variety of deoxysugars, deoxyaminosugars, and branched-chain sugars. These diverse sugars often have potent biological properties. For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics like streptomycin bind to the bacterial ribosome to disrupt protein synthesis. Deoxyhexoses are often immunological determinants of lipopolysaccharides or O-antigens of the Salmonella species. Five of the eight possible 3,6-dideoxyhexoses have been found in these organisms at the nonreducing end of the Gram-negative cell wall lipopolysaccharide. Other deoxyhexoses, such as a 4,6-dideoxy-hexose and a 2,3,6-trideoxyhexose, are also biologically significant but so far seem to be uncommon in nature. Biosynthesis of both deoxysugars and dideoxysugars begins with the oxidation of C-4, similar to the first step of the conversion of GDP-Man to GDP-Fuc. The nucleotide (N) differs for the various sugars, and the individual pathways use different dehydratases. For example, biosynthesis of most 3,6-dideoxyhexoses (except colitose) begins with conversion of CDP-glucose to CDP-4-keto-6-deoxyhexose by NAD+-dependent CDP-glucose dehydratase. In the biosynthesis of abequose (3,6-dideoxy-D-xylohexose), the product, CDP-6-deoxy-L-threo-D-glycero-hexulose, is then converted in two additional steps to CDP-3,6-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-glycero-4-hexulose by a second dehydratase followed by a reductase. Amino sugars, such as glucosamine, arise from keto sugars by the addition of an amino group from glutamine (Figure 5.1). In addition, bacteria and plants have many 6-deoxy-hexoses with amino groups in the 2, 3, or 4 positions. For example, daunosamine is a 3-amino-6-deoxyhexose that is found in the antibiotic daunomycin. Here, TDP-glucose is dehydrated to 3-keto-6-deoxyglucose and the amino group is added via a transamination reaction, probably involving a vitamin B6-dependent reaction. Plants and bacteria also contain a number of branched-chain sugars. For instance, apiose is a component of the polysaccharide apiogalacturonan of L. minor, and strepose is a component of the antibiotic streptomycin, produced by Streptomyces griseus. Apiose (Figure 5.2) is synthesized from UDP-GlcA via a 4-keto intermediate that can yield UDP-Xyl or UDP-apiose. Apiose synthesis removes carbon 3 from the chain to give the branched sugar by an unknown mechanism. Although the syntheses of other branched-chain sugars have not been delineated, they probably follow similar reaction pathways. In eukaryotes, nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm or nucleus, whereas most glycosylation occurs inside the ER or Golgi compartments (exceptions being hyaluronan [Chapter 16] and nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation [Chapters 18 and 19]). Therefore, newly synthesized nucleotide sugars are on the “wrong” side of the membrane for most glycosylation reactions and so must be transported into the ER and Golgi. Negative charge prevents these donors from simply diffusing into these compartments. To overcome this hurdle, eukaryotic cells have a set of energy-independent nucleotide sugar antiporters that deliver nucleotide sugars into the lumen of these organelles, with the simultaneous exiting of nucleoside monophosphates, most of which must first be generated from the nucleoside diphosphates by a nucleoside diphosphatase (Figure 5.4). This transport mechanism was determined biochemically in isolated vesicles and genetically in various mutant cell lines. The Km of the transporters ranges from 1 to 10 µm.']","The chapter describes how cells accomplish glycosylation tasks, emphasizing animal cells.

Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. In addition, there are a number of transferases that modify glycans by the addition of acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups. This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept.'
 'Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water. Although not necessarily relevant for the product formation in nature (sugar hemiacetals being prone to mutarotation at physiological pH), the different mechanisms employed by “retaining glycosidases” (involvement of a covalent intermediate) and “inverting glycosidases” (no covalent intermediate involved) bears consequences for their use in glycan synthesis. The use of Leloir-type glycosyltransferases in glycan synthesis requires access to the natural donor glycosides, which are sugar nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic advantage of glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis (excellent regio- and stereoselectivity) can be offset by the limitation on the access to the required donor glycosides. However, this challenge may be overcome by in situ biosynthesis/regeneration of the consumed sugar nucleotides. The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst. The resulting trisaccharide 3 is further extended with GDP-fucose 4 as the donor and recombinant fucosyltransferase (FucT) as the catalyst to deliver allyl sialyl-Lewis x. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x. (CMP) Cytidine monophosphate, (CDP) cytidine diphosphate, (CTP) cytidine triphosphate.  In the first step of the assembly line, the expensive sugar nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, is consumed, and on transfer of the sialic acid, cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is produced. With the aid of two consecutive kinases (nucleoside monophosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase), CMP can be transformed in situ into the corresponding triphosphate (CTP), which is then condensed by the enzyme CMP-sialic acid synthetase with sialic acid to regenerate CMP-Neu5Ac 2. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides.  The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans.  The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4).'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17).

Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'
 'Because prokaryotic cells do not have an ER–Golgi pathway, they typically generate their cell-surface glycans at the interface of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm or in the periplasm (see below). Other glycoconjugates like hyaluronan in vertebrate cells, chitin in invertebrate cells, and cellulose in plant cells are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and simultaneously extruded across the membrane to the outside (Chapters 16, 24, and 26). The enzymes involved in the synthesis of these glycoconjugates appear to mediate this extrusion. Typical eukaryotic Golgi glycosylation enzymes have also been found at the cell surface or as soluble forms in the extracellular space, as described below. Whether these glycosyltransferases would routinely have adequate supplies of nucleotide sugar donors to modify cell-surface glycans is unclear, but at least one example has been documented (see below). On the other hand, there are examples of remodeling of cell-surface glycans in animal cells—for example, the endosulfatases (Sulf enzymes) that modify heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Chapter 17) and endogenous sialidases that remove cell-surface sialic acids (Chapter 15). Some protozoan parasites, such as trypanosomes, transfer sialic acids from host glycoconjugates to their cell-surface glycans using trans-sialidases (Chapter 43). Prokaryotic assembly pathways of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are very similar to pathways found in the ER and the plasma membrane of eukaryotes. They are assembled in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the plasma membrane. For many biosynthetic pathways, such as O-antigen biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, N-linked protein glycosylation in Archaea, and some Gram-negative bacteria or S-layer biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria, oligosaccharides are assembled on lipid carriers at the inner site of the plasma membrane and then flipped to the periplasmic site (Chapters 21 and 22). Synthesis of oligosaccharides can continue in the periplasm, but for these reactions, isoprenoid-linked monosaccharides serve as activated substrates as is the case in cell wall biogenesis of actinobacteria (mycobacteria) (Chapter 21). Much effort has gone into understanding the mechanisms of glycosylation and glycan modification within the ER and the Golgi apparatus, and it is clear that a variety of interacting and competing factors determine the final outcome of the reactions. The glycosyltransferases and processing glycosidases are well-studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. Despite lack of sequence homology among different glycosyltransferase families, most Golgi enzymes share some features. Early studies of vertebrate glycosyltransferases found some of these activities in soluble form in secretions and body fluids; others were identified as membrane-bound activities within cells, and some showed both properties. Subsequent molecular cloning defined the sequences of Golgi glycosyltransferases, revealing that they share a common topology and domain structure that can account for these observations. The majority of Golgi glycosylation enzymes are type II membrane proteins consisting of three parts: an amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, followed by a transmembrane (TM) region that also acts as an uncleavable signal sequence, and a large carboxy-terminal region containing a membrane-proximal, proteolytically sensitive stem region as well as a large catalytic domain. The type II topology of these Golgi enzymes places their catalytic sequences in the Golgi lumen, where they participate in the synthesis of the glycan chains on proteins and lipids during their transit through the secretory pathway (Figure 4.2). Topology and localization of Golgi glycosylation enzymes. Golgi glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are type II membrane proteins with their catalytic sequences facing the lumen of the Golgi.'

Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages and glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages. The diversity of natural glycans is reflected by the numerous glycosyltransferases and glycosidases encountered in nature, each exhibiting a defined substrate specificity. Natural glycans are often encountered in heterogeneous form and often produced in minute amounts making their isolation and characterization from natural sources often cumbersome. Therefore, glycobiology relies heavily on synthetic glycans, and synthetic methodology to produce glycans has witnessed tremendous progress (see Chapter 53). Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases offer advantages in the construction of glycans as these biocatalysts are very powerful under controlled conditions. This chapter summarizes recent developments in the use of (mutant) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of tailored glycans, including combinations of both enzyme classes and in conjunction with chemically synthesized intermediates are presented. The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide. Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center. The mechanisms employed by most Leloir glycosyltransferases are now resolved. Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide. (GCS) Glucosylceramide synthase, (UDP) uridine diphosphate glucose, (GBA) acid glucosylceramidase.  Glucosylceramide is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal exo-glucosidase, acid glucosylceramidase (GBA). Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water.']","Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages, while glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.7 Pascal Gagneux, Thierry Hennet, and Ajit Varki. This chapter provides an overview of the biological functions of glycans in three broad categories: structural roles in, on, and outside cells; energy metabolism, including nutrient storage and sequestration; and information carriers, that is, specific recognition—most commonly by glycan-binding proteins of intrinsic or extrinsic origin. The chapter then presents some general principles for understanding and further exploring biological functions of glycans. For details, see the sources cited and other chapters in this book. As with other major classes of macromolecules, the biological functions of glycans span the spectrum from relatively subtle to crucial for development, growth, maintenance, or survival of the organism that synthesizes them. For many glycans, specific functions are not yet evident. The same glycan may also have different functions depending on which aglycone (protein or lipid) it is attached to. Over the years, many theories have been advanced regarding biological roles of glycans. Although there is evidence to support all the theories, exceptions to each one can also be found. This should not be surprising, given the abundance and enormous diversity of glycans in nature. Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them. Biological functions of glycans can be divided into three broad categories: (1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs]) (Figure 7.1). The GBPs can be subdivided into two groups: (1) intrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from the same organism and (2) extrinsic GBPs, which recognize glycans from another organism. Intrinsic GBPs typically mediate cell–cell interactions or recognize extracellular molecules, but they can also recognize glycans on the glycocalyx of same cell. Extrinsic GBPs comprise pathogenic microbial adhesins, agglutinins, or toxins, which evolved for host colonization or invasion, but also include proteins that mediate symbiotic relationships or host defense directed at microbial glycans. Intrinsic and extrinsic glycan recognition can also act as opposing selective forces, simultaneously constraining and driving evolutionary change respectively (Chapter 20), likely accounting for the enormous diversity of glycans in nature. Further diversity arises because microbial pathogens also engage in “molecular mimicry,” evading immune reactions by decorating themselves with glycans typical of their hosts, and even in “glycan gimmickry,” modulating host immunity toward increased tolerance. Finally, most microbes are also themselves targets of pathogens that use microbial glycans for attachment and infection (e.g., bacteriophages that invade bacteria). General classification of the biological functions of glycans. A simplified and broad classification is presented, emphasizing the roles of organism-intrinsic and -extrinsic glycan-binding proteins in recognizing glycans. There is some overlap between (more...) Other general principles emerge based on existing literature. The biological consequences of experimentally altering glycosylation in various systems seem to be highly variable and unpredictable. Also, a given glycan can have different roles in different tissues, at different times in development (organism-intrinsic functions) or in different environmental contexts (organism-extrinsic functions). As a broad generalization, it can be stated that terminal sequences, unusual structures, and modifications of glycans are more likely to mediate specific biological functions within the organism. However, such glycans or their modifications are also more likely to be targets for pathogens and toxins.'
 'The biological consequences of experimentally altering glycosylation in various systems seem to be highly variable and unpredictable. Also, a given glycan can have different roles in different tissues, at different times in development (organism-intrinsic functions) or in different environmental contexts (organism-extrinsic functions). As a broad generalization, it can be stated that terminal sequences, unusual structures, and modifications of glycans are more likely to mediate specific biological functions within the organism. However, such glycans or their modifications are also more likely to be targets for pathogens and toxins. Perhaps as a consequence, intra- and interspecies variations in glycosylation are relatively common, and at least some of the diversity of glycans in nature may represent signatures of past or current host–pathogen or symbiotic interactions (Chapter 20). Finally, genetic defects in glycosylation are easily obtained in cultured cells, but often have limited biological consequences in vitro. In contrast, the same defects often have major and even catastrophic consequences in whole organisms. This generalization indicates that many major functions of glycans are operative mainly within an intact, multicellular organism. Some of these principles are briefly discussed below. Experimental approaches to elucidating biological roles of glycans include prevention of initial glycosylation, prevention of glycan chain elongation, alteration of glycan processing, enzymatic or chemical deglycosylation of completed chains, genetic elimination of glycosylation sites, addition of unnatural monosaccharides, and studies of mutant and naturally occurring genetic variants in glycosylation enzymes. The consequences of such manipulations can range from being essentially undetectable, to the complete loss of particular functions, or even to loss of the entire glycoconjugate bearing the altered glycan. Even within a particular class of molecules (e.g., cell-surface receptors), the effects of altering glycosylation are variable and unpredictable. Moreover, the same glycosylation change can have markedly different effects in different cell types or when studied in vivo or in vitro. The effect may depend on the structure of the glycan, the biological context (including interactions with cognate glycan receptors), GBPs, and the specific biological function. Given all of the above considerations, it is difficult to predict the functions that a given glycan on a given glycoconjugate might mediate and its relative importance to the organism. Glycans have many protective, stabilizing, organizational, and barrier functions. The glycocalyx that covers all eukaryotic cells and the polysaccharide coats of various prokaryotes represent a substantial physical barrier. Cellulose provides the material for cell walls in plants, and chitin fulfills this role in fungi. Arthropods evolved resistant chitin-rich exoskeletons. Cellulose and chitin represent the two most abundant biopolymers on the planet. In multicellular organisms, glycan constituents of matrix molecules, such as proteoglycans, are important for maintenance of tissue structure, porosity, and integrity. Such molecules can also contain binding sites for other specific glycans, which, in turn, aid overall matrix organization. The external location of glycans on most glycoproteins can provide a general shield, protecting the underlying polypeptide from recognition by proteases (mucins), blocking antibody binding (viral glycoproteins), and even (as in the case of mucins) protecting entire tissue surfaces from microbial attachment. Another structural role of glycans is their involvement in folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or in the subsequent maintenance of protein solubility and conformation (Chapter 39). Indeed, when some proteins are incorrectly glycosylated, they can fail to fold properly and/or to exit the ER. Such misfolded glycoproteins are translocated to the cytoplasm for degradation in proteasomes. Conversely, there are examples of glycoproteins whose synthesis, folding, trafficking, sensitivity to proteolysis, or immune recognition seem unaffected by altering their glycosylation. Moreover, inhibitors (Chapter 55) or genetic mutations (Chapter 45) that only affect later steps of glycan processing often do not interfere with basic structural functions. Although structural functions of glycans are obviously of great importance to the intact organism, they do not explain the evolution of such a diverse and complex range of molecules.'
 'Glycomic analysis thus needs to be complemented by classical methods such as tissue-section staining or flow cytometry, using lectins or glycan-specific antibodies that aid in understanding the glycome by taking into account the heterogeneity of glycosylation at the level of the different cell types and subcellular domains in the tissue under study. This is even more important because of the common observation that removing cells from their normal milieu and placing them into tissue culture can result in major changes in the glycosylation machinery of the cell. However, such classical approaches suffer from poor quantitation and relative insensitivity to structural details. A combination of the two approaches is now potentially feasible via laser-capture microdissection of specific cell types directly from tissue sections, with the resulting samples being studied by mass spectrometry. New methods for in situ imaging and characterization of glycans in the intact “forest” are clearly needed. Because most of the genes involved in glycan biosynthetic pathways have been cloned from multiple organisms, it is possible today to obtain an indirect genomic and transcriptomic view of the glycome in a specific cell type (Chapter 8). However, given the relatively poor correlation between mRNA and protein levels, and the complex assembly line and competitive nature of the cellular Golgi glycosylation pathways, even complete knowledge of the mRNA expression patterns of all relevant genes in a given cell cannot allow accurate prediction of the distribution and structures of glycans in that cell type. Thus, there is as yet no reliable indirect route toward elucidating the glycome, other than by actual analysis using an array of methods. Many mutant variants of cultured cell lines with altered glycan structures and specific glycan biosynthetic defects have been described, the most common of which are lectin-resistant (Chapter 49). Indeed, with few exceptions, mutants with specific defects at most steps of the major pathways of glycan biosynthesis have been found in cultured animal cells. The use of such cell lines has been of great value in elucidating the details of glycan biosynthetic pathways. Their existence implies that many types of glycans are not crucial to the optimal growth of single cells growing in the sheltered and relatively unchanging environment of the culture dish. Rather, most glycan structures must be more important in mediating cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions in intact multicellular organisms and/or interactions between organisms. In keeping with this supposition, genetic defects completely eliminating major glycan classes in intact animals all cause embryonic lethality (Chapter 45). As might be expected, naturally occurring viable animal mutants of this type tend to have disease phenotypes of intermediate severity and show complex phenotypes involving multiple systems. Less severe genetic alterations of outer chain components of glycans tend to give viable organisms with more specific phenotypes (Chapter 45). Overall, there is much to be learned by studying the consequences of natural or induced genetic defects in intact multicellular organisms, including humans (Chapter 45). A major theme of this volume is the exploration and elucidation of the biological roles of glycans. It is interesting to note that, in the short time since the first edition, we have gone from asking “what is it that glycans do anyway?” to having to explain a large number of complex and sometimes nonviable glycosylation-modified phenotypes in humans, mice, flies, and other organisms. Like any biological system, the optimal approach carefully considers the relationship of structure and biosynthesis to function (Chapter 7). As might be imagined from their ubiquitous and complex nature, the biological roles of glycans are remarkably varied. Indeed, asking what these roles are is akin to asking the same question about proteins. Thus, all of the proposed theories regarding glycan function turn out to be partly correct, and exceptions to each can also be found. Not surprisingly for such a diverse group of molecules, the biological roles of glycans also span the spectrum from those that are subtle to those that are crucial for the development, growth, function, or survival of an organism (Chapter 7). The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions.'
 'The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions. The binding proteins in turn fall into two broad groups: lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins (Chapters 27, 28, and 38). Such molecules can be either intrinsic to the organism that synthesized the cognate glycans (e.g., see Chapters 31–36, 38, and 39) or extrinsic (see Chapters 37 and 42 for information concerning microbial proteins that bind to specific glycans on host cells). The atomic details of these glycan–protein interactions have been elucidated in many instances (Chapters 29 and 30). Although there are exceptions to this notion, the following general theme has emerged regarding lectins: monovalent binding tends to be of relatively low affinity, and such systems typically achieve their specificity and function by achieving high avidity, via interactions of multivalent arrays of glycans with cognate lectin-binding sites. Whenever a new tool (e.g., an antibody or lectin) specific for detecting a particular glycan is developed and used to probe its expression in intact organisms, it is common to find exquisitely specific temporal and spatial patterns of expression of that glycan in relation to cellular activation, embryonic development, organogenesis, and differentiation (see Chapter 41 for examples). Certain relatively specific changes in expression of glycans are also often found in the course of transformation and progression to malignancy (Chapter 47), as well as other pathological situations such as inflammation (Chapter 46). These spatially and temporally controlled patterns of glycan expression imply the involvement of glycans in many normal and pathological processes, the precise mechanisms of which are understood in only some cases. Remarkably little is still known about the evolution of glycosylation. There are clearly shared and unique features of glycosylation in different kingdoms and taxa. Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target. The specialized glycans expressed by parasites and microbes that are of great interest from the biomedical point of view (Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 43) may themselves be subject to evolutionary selection pressures. These issues are further considered in Chapter 20, which also discusses the limited information concerning how various glycan biosynthetic pathways appear to have evolved and diverged in different life-forms. Numerous natural bioactive molecules are glycoconjugates, and the attached glycans can have dramatic effects on the biosynthesis, stability, action, and turnover of these molecules in intact organisms. For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology. Patenting a glycoprotein drug, obtaining FDA approval for its use, and monitoring its production all require knowledge of the structure of its glycans.'
 'Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species. Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20). Given all of the above, it is challenging to predict which glycan structures are likely to mediate the more specific or crucial biological roles within an organism. As mentioned above, terminal sugar sequences, unusual structures, or modifications of glycans are more likely to be involved in such specific roles. The predictive value of this observation is reduced by the fact that such entities are also more likely to be involved in interactions with microorganisms and other potentially noxious agents. Further complexity arises from “microheterogeneity” in glycan structure (Chapter 20), wherein the same glycosylation site on the same protein in the same species can carry a variety of related glycan structures or none at all. The challenge then is to predict and sort out which distinct roles can be assigned to a given glycan structure in a given cell type and organism. In the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and hosts, pathogens will tend to exploit glycans that are difficult for the host to change (those constrained by their intrinsic host function), and because hosts are unable to alter their glycans easily owing to their slower evolutionary rates and functional constraints of existing glycans, the extrinsic and intrinsic functions of these glycans are bound to overlap. Hosts can, however, to the degree possible, be expected to evolve glycans that are difficult for microbes to mimic, such as the vertebrate-specific sialic acid Neu5Gc (Chapter 15) and sulfated GAGs, prokaryotes do not seem to have reinvented (Chapter 17). Because microorganisms and parasites that bind glycans evolve in parallel with their multicellular hosts, they must adapt their glycan-binding “repertoire” to any change in glycan structure presented by the host. At the same time, each of these microorganisms is itself host to its own suite of parasites (phages), known to exploit the cell surface glycans of microbes in order to infect these. Host populations (multicellular organisms infected by microbes or microbes infected by phages) may evolve new modifications of the structures targeted by their parasites, especially if the latter had meanwhile evolved a vital function elsewhere within the organism. This would constrain the preservation of the underlying scaffolding on which the latest modification was placed, while adding yet another layer of complexity to host glycans. Such cycles of evolutionary interaction between (nested sets of) microbes and hosts might explain some of the complex and extended sugar chains found in multicellular organisms, especially in areas of frequent microbial contact, such as in secreted mucins on mucosal surfaces. In this manner, “junk” glycans (i.e., glycans without current adaptive value) could accumulate, akin to “junk” DNA. An important distinction is that much of the junk DNA consists of selfish DNA elements capable of replicating, whereas glycans cannot encode additional copies of themselves, given that their synthesis relies on the activity of a coordinated network of gene products. Although such structures may still function as structural scaffolding, they may have no other specific role in a particular cell type at that particular time in evolution. They would, of course, provide fodder for future evolutionary selection, either for new organism-intrinsic functions or selective responses to a new pathogen. Additionally, neutral drift (which is now acknowledged as a major process in evolution) may explain some of the apparent “junk” glycans. The microheterogeneity inherent in glycan synthesis processes may be producing “neutral noise,” but this noise may also contribute to evolutionary flexibility. Some functions of glycans are discovered serendipitously. In other instances, the investigator who has elucidated complete details of the structure and biosynthesis of a specific glycan is left without knowing its functions. It is necessary to design experiments that can differentiate between trivial and crucial functions mediated by each glycan. Various approaches are discussed below, emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach (also presented in schematic form in Figure 7.2).']","structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs])","(1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs])",1.0,0.7418977481669007,0.9589698622498567,0.035211267605633804,0.99999999998,1.0

Karlsson, Kay-Hooi Khoo, Morten Thaysen-Andersen, Lance Wells, and Nicolle H. Packer. The term genomics arose from the availability of complete genome sequence data as well as computational methods for their analysis. However, <2% of genes in the human genome encode proteins. These genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that make up the “transcriptome,” of which ∼30% are assigned to protein coding. The total complement of proteins expressed by the cell is collectively termed the “proteome.” Most eukaryotic proteins are post translationally modified (e.g., by phosphorylation, sulfation, oxidation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, lipidation, or glycosylation). These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher. The systems-level analysis of all proteins expressed by cells, tissues, or organisms is known as “proteomics.” The proteome, like the transcriptome, but unlike the DNA sequence of the genome, is fundamentally dynamic. The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle. As cells receive external and internal cues in the form of growth factors, hormones, metabolites, or cell–cell interactions, the expression of various genes is modulated and may be transcribed at levels ranging from silence to more than 104 mRNA copies per cell and 107 protein molecules per cell. Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation. However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome. Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27). The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward. The notion that glycans should be studied as a totality (glycomics), as well as simply one glycan or glycoconjugate at a time, developed when it became apparent that glycans form patterns on cells that change during development (Chapter 41), cancer progression (Chapter 47), infection (Chapters 42 and 43), and many other diseases (Chapters 44–46). Many glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins, are oligomerized on the cell surface and interact with multivalent arrays of glycans on the same or opposing cells (Chapters 28–38). Sometimes, multiple discrete glycans and their matching glycan-binding proteins work together to engage two cells or to deliver signals between cells.'
 ""Many glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins, are oligomerized on the cell surface and interact with multivalent arrays of glycans on the same or opposing cells (Chapters 28–38). Sometimes, multiple discrete glycans and their matching glycan-binding proteins work together to engage two cells or to deliver signals between cells. Thus, the term “glycomics” was coined to describe the many aspects of glycobiology that can be understood only with a systems-level analysis of the glycome. Clues regarding the composition and complexity of the glycome are found in the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of a cell. Thus, if a gene encoding a glycosyltransferase is not expressed (absent from the transcriptome), no glycans in that cell can carry the sugar transferred by that glycosyltransferase at that particular time. The action of many glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases competing for the same substrates in the biosynthetic pathway renders the complete glycome impossible to predict with current tools and knowledge. As an example, the reduced expression of a single glycosyltransferase can perturb the biosynthesis of dozens of glycans. Furthermore, unlike the genome, the glycome is sensitive to exogenous nutrient levels and metabolic fluxes including salvage pathways. Thus, variations in dietary monosaccharides, such as glucose, galactose, glucosamine, fucose, mannose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Chapter 15), may change the composition of the glycome. The numerous factors that influence the glycome (the transcriptome, the proteome, environmental nutrients, the secretory machinery, pH, and many other determinants) create a glycome that is highly diverse, adaptable, and dynamic. Thus, the glycome of a cell can change dramatically over time. It is this enormous structural plasticity in response to cellular and environmental states that underlies the essential roles of glycans in development, communication, and disease processes. Because the glycome is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, the information contained therein sheds light on intra- and interspecies variations, including providing indicators of disease that can be used for diagnosis and for monitoring the efficacy of drugs. Comparative glycomics, the comparison of glycome profiles obtained from two or more individuals, tissues, or conditions of interest, is therefore an exciting frontier in biology and medicine. For example, as discussed in detail in Chapter 47, numerous changes in the glycome have been associated with malignancy and metastasis, including altered N- and O- linked protein glycosylation, up-regulation of conjugated sialylated and fucosylated glycans, and altered GAGs. Regardless of functional consequence, a change in the glycome that is highly correlated with malignancy (or any disease) may serve as a diagnostic marker candidate. Notably, glycans altered in a disease may reflect downstream consequences of the disease on remote organs, changes in the patient's immune system, or other effects of the disease. One major caveat is the currently unknown extent of natural variation among individual human glycomes. The glycome is known to respond to dietary and environmental changes and vary in elusive ways with age, gender, and acquired disease susceptibility (Chapter 46). Studies of evolutionary biology also have much to gain from comparative glycomics. Evolution of the vertebrate immune system, for example, was accompanied by the acquisition of new classes of glycan-binding proteins, including Siglecs (Chapter 35) and selectins (Chapter 34). Likewise, the glycomes and glycan-binding proteins of microbes and their vertebrate hosts appear to have coevolved in some instances (Chapter 42). The glycome can be determined at different levels of granularity. First, “glycomics” constructs an inventory of glycans separated from their protein or lipid scaffolds from the cell, organ, or organism of interest. This is an important starting point for any comprehensive glycome analysis. The second level of analysis defines specific glycans associated with individual proteins or lipids. Analysis of the complete repertoire of a cell's glycoconjugates, including the microheterogeneity of glycans present at individual sites of attachment, lies, for example, at the intersection of glycomics and proteomics (“glycoproteomics”) and of glycomics and lipidomics (“glycolipidomics”).""
 'The final complete degradation of most eukaryotic glycans is generally performed by multiple glycosidases in the lysosome. Once degraded, their individual unit monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytosol for reuse (Figure 1.8). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, the O-GlcNAc monosaccharide modifications of the nucleus and cytoplasm appear more dynamic (Chapter 19). In some instances, extracellular or intracellular free glycans can also serve as signaling molecules (Chapter 40). Biosynthesis, use, and turnover of a common monosaccharide. This schematic shows the biosynthesis, fate, and turnover of galactose, a common monosaccharide constituent of animal glycans. Although small amounts of galactose can be taken up from the outside (more...) Unlike oligonucleotides and proteins, glycans are not commonly found in a linear, unbranched fashion. Even when linear (e.g., GAGs), they often contain a variety of substituents, such as sulfate groups, which are not uniformly distributed. Thus, complete sequencing of glycans is usually impossible by a single method and requires iterative combinations of physical, chemical, and enzymatic approaches that together yield the details of structure (for a discussion of low- and high-resolution separation and analysis, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR], see Chapter 50). Less detailed information on structure may be sufficient to explore the biology of some glycans and can be obtained by simple techniques, such as the use of enzymes (endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases), lectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 48 and 50), chemical modification or cleavage, metabolic radioactive labeling, antibodies, or cloned glycosyltransferases (Chapters 53 and 54). Glycosylation can also be perturbed in various ways, for example, by glycosylation inhibitors and primers (Chapters 55 and 56) and by genetic manipulation of glycosylation in intact cells and organisms (Chapter 49). Directed in vitro synthesis of glycans by chemical and enzymatic methods has also made great strides in recent years, providing many new tools for exploring glycobiology (Chapters 53, 54, and 57). The generation of complex glycan libraries by a variety of routes has further enhanced this interface of chemistry and biology (Chapters 53 and 54), including the generation of glycan microarrays. Analogous to genomics and proteomics, glycomics represents the systematic methodological elucidation of the “glycome” (the totality of glycan structures) of a given cell type or organism (Chapters 51 and 52). In reality, the glycome is far more complex than the genome or proteome. In addition to the vastly greater structural diversity in glycans, one is faced with the complexities of glycosylation microheterogeneity (see above) and the dynamic changes that occur in the course of development, differentiation, metabolic changes, aging, malignancy, inflammation, or infection. Added diversity arises from intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation. Thus, a given cell type in a given species can manifest a large number of possible glycome states. Glycomic analysis today generally consists of extracting entire cell types, organs, or organisms; releasing all the glycan chains from their linkages; and cataloging them via approaches such as mass spectrometry. In a variation called glycoproteomics, the glycans are analyzed while still attached to protease-generated fragments of glycoproteins. The results obtained represent a spectacular improvement over what was possible a few decades ago, but they are still analogous to cutting down all the trees in a forest and cataloging them, without attention to the layout of the forest and the landscape (Chapter 15 discusses this complex issue from the perspective of just one monosaccharide class, sialic acids; see Figure 15.3). Glycomic analysis thus needs to be complemented by classical methods such as tissue-section staining or flow cytometry, using lectins or glycan-specific antibodies that aid in understanding the glycome by taking into account the heterogeneity of glycosylation at the level of the different cell types and subcellular domains in the tissue under study.'
 'Schematic examples of modular glycosyltransferases. GT family modules are shown in red and blue. Other modules in various colors are CBM13, ricin-like carbohydrate-binding module; SH3, src homology domain 3; X84, putative glycan-binding module; PBP, penicillin-binding (more...) Other modular GTs can feature an appended GBP domain. The best-known examples are polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs; GALNT) that transfer N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to Ser or Thr residues (Chapters 6 and 10). In these enzymes, a GT27 catalytic domain is linked to a GBP domain related to ricin and classified as CBM13 in the CAZy database. The GBP domain binds to the GalNAc residue transferred to protein by the GT27 catalytic domain and tethers the enzyme to the substrate. Another example is mouse polypeptide β-xylosyltransferase 2, in which a GT14 catalytic domain is linked to a carboxy-terminal domain that is thought to act as a GBP. The GHs can also be modular, with the catalytic domain appended to one or more other modules whose role is to bind polysaccharides. Although human GHs are infrequently modular, those of microbes involved in plant cell-wall degradation can have more than five different modules assembled in a single polypeptide. Human acidic chitinase is an example of a mammalian modular GH having a CBM14 domain appended at the carboxyl terminus of the GH18 catalytic domain. The most intricate architecture of GHs is found in certain bacteria, such as Clostridium thermocellum, which elaborate a macromolecular complex called a “cellulosome” in which a large variety of modular plant cell-wall hydrolases are assembled together on a scaffolding protein. This strategy enables the assembly of dozens of catalytic modules simultaneously targeting the various polysaccharides that make up the plant cell wall. In summary, the genome, comprising the DNA of an organism, includes all the genes that produce the glycome, which comprises all of the glycans made by an organism. Although, within an organism, almost every cell that contains a nucleus and mitochondria has an identical genome; cells typically differ in the portion of the genome and, therefore the glycome, they express. Thus, the glycan complement of a cell depends on which genes are actively transcribed and which transcripts are translated and stably expressed. Transcription, splicing, translation, and posttranslational processing may vary depending on the state of differentiation and the physiological environment of a cell. Therefore, during development and differentiation, and under different environmental conditions, the glycan repertoire of a cell represents a subset of all the glycans that an organism is capable of making. To describe this variation, it is common to qualify the term glycome when referring to the glycans made by a particular tissue or cell type (e.g., T-cell glycome, hepatocyte glycome, or serum glycome), and to note the particular stage of development (e.g., fetal liver glycome, breast cancer serum glycome). The glycome of a given cell in an organism can undergo substantial changes in response to environmental stimuli ranging from pH and ionic strength to hormonal stimulation or inflammation. Combined with the “assembly-line” nature of the Golgi apparatus (Chapter 4) and potential remodeling by GHs, full knowledge of the GT and GH transcriptome is only a rough predictor of the actual glycome of a given cell type, albeit a very helpful one. Apart from transcriptional control, the glycome is regulated by posttranscriptional control by microRNAs (miRs). For example, GALNT7 is a target of miR-30d, a microRNA that is known to promote melanoma metastasis in patients and mouse models. The down-regulation of GALNT7 phenocopied the expression of miR-30d. Subsequently, miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of the glycome owing to their ability to regulate multiple GT and GH mRNA targets. Nearly 80 GT and GH genes have been identified as targets of miRNAs to date. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Kelley Moremen and Tadashi Suzuki.'
 'Another type of glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (a polymer of GlcNAcβ1-4GlcA), appears to exist primarily as a free glycan unattached to any aglycone (Chapter 16). Some glycosaminoglycans have sulfate esters substituting either amino or hydroxyl groups (i.e., N- or O-sulfate groups). Another anionic polysaccharide that can be extended from LacNAc units is polysialic acid, a homopolymer of sialic acid that is selectively expressed only on a few proteins in vertebrates. Polysialic acids and hyaluronan are also found as the capsular polysaccharides of certain pathogenic bacteria (Chapter 15). For simplicity, this section has focused primarily on vertebrate glycans. Many other classes of glycans exist in other branches of the tree of life (Chapters 21–26). Unlike protein sequences, which are primary gene products, glycan structures are not encoded directly in the genome and are secondary gene products. A few percent of known genes in the human genome are dedicated to producing the enzymes and transporters responsible for the biosynthesis and assembly of glycans (Chapter 8), typically as posttranslational modifications of proteins or by glycosylation of core lipids. The glycans themselves represent numerous combinatorial possibilities, generated by a variety of competing and sequentially acting glycosidases and glycosyltransferases (Chapter 6) and the subcompartmentalized “assembly-line” mechanisms of glycan biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus of eukaryotes (Chapter 4). Thus, even with full knowledge of the expression levels of all relevant gene products, one cannot accurately predict the precise structures of glycans elaborated by a given cell type. Furthermore, small changes in environmental cues can cause dramatic changes in glycans produced by a given cell. It is this variable and dynamic nature of glycosylation that makes it a powerful way to generate and modulate biological diversity and complexity. Of course, it also makes glycans much more difficult to study than nucleic acids and proteins. One of the most fascinating and yet frustrating aspects of protein glycosylation is the phenomenon of microheterogeneity. Thus, at any particular glycan attachment site on a given protein synthesized by a particular cell type, a range of variations might be found in the structures of the attached glycan (and in some instances, the glycan may be missing). Effectively, a given polypeptide encoded by a single gene can exist in numerous “glycoforms,” each constituting a distinct molecular species. For some glycoproteins the microheterogeneity at a particular site may be quite limited, whereas for other sites it may be extensive, even within the same glycoprotein species. Mechanistically, microheterogeneity might be generated by the rapidity with which multiple, sequential, partially competitive glycosylation and deglycosylation reactions take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, through which a newly synthesized glycoprotein passes, along with the lack of a template for directing the synthesis and the accessibility of glycans at a site to the modifying enzymes (Chapter 4). An alternate possibility is that each individual cell or cell type is in fact exquisitely specific in the glycosylation it produces, but that intercellular variations result in the observed microheterogeneity of samples from natural multicellular sources. Whatever the origin of microheterogeneity, it explains the anomalous behavior of glycoproteins in analytical/separation techniques and makes complete structural analysis of a glycoprotein a difficult task. From a functional point of view, the biological significance of microheterogeneity remains unclear. It is possible that this is a type of diversity generator, intended for diversifying endogenous recognition functions and/or for evading microbes and parasites, each of which can bind with high specificity only to certain glycan structures (Chapters 37 and 42). Most well-characterized pathways for the biosynthesis of major classes of eukaryotic glycans are within ER and Golgi compartments (Chapter 4). Newly synthesized proteins originating in the ER are either cotranslationally or posttranslationally modified with glycans at various stages in their itinerary toward their final destinations.']","The glycome comprises all the glycan structures synthesized by an organism. It is analogous to the genome, the transcriptome, and the proteome but even more dynamic, and it has higher structural complexity that has yet to be fully defined. Cells of different types synthesize a subset of the glycome based on their differentiation state and physiological environment.","The human and mouse glycomes have many glycan structures in common, but a few are unique or have divergent functional properties. For example, unlike humans, rodents synthesize cytidine monophospho-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Gc), for the transfer of Neu5Gc to N- and O-glycans (Chapter 15). Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26).",1.0,0.7221502826161805,0.5873307426522445,0.015748031496062992,0.99999999998,0.14285714285714285
"Complete the following paragraph: In mammals, there are two different catalytic STT3 subunits that both associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins (homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively).","['The Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol precursor translocates across the ER membrane bilayer via a “flippase” encoded by the RFT1 locus in yeast. Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol is extended by the addition of four Man and three Glc residues transferred from Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc, respectively. Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc donors are formed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane from GDP-Man and UDP-Glc. Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc must also be flipped across the ER membrane. Mammalian MPDU1 is an ER membrane protein necessary for the utilization of Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc in the ER lumen in the synthesis of the mature N-glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol (Figure 9.3). This 14-sugar glycan is transferred by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) to Asn in receptive Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons in protein regions that have translocated across the ER membrane. OST is a multisubunit protein complex in the ER membrane, except in the case of the kinetoplastids (Chapter 43). OST catalyzes the transfer of the oligosaccharide from Dol-P-P to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in newly synthesized regions of proteins during passage through the translocon into the ER. OST has a high specificity for the completely assembled oligosaccharide, which is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in most eukaryotes. When incomplete oligosaccharides are assembled, transfer efficiency is reduced, resulting in hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins that mature with empty N-glycan sites. All OST subunits are transmembrane proteins with between one and 13 transmembrane domains. The OST complex cleaves the high-energy GlcNAc-P bond, releasing Dol-P-P in the process (Figure 9.3). Yeast OST is comprised of eight different subunits Stt3p, Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost2p, Ost4p, Ost5p, and Ost3p or Ost6p. Stt3p is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The two OST complexes (containing either of the thioredoxin-subunit Ost3p or Ost6p) have a different protein–substrate specificity. The complexity of OST increases in multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are two different catalytic STT3 subunits that both associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins (homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively). The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER. On binding to the catalytic STT3 subunit, the client peptide adopts a 180° turn, making polypeptide folding a competing reaction for N-glycosylation. Indeed, the thioredoxin subunits of the OST complex (Ost3p/Ost6p; MAGT1/TUSC1) modulate the oxidative folding of the client polypeptide, thereby extending the polypeptide substrate range of OST. As of February 2021, the UniProt database reports 1911 N-glycosylation sites in yeast and 13,648 in murine glycoproteins. Following the covalent attachment of the 14-sugar glycan to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in a protein, processing reactions trim the N-glycan in the ER. The initial steps have key roles in regulating glycoprotein folding via interactions with ER chaperones that recognize specific features of the trimmed N-glycan (Chapter 39).'
 'Retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ultimately depends on various protein complexes, some of which contain integral ER membrane proteins. ER membrane proteins with folding defects in the cytosolic domain are extracted from the ER membrane by the Doa10 complex via ERAD-C, whereas those in which the folding defect is present in the luminal (ERAD-L) or membrane (ERAD-M) domains use the Hrd1 complex. Both Doa10p and Hrd1p are integral membrane proteins with E3 ligase activity in their cytosolic portion. Other proteins in these complexes include chaperones, proteins with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity or proteins that recognize misfolded proteins. For instance, glycoproteins with N-glycans containing a terminal α1–6Man are bound by Yos9p and undergo ERAD only if the N-glycans are in unstructured protein, a feature recognized by Hrd3p in the Hrd1 complex. Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the pore by which ERAD-L substrates are actually transported to the cytosol has not been identified, it is known that the substrates must be unfolded in the ER lumen. Although studies on ERAD complexes have been mainly performed in S. cerevisiae, mammalian cells have homologs of nearly all proteins described in the yeast complexes. N-Glycans are removed from unfolded glycoproteins during proteasomal degradation. A cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, N-glycanase, NGLY1) plays an important role in both removing the glycan and constructing an efficient predegradation complex (Figure 39.3). NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins. The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages. First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. A cytoplasmic α-mannosidase cleaves up to four Man residues to generate Man5GlcNAc (Man c, d, e, f, and g in Figure 39.1). This glycan is then taken into the lysosome via an ATP-dependent lysosomal membrane transporter for final degradation to monosaccharides. Whether these free glycans have any function in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment before they are degraded has not been investigated. Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytoplasm, and lysosomes. Specific pathways exist for the degradation of free glycans released from misfolded glycoproteins and glycopeptides generated within the ER. Dolichol-linked (more...) Protein O-fucosyltransferases (Ofut1 in Drosophila; POFUT1 and POFUT2 in mammals) are soluble ER enzymes that O-fucosylate Ser/Thr residues. Ofut1 and POFUT1 add fucose to epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like repeats, whereas POFUT2 adds fucose to thrombospondin (TSR) type 1–like repeats (Chapter 13). EGF and TSR domains are present as tandem repeats in numerous proteins of multicellular organisms. Ofut1/POFUT1 and POFUT2 selectively fucosylate only properly folded protein domains, suggesting a role of this glycosylation in folding quality control. Indeed, several POFUT2 targets including ADAMTSL1 and ADAMTSL2 (scaffolding proteins in the extracellular matrix), ADAMTS9 (a matrix remodeling protease), and ADAMTS13 (the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease) strictly require O-fucosylation for efficient secretion.'
 'Ofut1/POFUT1 and POFUT2 selectively fucosylate only properly folded protein domains, suggesting a role of this glycosylation in folding quality control. Indeed, several POFUT2 targets including ADAMTSL1 and ADAMTSL2 (scaffolding proteins in the extracellular matrix), ADAMTS9 (a matrix remodeling protease), and ADAMTS13 (the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease) strictly require O-fucosylation for efficient secretion. Indeed, O-fucosylation appears to stabilize folded TSRs. The case of Ofut1/POFUT1 is a bit more ambiguous. Studies performed in Drosophila on the efficiency of cell-surface expression of the Ofut1 substrate Notch showed that Ofut1 is required as a chaperone for Notch folding and cell-surface expression, and that chaperone activity is largely independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity. In contrast, POFUT1 does not appear to be absolutely required for cell-surface expression of Notch receptors in all mammalian cells, suggesting that cell-specific chaperones may be able to compensate for loss of POFUT1 in certain contexts. It has been reported recently that O-mannosylation in S. cerevisiae ER might be responsible for terminating futile cycles of association–dissociation between proteins unable to attain their native conformation and Kar2p (the budding yeast homolog of mammalian BiP/Grp78 chaperone). The loss of CNX and CRT in most multicellular organisms causes a severe phenotype. Mice deficient in CNX reach full term, but half die within 2 days of birth, and very few survive beyond 3 months. The runts that survive have obvious motor disorders with loss of large myelinated nerve fibers. CRT-deficient mice and ERp57-null mice also show embryonic lethality. In contrast, CNX and CRT null Caenorhabditis elegans mutants are viable. Yeast has CNX or CNX-like lectins (but not CRT), whereas trypanosomatid protozoa have only CRT. Another important conserved mammalian ER lectin resident is calmegin, expressed only in the testes during spermatogenesis. Calmegin shares ∼60% homology with CNX in mice. Mice deficient in calmegin are nearly sterile despite producing normal-looking sperm. The sperm are defective in migration into the oviducts and they do not adhere to the zona pellucida. UGGT is absent from S. cerevisiae but not from Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. The enzyme is not required for the viability of the fission yeast or single mammalian cells grown under normal conditions. The enzyme is also dispensable for growth of some multicellular organisms, such as plants. However, loss of UGGT is embryonically lethal in mice. This fact, as well of the strict requirement of UGGT for the viability of S. pombe cells only when grown under severe ER stress conditions, point to a restricted set of glycoproteins absolutely requiring UGGT for proper folding. In addition to combined factor V and VIII deficiency caused by ERGIC53 mutations (see above), other congenital diseases result in retention of defective proteins in the ER and their eventual proteasomal degradation. For instance, the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, CFTR-ΔF508, leads to improper folding of this chloride channel and its retention in the ER. Importantly, the mutation affects CFTR transit to the plasma membrane but not its transport activity. Similarly, UGGT recognition of a brassinosteroid receptor mutant triggers retention in the ER of Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Thus, certain diseases caused by ER retention of defective glycoproteins might be ameliorated by inhibitors of UGGT activity. One beautiful example of how the fine sensitivity of UGGT allows modulation of basic physiological processes is its role during antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I). Here, MHC I complexes loaded with suboptimal peptides are recognized by UGGT, thus triggering their retention in the ER. On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface.'
 'Chimera-type R-type lectins connect with various functional domains in invertebrates. Pierisin in cabbage butterfly (Arthropoda, order Lepidoptera) larvae expresses R-type lectin domain at the carboxyl terminus of an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (Uniprot Q9U8Q4) and induces apoptosis of cancer cells. This lectin domain was found to bind to glycan ligands of Gb3 and Gb4 (GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc) glycosphingolipids on cancer cells termed, respectively, Pk and P antigens (Chapter 14). Clotting factor G α-subunit (Uniprot Q27082) in horseshoe crab (Arthropoda, order Crustacea) blood contained two glycoside-hydrolase domains on either side of a central R-type lectin domain. Another R-type lectin, CEL-III (PDB 2Z48), in sea cucumber (Echinodermata, Deuterostomia; Chapter 27) has both a pore-forming domain and a tandem-repeat-type R-type lectin domain and displays hemolytic effect on mammalian erythrocytes. Almost all the configurations seen in invertebrate R-type lectins are also found in bacterial R-type lectins. β-trefoil fold is a very effective protein scaffold for biological functions. Living systems have evidently improved their survival strategies by evolutionary tinkering of the R-type lectin domain per se, or by linking it with other functional domains. UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs: EC 2.4.1.41) have chimeric-form R-type lectin structures consisting of a catalytic subdomain (amino-terminal) and an R-type lectin domain (carboxy-terminal) (PDB 1HXB). Mucin-type O-glycans have a common core structure GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (Figure 31.5), which can be modified by addition of Gal or GalNAc residues (Chapter 10). Most proteins (∼80%) that pass through the secretory apparatus have at least one Ser or Thr residue modified with α-linked GalNAc. A family of ppGalNAcTs functioning in the Golgi are responsible for modification of Ser/Thr residues. Structure and function of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs). (A) ppGalNAcT activity with Ser/Thr-containing acceptor peptide and UDP-GalNAc as donor.

These enzymes are widely distributed in vertebrates, invertebrates, and protists, but so far have not been found in bacteria, plants, or fungi (Chapter 26). In humans, 20 ppGalNAcT-encoding isoform genes have been studied with regard to structure, substrate specificity, and function (Chapter 6). A ppGalNAcT (Uniprot S5S833) was found in a snail that serves as an intermediate host for trematodes, the primary group of schistosomes that infect humans. The snail ppGalNAcT, in contrast to those in vertebrates, has affinity for a wide range of substrates and only one isoform. Enzymes in this family of ppGalNAcTs have multidomain structure and are type II transmembrane proteins having the amino terminus in cytosol and carboxyl terminus on the other side of the membrane. They interact dynamically with their polypeptide substrates. In ppGalNAcT2, the R-type lectin domain interacts primarily with GalNAc on modified residues, whereas other regions of the polypeptide substrate lie in a groove next to the active site of the catalytic domain. The proximity of these two interactions positions the enzyme to bind special acceptor peptides.'
 'Recently, a second β-linked O-glucose modification site has been identified between the third and the fourth Cys of the EGF repeats at the putative consensus sequence C3XNTXGSFXC4 (Figure 13.1A), which is found in more than 30 proteins in mouse and human databases. Homologs of POGLUT1, termed POGLUT2 and POGLUT3, are responsible for modifying this site. The O-glucose at this site has not been reported to be elongated past the monosaccharide. Although β-linked O-GlcNAc is very common on proteins in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments (Chapter 19), the same modification can be found in comparatively few membrane and secreted proteins. Addition of O-GlcNAc occurs between the fifth and sixth conserved Cys of an EGF repeat at the putative consensus C5XXXX(S/T)GX2-3C6 (Figure 13.1A) in mouse and Drosophila Notch. However, sites have been mapped on only a few proteins. The O-GlcNAc can be elongated by β1,4Gal followed by a sialic acid to form Siaα2-3/6Galβ1-4GlcNAc. The EGF-specific O-GlcNAc transferase, EOGT, is distinct from OGT, the GlcNAc-transferase that modifies nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (Chapter 19). Inactivation of Drosophila Eogt is pupal lethal and causes a wing-blistering defect if deleted in the wing. The Drosophila phenotype can be explained by an EOGT substrate Dumpy and no obvious Notch-deficient phenotypes have been observed. However, genetic interactions between eogt and Notch pathway gene mutations occur in the fly and mutations in human EOGT result in skin and skeletal problems in AOS (Adams–Oliver syndrome type 4; OMIM 615297), a disorder with links to the Notch pathway. Consistently, EOGT in mice regulates vascular development and integrity by potentiating Delta-like ligand-mediated Notch signaling. O-Fucose is also found on TSRs. Similar to EGF repeats, TSRs are small protein domains (50–60 amino acids) with six conserved Cys that form three disulfide bonds (Figure 13.4). Like EGF repeats, TSRs are found in a subset of cell-surface and secreted proteins in metazoans, and they appear to function in protein–protein interactions. The O-fucose site occurs between the first and second conserved Cys residues at the putative consensus sequence C1X2(S/T)C2 in TSRs in about 50 proteins (Table 13.1). The O-fucose on TSRs can be elongated to form the disaccharide Glcβ1-3Fucα-O-Ser/Thr, first observed in 1975 in glycosides from human urine. The enzyme that fucosylates TSRs is POFUT2. It is expressed in many cells and tissues and is distinct from POFUT1. Elimination of Pofut2 in mice results in early embryonic lethality with defects in gastrulation. The gene encoding the β3-glucosyltransferase that elongates O-fucose on TSRs is B3GLCT. Mutations in B3GLCT in humans result in a multifaceted severe developmental disorder known as Peters-plus syndrome (OMIM 261540). Elimination of B3glct in mice phenocopies many of the defects seen in Peters-plus syndrome. TSRs are also often frequently modified with C-mannose (Figure 13.4), although the relationship between the two modifications is not yet clear. A number of biologically interesting proteins are known or predicted to contain this modification, including thrombospondin-1 and -2, all ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; ADAMTS 1–20) and ADAMTS-like proteins, properdin, and F-spondin (Table 13.1).']","The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER.","The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER. On binding to the catalytic STT3 subunit, the client peptide adopts a 180° turn, making polypeptide folding a competing reaction for N-glycosylation. Indeed, the thioredoxin subunits of the OST complex (Ost3p/Ost6p; MAGT1/TUSC1) modulate the oxidative folding of the client polypeptide, thereby extending the polypeptide substrate range of OST.

"Complete the following paragraph: Sialic acids may be modified by O-acetylation, and Gal and GlcNAc by sulfation. The length of O-GalNAc glycans may vary from a single GalNAc to more than 20 sugar residues and can include blood group and other glycan epitopes. This chapter describes the structures, biosynthesis, and functions of O-GalNAc glycans in mammals.","['GAL3ST4 is the major sulfotransferase acting on the Gal residue of core 1 O-glycans. Skeletal type keratan sulfate (KS) is also an O-GalNAc-linked highly sulfated polysaccharide (Chapter 17). O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer. The α1-2 fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 synthesize the blood group H determinant of O-GalNAc glycans which can be converted by an α1-3 Gal-transferase to blood group B or by an α1-3 GalNAc-transferase to blood group A (Table 10.1). In addition, α1-3 and α1-3/4 fucosyltransferases synthesize the Lewis antigens (Table 10.1). A number of uncommon and antigenic sugars are also found on O-GalNAc glycans. For example, neuropilin-2 in the nervous system has core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans that carry polysialic acid residues synthesized by polysialytransferase IV (ST8SIA4). These highly charged glycans play a critical role in the negative regulation of cell adhesion during maturation of the nervous system. An α1-4 GlcNAc-transferase in gastric tissue adds GlcNAc in α1-4 linkage to β1-4 Gal in core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans. The α1-4 GlcNAc-containing glycans appear to inhibit colonization by Helicobacter pylori. The functions of O-GalNAc glycans are many and varied, depending on their structure and density, as well on as the protein to which they are attached. As mentioned above, in densely glycosylated proteins such as mucins, O-glycans aid in hydration, structural support, interaction with the microbiome, and protection from proteolysis. In contrast, the function of single sites of O-GalNAc glycosylation vary widely and are still being determined. For example, O-GalNAc glycosylation at one or a few sites in certain proteins has been shown to regulate proprotein convertase cleavage, shedding of ectodomains, ligand binding, and cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, influencing tissue formation and differentiation. Moreover, O-glycans, either in defined sites or clusters, may serve as carriers of terminal ligands such as blood type antigens like sialyl-Lewis x, which are important for host–pathogen interactions, and the circulation and homing of immune cells. The ligands for certain selectin-mediated interactions between endothelial cells and leukocytes require sialyl-Lewis x that is commonly attached to core 2 O-GalNAc glycans (Table 10.1). Finally, O-glycan terminal motifs on some immune cell subtypes can engage specific Siglecs and induce tolerance to self-antigens. Methods to determine the function of O-GalNAc glycans are diverse and include the use of biosynthetic inhibitors, the construction of cell lines that lack or overexpress specific enzymes in O-glycosylation pathways, the use of O-GalNAc glycan-specific lectins or antibodies, removal of specific sugar residues by glycosidases, and deletion/mutation of specific GALNTs in model organisms. For example, a critical role of O-GalNAc glycans in selectin-mediated cell adhesion was revealed by treating cells with GalNAc-O-benzyl, which is a competitive inhibitor of core 1 and core 2 synthesis. GalNAc-O-benzyl acts as a decoy substrate for C1GALT1 and thereby reduces the synthesis of core 1 and core 2 O-GalNAc glycans on glycoproteins. Inhibitor-treated cancer cells lose the ability to bind to E-selectin and endothelial cells in vitro. Cancer cells often express sialyl-Lewis x and may thus use the selectin-binding properties of sialyl-Lewis x as a mechanism to invade tissues.'
 'They can also carry Sia and form sialyl-Tn or sialyl-T antigens. O-GalNAc cores are often extended to form complex O-GalNAc glycans that may include the ABO and Lewis blood group determinants (Chapter 14), polysialic acid, the linear i antigen (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Gal), and the GlcNAc β1-6-branched I antigens (Table 10.1). Extensions by Type 1 (Galβ1-3GlcNAc) or Type 2 (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) units can be repeated and provide scaffolds for the attachment of additional sugars or functional groups. The termini of O-GalNAc glycans may contain Fuc and Sia in α-linkages, and Gal, GalNAc, and GlcNAc in both α- and β-linkages, and sulfate. Many of these terminal sugars are antigenic or recognized by lectins. In particular, the sialylated and sulfated Lewis antigens are ligands for selectins (Chapter 34), and Gal-terminating structures are ligands for galectins (Chapter 36). Some sugar residues, or their modifications, may mask underlying antigens or receptors. For example, O-acetyl groups on the Sia of the sialyl-Tn antigen prevent recognition by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. Gut bacteria may actively remove this mask. Dense O-glycosylation of mucin domains provides almost complete protection from protease degradation. The O-linkage between GalNAc and Ser/Thr residues is labile under alkaline conditions. Thus, O-GalNAc glycans can be released by a reaction termed β-elimination (i.e., treatment with 0.1 m sodium hydroxide). The hemiacetal GalNAc produced will undergo rapid alkali-catalyzed degradation under these conditions (called peeling), but can be reduced with sodium borohydride to yield stable N-acetylgalactosaminitol at the reducing end of the released O-glycan. β-Elimination is the method of choice to release O-glycans from glycoproteins that also have N-glycans, because the latter are not susceptible to cleavage under mild conditions. O-GalNAc glycans, as well as other Ser/Thr-linked glycans (Chapter 13), are released as alditols by β-elimination, but with losses of labile O-acetyl or sulfate esters. An alternative method that preserves the reducing end of O-GalNAc uses ammonia followed by boric acid. O-GalNAc that is not substituted with another sugar can be enzymatically released by a N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Another glycosidase, termed O-glycanase, releases core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAc-) from Ser/Thr, provided the disaccharide is not further substituted. Thus, sialidase treatment followed by O-glycanase releases most simple, core 1 O-GalNAc glycans. Terminal Sia residues can also be easily removed with mild acid treatment. There are no known enzymes that can release more complex and extended whole O-GalNAc glycans, but mixtures of exoglycosidases can be used to sequentially remove sugars from O-GalNAc glycans on a glycoprotein. Glycoproteins with clusters of sialylated O-GalNAc glycans may be digested by an O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase. Released, intact O-GalNAc glycans may be separated by different chromatographic methods, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chemical derivatization of GalNAc at the reducing end helps in the separation and subsequent analysis of sugar composition and linkages by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) (Chapter 50). Another tool to isolate O-glycans with specific epitopes is affinity chromatography using lectins. For example, Helix pomatia agglutinin binds to terminal GalNAc, whereas peanut lectin binds to unsubstituted core 1 (Table 10.1).'
 'Chemical derivatization of GalNAc at the reducing end helps in the separation and subsequent analysis of sugar composition and linkages by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) (Chapter 50). Another tool to isolate O-glycans with specific epitopes is affinity chromatography using lectins. For example, Helix pomatia agglutinin binds to terminal GalNAc, whereas peanut lectin binds to unsubstituted core 1 (Table 10.1). The structures of O-GalNAc glycans released from mucins and other glycoproteins may be determined by a combination of liquid or gas chromatography, MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The anomeric linkage of each sugar can be determined using specific glycosidases that distinguish between α- or β-linked sugars, and by one- and two-dimensional NMR methods (Chapter 50). The sites of O-GalNAc glycan modification in mucins are difficult to determine directly, but this has been achieved by sensitive MS methods and new enzymatic tools. A big step forward in understanding the extent of the O-GalNAc glycoproteome came with the proteome-wide mapping of O-GalNAc glycosylation sites. Several MS-based strategies have been applied including modifications of the endogenous glycan structures through chemical labeling, lectin enrichment of glycans derived from native or glycoengineered cells, or O-GalNAc-specific endo-peptidase treatment. Additionally, the use of mucin-type O-proteases (OpeRATOR and StcE) that specifically cleave N-terminal to an O-glycosylated Ser/Thr have aided in mapping sites of glycosylation. Based on these methodologies, we now know that >80% of the proteins passing through the secretory pathway are modified with O-GalNAc glycans, although the occupancy and the nature of an O-GalNAc glycan associated with a glycosylated site remains elusive. O-GalNAc glycans are added to Ser/Thr residues in proteins in the Golgi apparatus. The biosynthetic glycosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic tail at the amino terminus, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a catalytic domain in the lumen of the Golgi. The arrangement within Golgi membranes appears to be similar to an “assembly line” with early reactions occurring in the cis-Golgi and late reactions in the trans-Golgi (Chapter 4). Many of the enzymes, however, are diffusely distributed in Golgi compartments. The subcellular localization, activity levels, and substrate specificities of glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of O-GalNAc glycans play a critical role in determining the range of O-glycans synthesized by a cell (Table 10.2 and Figures 10.2 and 10.3). The glycosyltransferases that are involved in the assembly of O-GalNAc glycans are listed in Table 10.2. However, other enzymes that contribute to the synthesis of N-glycans and glycolipids also act on O-glycans, and some of these prefer O-glycans as acceptor substrates (Chapter 14). In vitro assays have shown that the activities of glycosyltransferases are controlled by factors such as metal ions and pH. Biosynthesis of core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans as described in the text. Green lines are protein.  Glycosyltransferases that synthesize O-GalNAc glycans  The first and essential step of O-GalNAc glycosylation is the addition of GalNAc in α-linkage to Ser or Thr by a polypeptide GalNAc-transferase (ppGalNAcT; GALNT) (Table 10.2; Figure 10.2). Humans have 20 genes encoding GALNTs. The large number of GALNTs provides redundancy and also reflects differences in substrate specificity. Studies in the fly indicate that certain GALNTs (PGANTs in the fly) are required for normal development (Chapter 26). Deletion of single GALNTs in mammals results in organ and cell differentiation defects.'

Many glycoproteins carry glycans initiated by GalNAc attached to the hydroxyl of Ser or Thr residues. Mucins are the class of glycoproteins carrying the greatest number of O-GalNAc glycans (also called mucin-type O-glycans), but this posttranslational modification is common among many glycoproteins. The sugars found in O-GalNAc glycans include GalNAc, Gal, GlcNAc, Fuc, and Sia, whereas Man, Glc, or Xyl residues are not represented. Sialic acids may be modified by O-acetylation, and Gal and GlcNAc by sulfation. The length of O-GalNAc glycans may vary from a single GalNAc to more than 20 sugar residues and can include blood group and other glycan epitopes. This chapter describes the structures, biosynthesis, and functions of O-GalNAc glycans in mammals. About 150 years ago, E. Eichwald and E. Hoppe-Seyler noted that highly glycosylated proteins that contain hundreds of O-GalNAc glycans, which they termed mucins, are found throughout the body (Figure 10.1). Since then we have learned that O-GalNAc glycans are not only found as dense clusters on mucins, but also at single sites on most secreted and membrane-bound proteins. O-GalNAc glycans are involved in almost every aspect of biology, including cell–cell communication, cell adhesion, signal transduction, immune surveillance, epithelial cell protection, and host–pathogen interactions. A simplified model of a large secreted mucin. The PTS domain, rich in Pro, Thr, and Ser, is highly O-glycosylated on Ser/Thr. The mucin assumes an extended “bottle brush” conformation. The cysteine-rich regions form disulfide bonds generating (more...) GalNAc O-linked to Ser/Thr is the initiating sugar of O-GalNAc glycans and is usually extended to form one of four common core structures (Table 10.1; Figure 10.1). Each core can subsequently be extended to give a mature linear or branched O-GalNAc glycan. O-GalNAc glycan cores and antigenic epitopes of mucins  The great variety of O-GalNAc glycans often makes it very difficult to assign functions to individual O-GalNAc glycans at particular attachment sites, and most functions have historically been ascribed to the densely glycosylated mucins. In mucins, O-GalNAc glycans control chemical, physical, and biological properties. Because O-GalNAc glycans are hydrophilic, and usually negatively charged, they promote binding of water and salts and are major contributors to the viscosity and adhesiveness of mucins and the mucus they form. Mucins line the epithelial surfaces of the body, including the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts, where they shield epithelial cells against physical and chemical damage and protect against infection. Mucins can be antiadhesive and repel cell-surface interactions or, alternatively, promote adhesion by mediating recognition of glycan-binding proteins via their O-GalNAc glycans. A number of diseases are associated with abnormal mucin gene expression and abnormal mucin O-GalNAc glycans. These include cancer (Chapter 47), inflammatory bowel disease, congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45), and hypersecretory bronchial and lung diseases. Humans have about 20 different mucin genes encoding both secreted and membrane-bound mucins, which vary considerably in their primary sequence and tissue-specific expression.'
 'Humans have 20 genes encoding GALNTs. The large number of GALNTs provides redundancy and also reflects differences in substrate specificity. Studies in the fly indicate that certain GALNTs (PGANTs in the fly) are required for normal development (Chapter 26). Deletion of single GALNTs in mammals results in organ and cell differentiation defects. The GALNTs are found throughout the animal kingdom but not in bacteria, yeast, or plants. All GALNTs are classified in the GT27 CaZy family with a GT-A fold (Chapter 8), and most have a lectin (ricin-like) domain at the carboxyl terminus, which is unique among glycosyltransferases. GALNTs coordinate the transfer of GalNAc from the donor substrate (UDP-GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr on acceptor substrates and fall into two general categories: those that require the presence of an extant GalNAc on a peptide or protein before they will add additional GalNAcs (glycopeptide-preferring transferases), and those that will transfer GalNAc to a modified or unmodified protein (peptide transferases). Crystal structures of a number of GALNTs have revealed key details in the mechanisms of action of these enzymes and their unique substrate specificities. The conserved DXH motif found in all GALNTs coordinates Mn++ and UDP-GalNAc binding. Acceptor substrate preferences are dictated by unique amino acids present within the catalytic domain of each GALNT. For example, some GALNTs have “proline pockets” within the catalytic domain, thus conferring a strong preference for Pro residues near the site of O-glycosylation. The lectin domain recognizes extant O-GalNAc residues on previously glycosylated substrates to position the catalytic domain for further GalNAc addition. More recent work has demonstrated that charged residues within the lectin domain can also influence the glycosylation of charged protein substrates (in the absence of prior glycosylation). Additionally, the flexible linker in between the catalytic and lectin domains (which varies in length and sequence among the GALNTs) has been shown to influence sites of GalNAc addition. Databases that estimate the likelihood of O-glycosylation at a specific site are based on known sequences around O-glycosylation sites, as well as in vitro determinations of sequence preferences for certain GALNTs (e.g., NetOGlyc and ISOGlyP). However, these predictions do not account for the different GALNTs expressed in the cell type producing a particular glycoprotein and do not apply to mucins. Because of overlapping localization of GALNTs and the extension enzymes, it is likely that a heterogeneous mixture of different O-GalNAc glycans is present on all mature glycoproteins. Also, the presence of O-GalNAc glycans on proteins is likely often missed because of this limited predictive value of surrounding amino acid sequence. As mentioned above, O-GalNAc glycan synthesis begins with the transfer of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to Ser/Thr catalyzed by a GALNT. Although a single, unextended GalNAc linked to Ser/Thr (the Tn antigen) is uncommon in normal mucins, it is often found at increased levels in tumor mucins. This suggests that the extension of O-GalNAc glycans beyond the first sugar is blocked in some cancer cells. Sia added to GalNAc by the α2-6 sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC1 generates the sialyl-Tn antigen, which is common in advanced tumors. Other sugars are not known to be added to this O-glycan, but it can be O-acetylated by Sia O-acetyltransferase, which prevents detection by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. The addition of one or two neutral sugars to O-GalNAc generates one of the different cores of O-GalNAc glycans (Table 10.1; Figure 10.2). Core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) is generated by C1GALT1.']","O-GalNAc glycans in mammals exhibit a wide range of lengths, from a single GalNAc to over 20 sugar residues, encompassing various blood group and other glycan epitopes.

Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a subclass of glycolipids found in the cell membranes of organisms from bacteria to humans, are the major glycolipids of animals. The emphasis of this chapter is on vertebrate glycosphingolipids. Information on glycolipids of fungi, plants, and invertebrates is covered elsewhere (Chapters 20 and 23–26), as are glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), glycolipids attached to proteins as membrane anchors (Chapter 12). This chapter describes the characteristic features of GSLs, pathways for their biosynthesis, and insights into their biological roles in membrane structure, host–pathogen interactions, cell–cell recognition, and modulation of membrane protein function. The first GSL to be characterized was galactosylceramide (GalCer). Among the simplest of glycolipids, it is also one of the most abundant molecules in the vertebrate brain. It consists of a single galactose residue in β-glycosidic linkage to the C-1 hydroxyl group of a lipid moiety called ceramide (Figure 11.1). The structure of the lipid, a long-chain amino alcohol in amide linkage to a fatty acid, was so difficult to determine that the amino alcohol was dubbed “sphingosine” after the enigmatic Egyptian Sphinx. Animal cells synthesize various sphingosines and related long-chain amino alcohols, together referred to as sphingoid bases. Nearly all glycolipids in vertebrates are GSLs, which, in turn, are part of the larger family of sphingolipids (lipids built on sphingoid bases) that includes the major membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, and the second messenger sphingosine 1-phosphate that regulates angiogenesis and immune cell trafficking. Other GSLs were later identified because they accumulate to pathological levels in tissues of patients with lysosomal storage diseases, genetic disorders in which glycan degrading enzymes are faulty or missing (Chapter 44). For example, a sialic acid–containing GSL (GM2) was first isolated from the brain of a victim of Tay–Sachs disease, in which it accumulates, and was named “ganglioside” based on its location in nerve clusters or “ganglia” in the brain. Likewise, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was first isolated from the spleen of a Gaucher disease patient, where it accumulates. As purification, separation, and analytical techniques improved, GSLs were found in all vertebrate tissues. Hundreds of unique GSL structures were found that vary in glycan structures alone, each of which are presented on several distinct ceramides. Structures of representative glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and glycoglycerolipids. GSLs, such as GalCer, are built on a ceramide lipid moiety that consists of a long-chain amino alcohol (sphingosine) in amide linkage to a fatty acid. In comparison, glycoglycerolipids, (more...) Glycoglycerolipids are distinguished from GSLs by their lipid, having glycans linked to the C-3 hydroxyl of diacylglycerol or alkyl(acyl)glycerol (Figure 11.1). Very minor constituents of most animal tissues (other than the testes), glycoglycerolipids are widely distributed in microbes and plants. Glycolipids of fungi, plants, and invertebrates are covered in Chapters 20 and 23–26.'
 'Very minor constituents of most animal tissues (other than the testes), glycoglycerolipids are widely distributed in microbes and plants. Glycolipids of fungi, plants, and invertebrates are covered in Chapters 20 and 23–26. Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), a different family of glycolipids, are often attached to proteins as membrane, and may also exist as free glycolipids (discussed in Chapter 12). The lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria are discussed in Chapter 21. The ceramide lipid of GSLs consists of a sphingoid base with a fatty acid amide at the C-2 amine. Sphingosine is the most common sphingoid base in mammals, with hydroxyls at the C-1 and C-3 carbons and a trans double bond between C-4 and C-5 (Figure 11.1). Sphinganine is the same structure without the double bond, and phytosphingosine lacks the double bond and has an additional hydroxyl on C-4. Ceramides containing sphinganine and phytosphingosine are less abundant in animals, whereas phytosphingosine is prominent in the glycosphingolipids of plants and fungi. The fatty acid components of ceramides vary widely, with lengths ranging from C14 to C30 or greater. Although often saturated, they may be variably unsaturated or have α-hydroxyl groups. Ceramide structures modulate membrane associations and functions of GSLs. Although ceramide variations add significant diversity to GSL structures, major structural and functional classifications are based on the glycans. The first sugars linked to ceramide in vertebrates are typically β-linked galactose (GalCer) or glucose (GlcCer). GalCer and its analog sulfatide, with sulfate at the C-3 hydroxyl of galactose, are the major glycans in the kidney and the brain. In the brain they have essential roles in the structure and function of myelin, the insulator that allows for rapid nerve conduction. Interestingly, the related sulfogalactoglycerolipid, seminolipid (Figure 11.1), is abundant only in the male reproductive tract, where it is essential for spermatogenesis. Sialylated GalCer (Neu5Acα2-3GalβCer; GM4) is also found in myelin. These galactolipids are seldom extended with larger saccharide chains; rather, most other members of the large and diverse family of GSLs in animals are built on GlcCer (Figure 11.2). GlcCer itself is abundant in certain tissues. In skin, it is a precursor of special ceramides that are required for creating the essential surface water barrier when embedded into the stratum corneum of the epidermis (see below). Glycosphingolipid (GSL) neutral cores and their designation based on IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) Nomenclature. In the official nomenclature, saccharide and other substituents that extend or branch from the neutral core structures (more...) The vast majority of GSL structures are classified based on seven common tetrasaccharide neutral sugar core sequences (Figure 11.2). GSLs sharing the same neutral core sequence are said to be of that “series”; the quantitatively major series in vertebrates are ganglio-, globo-, and neolacto-series, whereas in invertebrates the mollu- and arthro-series predominate. GSL series are expressed in tissue-specific patterns. In mammals, ganglio-series GSLs, although broadly distributed, predominate in the brain, whereas neolacto-series glycolipids are common on certain hematopoietic cells including leukocytes. In contrast, lacto-series glycolipids are prominent in secretory organs and globo-series glycolipids are the most abundant in erythrocytes. This diversity presumably reflects important differences in GSL functions. GSLs are further subclassified as neutral (no charged sugars or ionic groups), sialylated (having one or more sialic acid residues), or sulfated.'
 'In contrast, guinea pig, mouse, sheep, and goat are Forssman antigen–positive. The breakdown of GSLs occurs stepwise by the action of lysosomal hydrolases. GSLs on the outer surface of the plasma membrane are internalized, along with other membrane components, in invaginated vesicles that then fuse with endosomes, resulting in the GSL glycan facing the endosome lumen. GSL-enriched areas of the endosomal membrane may then invaginate once again to form intraluminal vesicles within the endosome. When endosomes fuse with primary lysosomes, GSLs become exposed to lysosomal hydrolases. Absence of any one of these glycosidases results in lysosomal storage diseases (Chapter 44). As GSLs are successively cleaved to smaller structures, the remaining “core” monosaccharides become inaccessible to the water-soluble lysosomal hydrolases and require assistance from activator proteins that are referred to as “liftases.” These include GM2-activator protein and four structurally related saposins, all of which are derived from a single polypeptide precursor by proteolytic cleavage. Saposins are thought to bind to their glycolipid substrate, disrupt its interaction with the local membrane environment, and facilitate access of the glycans to the water-soluble hydrolytic enzymes. In certain lysosomal storage diseases (Chapter 44), mutations in activator proteins result in pathological accumulation of glycolipids, even though there is an abundance of the hydrolase responsible for degradation, thus demonstrating the essential role of activator proteins in GSL catabolism in vivo. The final breakdown products of GSL catabolism—monosaccharides, fatty acids, and free sphingoid bases—are then available for reuse by salvage pathways. GSLs comprise from <5% (erythrocytes) to >20% (myelin) of the total membrane lipids in the plasma membranes of vertebrate cells. However, they are not uniformly distributed in the plane of the membrane but cluster in “lipid rafts,” small lateral microdomains of self-associating membrane molecules. Although the precise structure and makeup of lipid rafts is a matter of ongoing debate, their outer leaflets are believed to be enriched in sphingolipids, including GSLs and sphingomyelin (the phosphocholine derivative of ceramide). The self-association of sphingolipids is driven through the unique biophysical properties imparted by their long saturated carbon chains (Figure 11.1). Besides sphingolipids, lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol and selected proteins, including GPI-anchored proteins and some transmembrane signaling proteins such as receptor tyrosine kinases. On the cytoplasmic side, acylated proteins, such as Src family protein tyrosine kinases and Gα subunits of G proteins, associate with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are apparently dynamic, short-lived (msec), and small (10–50 nm in diameter), each containing perhaps hundreds of lipid molecules along with a few protein molecules. It has been argued that external clustering of lipid rafts into larger structures might bring signaling molecules such as kinases and their substrates together to enhance intracellular signaling. Thus, GSLs may act as intermediaries in the flow of information from the outside to the inside of cells. This idea is supported by the observation that antibody-induced GSL clustering activates lipid-raft-associated signaling and has led to the concept of plasma membrane “glycosignaling domains” or “glycosynapse.” Interactions between glycans and glycan-binding proteins, as well as glycan–glycan interactions, are also very much influenced by the density of glycans in terms of binding affinity. Multiple glycans clustered in a limited area can increase the avidity of cognate binding proteins compared with a single molecule of a glycan (Chapter 29). Natural multivalency adds unique functional properties to plasma membrane glycolipids. Indeed, several growth factor receptors including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, insulin receptor, and the nerve growth factor receptor are localized in membrane microdomains, and structural studies identified binding sites occupied by specific GSLs that modulate receptor signaling functions.'
 ""Infants with severe Gaucher disease, in which β-glucocerebrosidase activity is nearly absent and GlcCer is not catabolized, are prone to dehydration because of high skin permeability. The relationship among GlcCer, ceramide, and skin permeability was confirmed in mice engineered with the same mutation in β-glucocerebrosidase as found in these infants. The mice unable to catabolize GlcCer died within days of birth by dehydration through the skin. This established the role of GlcCer as the obligate precursor to the ceramide required to build the outermost protective layer (stratum corneum) of the skin. GlcCer is synthesized, transported to the stratum corneum, and then enzymatically hydrolyzed, resulting in ceramide deposition. More complex GSLs function both in cell–cell recognition and in the regulation of signal transduction. As with sulfatide, these functions are sometimes subtle, as exemplified by the effects of blocking ganglioside biosynthesis on nervous system physiology. Given the complexity of complex ganglioside biosynthesis (Figure 11.3), it was surprising to discover that major alterations in ganglioside expression resulted in only modest phenotypic changes in mice. When the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase responsible for ganglioside elongation (GM2/GD2 synthase) was inactivated in mice, none of the major complex gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, GD1b, or GT1b) were expressed, and a comparable concentration of the simple gangliosides GM3 and GD3 were found in the adult brain. The resulting mice were grossly normal, but as they aged, mice without the normal spectrum of brain gangliosides displayed signs of axon degeneration and demyelination, hallmarks of a problem in myelin–axon cell–cell communication. These deficits arise from loss of ganglioside binding to a protein on the myelin membrane, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a member of the Siglec family of sialic acid–dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins (Chapter 35). MAG is expressed on the innermost myelin wrap, directly across from the axon surface. Mice engineered to lack MAG have many of the same phenotypic changes as mice lacking GM2/GD2 synthase, and biochemical and cell-biological studies showed that the major brain gangliosides GD1a and GT1b are excellent ligands for MAG. These results support the conclusion that MAG on the innermost myelin membrane binds to GD1a and GT1b on the axon cell surface to stabilize myelin–axon interactions. Disruption of the same ganglioside biosynthetic gene in humans leads to a similar phenotype: hereditary spastic paraplegia. A second trans recognition role for GSLs is evident in the interaction of leukocytes with the blood vessel wall during the process of inflammation, the body's protection against bacterial infection. As discussed in Chapter 34, the first step in inflammation is the binding of white blood cells (leukocytes) to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessel near sites of infection (activated endothelium). This cell–cell interaction is initiated when glycan-binding proteins of the selectin family, expressed on the activated endothelium, bind to complementary glycans on the surface of passing leukocytes. One of the selectins, E-selectin, binds to glycoconjugates found on human leukocytes. The glycan receptor(s) for E-selectin are resistant to protease treatment, indicating that they may be GSLs. A candidate class of GSLs, myeloglycans, has been identified in leukocytes. The candidate GSLs have long sugar chains consisting of a neutral core with Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3 repeats (Chapter 14), substituted with a terminal sialic acid and fucose residues on one or more of the N-acetylglucosamine residues. Another role for GSLs in mediating inflammatory responses involves lipid-specific antigen presentation. Natural killer T (NKT) cells, which carry both T- and NKT-cell receptors, are involved in the suppression of autoimmune reactions, cancer metastasis, and the graft rejection response.""
 'In contrast, lacto-series glycolipids are prominent in secretory organs and globo-series glycolipids are the most abundant in erythrocytes. This diversity presumably reflects important differences in GSL functions. GSLs are further subclassified as neutral (no charged sugars or ionic groups), sialylated (having one or more sialic acid residues), or sulfated. Traditionally, all sialylated GSLs are known as “gangliosides” regardless of whether they are based on the ganglio-series neutral sugar core. In the official nomenclature, saccharide and other substituents that extend or branch from the neutral core structures are indicated by a roman numeral designating which of the neutral core sugars carries the substituent (counting the sugar closest to the ceramide as “I”), and a superscript designating which hydroxyl on that sugar is modified (Figure 11.2). This nomenclature is too complex for daily use, so the most common GSLs are usually referred to by unofficial names. For example, in the widely used nomenclature of Svennerholm, the ganglioside Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4(Neu5Acα2-3)Galβ1-4GlcβCer is designated “GM1” (Figure 11.3). In this nomenclature, G refers to ganglioside series, the second letter refers to the number of sialic acid residues (mono, di, tri, quattro [or tetra], penta, etc.), and the number (1, 2, 3, etc.) refers to the order of migration of the ganglioside on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (e.g., GM3 > GM2 > GM1) with respect to the starting point. Therefore, the neutral core oligosaccharide shrinks in size (and moves farther by TLC) as the number increases. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are synthesized by the stepwise addition of sugars first to ceramide and then to the growing glycans. Shown as examples are major brain GSLs. Ceramide (Cer) is the acceptor for UDP-Gal:ceramide β-galactosyltransferase (more...) Organic solvents are used to extract glycolipids from tissues and cells, where they are found primarily in the external leaflet of plasma membranes. Extraction procedures, most often using defined chloroform–methanol–water mixtures, are optimized to precipitate and remove proteins and nucleic acids while maximizing solubilization of GSLs (along with other lipids). Because GSLs aggregate with one another and other lipids in aqueous solution, organic solvents are used throughout subsequent purification steps, which typically involve solvent partition, ion-exchange, and adsorption chromatographies. Because of their amphipathic nature, glycolipids are well-suited for TLC analysis, which is useful for monitoring their purification, qualitative and quantitative determination of their expression in normal and diseased tissues, partial structural analysis, and detecting biological activities including immunoreactivity and binding activity toward toxins, viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells. After separation by TLC, picomole to nanomole quantities of glycolipids can be chemically detected with orcinol reagent for hexoses and with resorcinol-HCl reagent for sialic acid. Normal phase TLC robustly resolves GSLs based on oligosaccharide diversity but is less effective at separating differences due to ceramides. To study glycolipid receptors, TLC-resolved glycolipids are overlaid with potential binding proteins or organisms (e.g., antibodies, lectins, toxins, viruses, bacteria, or cells). After washing, glycolipid species that bind can be identified by detection of the bound material at precise positions on the TLC plate. Two-dimensional TLC with exposure to ammonia vapor after the first dimension can be useful in identifying the presence of O-acetyl modifications on sialic acids, which are especially common in the brain. Complete structural analyses of glycolipids require a combination of techniques to determine the composition, sequence, linkage positions, and anomeric configurations of the glycan moiety and the fatty acid and long-chain base of the ceramide moiety.']","GSLs, or glycosphingolipids, are a major type of glycolipids found in vertebrates. They are part of the broader family of sphingolipids, which are lipids built on sphingoid bases.

Plasma membrane proteins are either peripheral proteins or integral membrane proteins. The latter include proteins that span the lipid bilayer once or several times, and a second class that are covalently attached to lipids. Proteins attached to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) via their carboxyl termini are generally found in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer facing the extracellular environment. The GPI membrane anchor may be conveniently thought of as an alternative to the single transmembrane domain of type-I integral membrane proteins. This chapter reviews the discovery, distribution, structure, biosynthesis, properties, and suggested functions of GPI anchors and related molecules, as well as their roles in diseases. The first tentative evidence for the existence of protein-phospholipid anchors appeared in 1963 with the finding that crude bacterial phospholipase C (PLC) selectively releases alkaline phosphatase from mammalian cells. Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-protein anchors were first postulated in the mid-1970s when highly purified bacterial PI-specific PLCs were observed to release proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase, from mammalian plasma membranes. By 1985, these predictions were confirmed by compositional and structural data from studies on Torpedo acetylcholinesterase, human and bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase, rat Thy-1, and the sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The first complete GPI structures, which were for T. brucei VSG and rat Thy-1, were solved in 1988 (Chapter 1, Figure 1.3). To date, hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) have been identified in many eukaryotes, ranging from protozoa and fungi to plants and humans (Online Appendix 12A). The range of described GPI-APs and the distribution of putative GPI biosynthesis genes suggests that (1) GPI anchors are almost ubiquitous among eukaryotes; (2) GPI-APs are functionally diverse and include hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion molecules, complement regulatory proteins, receptors, protozoan coat proteins, and prion proteins; and (3) in mammals, alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing may lead to the expression of transmembrane and/or soluble and GPI-anchored forms of the same gene product. These variants may be developmentally regulated. For example, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) exists in GPI-anchored and soluble forms when expressed in muscle and in GPI-anchored and two transmembrane forms when expressed in brain. The substructure Manα1-4GlcNα1-6myo-inositol-1-P-lipid is a universal hallmark of GPI anchors and related structures. All but one protein-linked GPI anchor share a larger common core structure (Figure 12.1; Online Appendix 12B, panels I–IV). The protein–carbohydrate association in GPI-APs is unique in that the reducing terminus of the GPI oligosaccharide is not attached to the protein but to the D-myo-inositol head group of a PI moiety by an α1-6 linkage. A distal, nonreducing mannose (Man) is attached to the protein via an ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) bridge between its C-6 hydroxyl and the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy-terminal amino acid. GPIs are one of the rare instances in which GlcN is found without either an N-acetyl or N-sulfate (as in proteoglycans) moiety (Chapter 17).'
 'An α2-3 sialic acid (Sia) could be added to the Gal. In T. brucei bloodstream forms, GPI-APs present glycan side-chains consisting of Gal, whereas the procyclic GPIs carry sialylated poly-N-acetyllactosamine and poly-lacto-N-biose structures. The transport of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi is mediated by coat protein II (COPII)-coated transport vesicles. Their packaging into the vesicles requires a transmembrane cargo receptor, a complex of four p24 family proteins, that links luminally oriented GPI to COPII components on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. GPI-APs with two long hydrocarbon chains (i.e., those containing diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol, alkenylacylglycerol, or ceramide) are stably associated with the lipid bilayer. It follows that inositol-acylated GPI proteins with three fatty-acid chains should be more stably associated. On the other hand, Leishmania LPG, with a single C24:0 alkyl chain, has a half-life of only minutes at the cell surface and is secreted intact into the medium. The thermodynamics of bilayer interactions also depend on the length and degree of saturation of the fatty-acid chains. In this regard, the saturated nature of most (but not all) mammalian GPI anchors (Online Appendix 12B, panels III and IV) is thought to explain why GPI-APs associate with “lipid rafts.” The current model for mammalian lipid rafts is that of transient liquid-ordered nanoclusters of membrane components. These are dependent on dynamic cortical actin asters that, through adaptor proteins, cluster phosphatidylserine (PS) on the inner face of the plasma membrane bilayer. This coupling effect occurs because the long, saturated lipid chains from inner leaflet PS overlap and interact with those of GPI-APs and glycosphingolipids in the middle of the bilayer, thereby generating functional membrane domains. A compelling aspect of this model is that, although dynamic cortical actin can organize molecules across the leaflet into nanoclusters, the clustering of GPI-APs or glycosphingolipids at the outer leaflet can also, conversely, organize the inner leaflet and recruit molecules that may favor liquid-ordered domains. This provides a possible explanation for the perplexing, yet well-characterized, ability of GPI-APs to transduce signals across the plasma membrane. There are many examples of transmembrane signaling via the cross-linking of GPI-APs with antibodies and clustering with a second antibody on various cells, particularly leukocytes. Cellular responses include an increase in intracellular Ca++, tyrosine phosphorylation, proliferation, cytokine induction, and oxidative burst. These signaling events are dependent on the presence of a GPI anchor and might be mostly caused by the induction and coalescence of lipid raft nanoclusters, although their participation in ligand binding in conjunction with signal receptors (such as receptor-like-kinases in Arabidopsis) to transduce extracellular signals cannot be ruled out. GPI-APs involved in transmembrane signaling, such as the glial-cell-(line-)derived neurotrophic factor receptor-α (GDNFR-α), need to be associated with transmembrane β coreceptors to transmit their signals. Similarly, GPI-anchored CD14 (the LPS/LPS-binding protein receptor) requires to partner transmembrane Toll-like receptor-4, and can function equally well with a GPI anchor or with a spliced transmembrane domain. The replacement of carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains of type-I integral membrane proteins by GPIsps allows their expression as GPI-APs on the plasma membrane of transfected mammalian cells. This offers a useful method for producing soluble forms of membrane proteins. For example, the T-cell receptor was rendered soluble after it was expressed in the GPI-anchored form (by the action of bacterial PI-PLC), and not by simply expressing the transmembrane-deleted domain. In addition, purified GPI-APs can be used to coat hydrophobic surface plasmon resonance chips, thus providing a convenient method for orienting and presenting proteins for binding studies.'
 'A distal, nonreducing mannose (Man) is attached to the protein via an ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) bridge between its C-6 hydroxyl and the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy-terminal amino acid. GPIs are one of the rare instances in which GlcN is found without either an N-acetyl or N-sulfate (as in proteoglycans) moiety (Chapter 17). General structure of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors attached to proteins. All characterized GPI anchors share a common core consisting of ethanolamine-PO4-6Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcNα1-6myo-inositol-1-PO4-lipid. (more...) Beyond the common core, the structures of mature GPI anchors are quite diverse, depending on both the protein to which they are attached and the organism in which they are synthesized (Figure 12.1; Online Appendix 12B). Modifications to the core include additional EtNP and a wide variety of linear and branched glycosyl substituents of largely unknown function. There is considerable variation in the PI moiety. Indeed, GPI is a rather loose term because, strictly speaking, PI refers specifically to D-myo-inositol-1-P-3(sn-1,2-diacylglycerol) (i.e., diacyl-PI), whereas many GPIs contain other types of inositolphospholipids, such as lysoacyl-PI, alkylacyl-PI, alkenylacyl-PI, and inositolphosphoceramide (Online Appendix 12B). Another variation is the attachment of an ester-linked fatty acid at the C-2 hydroxyl of the inositol residue, which makes the anchor inherently resistant to bacterial PI-PLCs. The available structural data suggest that (1) inositolphosphoceramide-based protein-linked GPIs are mainly found in “lower” eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Trypanosoma cruzi; (2) the lipid structures of GPIs generally do not reflect those of the general cellular PI or inositolphosphoceramide pool; and (3) the lipid structures of some (e.g., trypanosome) GPI-APs are under developmental control. The factors controlling the synthesis of a mature protein-linked GPI appear to be similar to those for other posttranslational modifications such as N- and O-glycosylation. Thus, primary control occurs at the cellular level, whereby the levels of specific biosynthetic and processing enzymes dictate the final repertoire of structures. Secondary control occurs at the level of the tertiary/quaternary structures of the GPI-APs, which affect accessibility to processing enzymes. Examples of primary control include (1) differences in GPI glycan side chains in human versus porcine membrane dipeptidase and brain versus thymocyte rat Thy-1 and (2) differences in glycan side chains and the lipid structure of T. brucei VSG in the bloodstream versus insect life-cycle stages of the parasite. An example of secondary control is the difference in VSG glycan side chains when VSGs with different carboxy-terminal sequences are expressed in the same trypanosome clone. In mammalian cells, some free GPIs (mature and biosynthetic intermediates) are found at the cell surface, although their functional significance remains unknown. On the other hand, several protozoa (particularly trypanosomatids) express high numbers (>107 copies per cell) of free GPIs on their cell surface as metabolic end products. These include the so-called glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs) and lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) of Leishmania.'
 'This offers a useful method for producing soluble forms of membrane proteins. For example, the T-cell receptor was rendered soluble after it was expressed in the GPI-anchored form (by the action of bacterial PI-PLC), and not by simply expressing the transmembrane-deleted domain. In addition, purified GPI-APs can be used to coat hydrophobic surface plasmon resonance chips, thus providing a convenient method for orienting and presenting proteins for binding studies. It is clear that purified GPI-APs will spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers. The physiological significance of direct GPI-protein exchange between membranes is still uncertain, particularly because all mammals express potent GPI-PLD activity in serum that can remove the lipid (phosphatidic acid) component of the anchor and, thus, prevent GPI-protein re-insertion. However, the re-insertion property of GPI-APs has been exploited experimentally to “paint” exogenous proteins onto cell surfaces. GPI anchors are essential for life in some, but not all, eukaryotic microbes. In S. cerevisiae, and probably most fungi, the presence of a GPI anchor targets certain mannoproteins for covalent incorporation into the β-glucan layer of the cell wall via a transglycosylation reaction, whereby Man-1 within the GPI-anchor core is transferred to the β-glucan polymer, probably by the actions of Dfg5 and Dcw1. Defects in cell wall biosynthesis are detrimental to yeast and this may be one of the reasons why GPI biosynthesis is essential for this organism. Certain unique phenotypes of C. albicans GPI biosynthetic mutants are strictly associated with a single gene defect, suggestive of highly specific cross-talk of the related GPI biosynthetic step with other cellular pathways. GPI biosynthesis is essential for the bloodstream form of T. brucei, even in tissue culture. This may be due to nutritional stress, given that this parasite uses an essential GPI-anchored transferrin receptor. On the other hand, surprisingly, GPI biosynthesis and/or transfer to protein are not essential for the insect-dwelling forms of T. brucei or L. major. In Arabidopsis thaliana, GPI biosynthesis is required for cell wall synthesis, morphogenesis, and pollen tube development. The availability of GPI-deficient mammalian cell lines shows that GPI-APs are not essential at the cellular level. However, mouse knockouts and tissue-specific conditional knockouts of the PIGA gene clearly show that GPI-APs are essential for early embryo and tissue development. GPI anchors impart to their attached proteins the ability to be shed from the cell surface in soluble form through the action of cellular or serum GPI-cleaving enzymes. Mammalian sperms acquire the ability to fuse with oocytes after GPI-anchored TEX101 and LY6K are released by a sperm-associated GPI-cleaving enzyme tACE (testis form angiotensin converting enzyme). The cleavage of GPI-APs is required for maturation of ADAM3, a metalloprotease on the sperm surface. Certain proliferating motor neurons initiate differentiation after the GPI-anchored proteinase inhibitor, RECK, is released by the GPI-cleaving enzyme, GDE2. This relieves the inhibition of ADAM10 metalloproteinase, allowing it to degrade the Notch-ligand to terminate Notch signaling. Thus, the cell switches from proliferation to differentiation. GPI-anchored CRIPTO acts as a coreceptor for Nodal signaling. Shedding of CRIPTO by a GPI-phospholipase A2, PGAP6, followed by a PLD-like enzyme, regulates Nodal signaling. In “lower” eukaryotes, GPI anchors may be useful for assembling particularly dense cell-surface protein coats, such as the VSG coat of T. brucei. In this case, each parasite expresses five million VSG dimers on the cell surface to protect it against complement-mediated lysis. If each VSG monomer had a single transmembrane domain instead of a GPI anchor, there would be little room for other integral membrane proteins such as hexose and nucleoside transporters. Generally, GPI-APs do recycle through intracellular compartments but, compared to typical transmembrane proteins, they reside in higher proportions on the cell surface and have longer half-lives.'
 'Two processes are involved in these structural changes. First, remodeling from the diacyl-PI to diradyl-PI (mixtures of 1-alkyl-2-acyl-PI and diacyl-PI), having unsaturated fatty acid at the sn-2-position, occurs early in the pathway, within the ER, to produce GlcN-aPI with the remodeled lipid tail. The reaction responsible for this is not known, but alkyl phospholipids synthesized in the peroxisome serve as the alkyl donors. Second, fatty-acid remodeling, involving exchange of the unsaturated sn-2 fatty acid for a saturated fatty acid, mainly stearate (C18:0), occurs after the GPI-APs are transported to the Golgi. The GPI pathway genes were identified principally by expression cloning using GPI-deficient mutants of mammalian cells and temperature-sensitive yeast mutants. More recently, epitope tagging/pull-down/proteomic approaches have been used to identify GPI pathway–associated components. Some basic details of the known mammalian and yeast components and their topologies in the ER membrane are described in Table 12.1. Predicted topologies for the mammalian enzymes are shown in Figure 12.3. The GPI precursor is transferred to proteins via a multisubunit transamidase complex. The reaction involves two complex substrates, the preassembled GPI precursor and the carboxyl terminus of a partially folded nascent protein (Figure 12.4). The carboxy-terminal GPI-addition signal peptide (GPIsp) contains three domains: (1) three relatively small amino acids (Ala, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gly, or Ser) located at ω, ω+1, and ω+2, where ω is the amino acid attached to the GPI anchor and ω+1 and ω+2 are the first two residues of the cleaved peptide; (2) a relatively polar domain of typically five to 10 residues; and (3) a hydrophobic domain typically comprising 15–20 hydrophobic amino acids. These GPIsp sequences have no strict consensus, but are easily identified by eye and by automated algorithms. The final hydrophobic stretch of amino acids often resembles a transmembrane domain, but the absence of positively charged and polar residues immediately downstream makes a GPIsp easy to spot. Like N-glycosylation sequons, a GPIsp will only be functional if the protein is translocated into the ER. Hence, all GPI-APs are synthesized with an amino-terminal ER localization signal peptide as well. (A) Features of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and their processing by GPI transamidase. GPI-anchored proteins have an amino-terminal signal peptide for translocation into the ER and a carboxy-terminal GPI-addition signal peptide (more...) GPIs present microheterogeneity in their glycan side-chains depending on the species, cell types, and proteins (Online Appendix 12B, panels I–IV). A small number of enzymes involved in these reactions in mammals, yeast and T. brucei are known (Online Appendix 12B, panel V). Yeast and some mammalian GPIs possess a fourth α1-2Man (Man-4) residue added by Smp3/PIG-Z during GPI precursor assembly in the ER. Yeast GPI-APs have a fifth αMan (Man-5) residue added in the Golgi. A proportion of mammalian GPI-APs contain Man-1 modified by a β1-4N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and which may be further modified with a β1-4galactose (Gal), in the Golgi. An α2-3 sialic acid (Sia) could be added to the Gal. In T. brucei bloodstream forms, GPI-APs present glycan side-chains consisting of Gal, whereas the procyclic GPIs carry sialylated poly-N-acetyllactosamine and poly-lacto-N-biose structures. The transport of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi is mediated by coat protein II (COPII)-coated transport vesicles.']","The first tentative evidence for the existence of protein-phospholipid anchors appeared in 1963 with the finding that crude bacterial phospholipase C (PLC) selectively releases alkaline phosphatase from mammalian cells. Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-protein anchors were first postulated in the mid-1970s when highly purified bacterial PI-specific PLCs were observed to release proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase, from mammalian plasma membranes.

Freeze, Hamed Jafar-Nejad, Tetsuya Okajima, and Pamela Stanley. This chapter focuses on less-easily categorized types of glycan linkages that occur on certain proteins or domains. O-linked sugars on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (O-fucose, O-glucose, and O-GlcNAc) regulate Notch signaling and the functions of several other proteins. O-Fucosylation of thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) is required for folding of these domains in a number of secreted matricellular proteins. O-mannosylation of α-dystroglycan is essential for interactions with several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Defects in the glycosyltransferases that add these glycans (O-fucose, O-glucose, O-GlcNAc, and O-mannose) result in human diseases. C-Mannosylation is a unique form of glycosylation in which mannose is linked through a carbon–carbon bond to tryptophan. O-Linked Glc-Gal disaccharides are added to hydroxylysine residues and play an important role in collagen fibril formation. Although the glycans described here are found on relatively few glycoproteins, they play specific and important roles in biology. In glycoproteins, the linkage between the first sugar of a glycan and the protein defines its glycosylation class (Chapter 1, Figure 1.7) including the common GlcNAc-N-Asn, GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr, and Xyl-O-Ser linkages present in glycoproteins and proteoglycans. The novel, nonclassical glycan Glcβ1–3Fucα-O-Thr was first discovered in human urine but garnered little interest at the time. However, finding O-fucose directly linked to various clotting proteins and signaling receptors, such as Notch, sparked considerable interest. Monoclonal antibodies that detect glycans on specific proteins such as α-dystroglycan provided tools to identify other novel glycans. In addition, mass spectrometry revealed unusual protein modifications, such as mannose linked to protein as a C-glycoside. Table 13.1 describes many of the less common linkages synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi secretory pathway. Chapters 18 and 19 describe the very few known glycosylation linkages synthesized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Other classes of eukaryotic glycoprotein glycosylation  EGF repeats, also known as EGF domains, are small protein domains (∼40 amino acids) defined by six conserved Cys residues, which form three disulfide bonds (Figure 13.1A). They are found in a few hundred cell-surface and secreted proteins in metazoans and, depending on their sequence, may be modified with O-glycans as described in Table 13.1. Proteins with EGF repeats harboring these O-glycans include several involved in blood clot formation and dissolution, and the Notch family of receptors and canonical Notch ligands (Delta and Serrate/Jagged) involved in cell fate decisions. These glycan modifications are important because they regulate signal transduction during embryonic development and adult organ maintenance, cell differentiation, and the growth of several cancers. Moreover, mutations in several enzymes involved in the addition or elongation of these glycans have been found in human diseases (Chapter 45). Modifications of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats.

A schematic representation of an EGF repeat is shown: (yellow) conserved Cys residues; (gray lines between the cysteines) disulfide-bonding (more...) The signaling pathway best known to be regulated by O-glycans on EGF repeats is the Notch signaling pathway. Notch was originally identified in Drosophila, and homologs have been found in all metazoans, with four Notch receptors in mammals. Activation of Notch signal transduction is controlled at numerous levels, and dysregulation of Notch signaling results in a number of human diseases, including several types of cancer and a variety of developmental disorders. Two classes of canonical ligands bind to and activate Notch signaling in Drosophila: Delta and Serrate. Mammals have three Delta-like homologs (DLL1, DLL3, and DLL4), and two Serrate homologs called Jagged 1 and 2 (JAG1 and JAG2). These ligands are single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins that bind to and trans-activate Notch receptors on an adjacent cell. Binding of Notch and ligands in the same cell often results in cis-inhibition of the pathway. Work in recent years has shown that the O-glycans on Notch receptors affect both trans-activatory and cis-inhibitory interactions between Notch receptors and their ligands. The extracellular domain of Notch contains up to 36 tandem EGF repeats (Figure 13.2), many of which contain consensus sites for one or more types of O-glycan (Figure 13.1A). Notch EGF repeats can harbor O-fucose, O-GlcNAc and/or O-glucose (Figure 13.2). As discussed below, these sugar modifications regulate various aspects of Notch signal transduction, sometimes in a partially redundant manner and sometimes via distinct mechanisms.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) (more...) The α-linked O-fucose modification immediately precedes the third conserved Cys of certain EGF repeats (Figure 13.1A). The consensus motif for O-fucosylation is C2X4(S/T)C3 (C2 and C3 are the second and third conserved Cys of the EGF repeat). Nearly 100 proteins in mouse or human databases contain this sequence. O-Fucose can be elongated to a tetrasaccharide (Siaα2–3/6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Fucα-O-Ser/Thr) in certain contexts (e.g., EGF1 from human clotting factor IX and EGF12 from mouse NOTCH1) (Table 13.1), but not in others (e.g., EGF1 from human clotting factor VII and EGF5 from mouse NOTCH1). Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) transfers fucose from GDP-Fuc to a properly folded EGF repeat containing the appropriate consensus sequence (Figure 13.1B). O-Fucose can be elongated by a β1-3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3GlcNAcT) specific for O-fucose residues in a properly folded EGF repeat. The gene encoding the O-fucose-EGF β3GlcNAcT was originally identified in Drosophila as a modifier of Notch signaling called fringe. There are three mammalian homologs: Manic fringe (MFNG), Lunatic fringe (LFNG), and Radical fringe (RFNG).'

This chapter provides an overview of glycosylation from the perspective of a single cell, taking into account the patterns of expression, topology, and other features of the biosynthetic and degradative enzymes that are common to most cell types. The focus is mostly on the organization of glycosylation in eukaryotic cells. Chapters 21 and 22 further address prokaryotic glycosylation mechanisms. After more than three billion years of evolution, every free-living cell and every cell type within eukaryotic organisms remains covered with a dense and complex layer of glycans (Chapter 20). Even enveloped viruses that bud from infected cells carry with them the glycosylation patterns of the host. Additionally, most secreted molecules are glycosylated and extracellular matrices of multicellular organisms are rich in glycans and glycoconjugates. Matrices secreted by unicellular organisms when they congregate (e.g., bacterial biofilms [Chapter 21]) also contain glycans. Thus, evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu. Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms. They then make their way via an intermediate compartment (IC) through multiple stacks of the Golgi apparatus, finally being distributed to various destinations from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Secretory pathway proteins can be N-glycosylated, O-glycosylated, and/or modified with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, and some called proteoglycans are modified with attached glycosaminoglycan chains. The enzymes involved in each of these modification pathways are distinct. N-linked glycans and GPI anchors are preassembled before being transferred to proteins and then further modified in the ER–Golgi pathway. The stepwise assembly of O-linked glycans and glycosaminoglycans, as well as the glycosylation of lipids, involve reactions in both the ER and Golgi (Chapters 9–13 and 17). Figure 4.1 superficially depicts some steps in the synthesis of the major glycan classes in the ER–Golgi pathway of animal cells. Initiation and maturation of the major types of eukaryotic glycoconjugates in relation to subcellular trafficking in the ER–Golgi–plasma membrane pathway.'
 'The enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to EGF repeats (EOGT) is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is closely related to the enzymes that catalyze mucin-like glycosylation, but not the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT; catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc). Unlike intracellular O-GlcNAcylation, modification of EGF repeats by O-GlcNAc is static and can be extended by the addition of galactose. Recent studies show that O-GlcNAc is found on thousands of nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic proteins, including many heavily studied proteins such as RNA polymerase II, histones, and ribosomal proteins (Figure 19.2; Table 19.1). Yet, although phosphorylation was discovered in 1954, O-GlcNAc was not discovered until 1983. So why did O-GlcNAc remain undetected for so long? First, the long-standing dogma was that glycosylation (other than glycogen storage) did not occur with the nucleocytosolic compartment. Second, unlike charged modifications (e.g., phosphate), addition and removal of O-GlcNAc generally does not affect the migration of polypeptides on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). A small shift in protein migration might be seen if the O-GlcNAc residues are highly clustered or if the protein is extensively O-GlcNAcylated at multiple sites (e.g., p62 nuclear pore protein). Third, all cells contain high levels of hydrolases, including abundant lysosomal hexosaminidases and nucleocytoplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, that rapidly remove O-GlcNAc from intracellular proteins when the cell is damaged or lysed. Thus, O-GlcNAc is often lost during the isolation of a protein. Finally, O-GlcNAc is particularly difficult to detect by physical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, because it often occurs at substoichiometric amounts on a protein and is readily lost during the ionization process in a mass spectrometer. In both electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses of a mixture of unmodified and O-GlcNAc-modified peptides, not only is the O-GlcNAc lost during ionization but the signal from the O-GlcNAc-modified peptides that remain is suppressed by the presence of the unmodified peptide. Our ability to detect O-GlcNAc has been improved in recent years by the development of monoclonal antibodies, lectins and mutant glycoside hydrolases that bind O-GlcNAc, the use of “click chemistry” compatible sugars (Chapters 51 and 56), and the invention of more sophisticated mass spectrometric techniques, such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry. In mammals, the dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc on proteins is regulated by the concerted actions of enzymes encoded by just two genes: OGT and a neutral β-hexosaminidase known as O-GlcNAcase (OGA) (Figure 19.1). The regulation of the transcription start site and alternative splicing results in the synthesis of at least three isoforms of OGT and two isoforms of OGA. Nonetheless, the question remains: “How can so few enzymes specifically glycosylate and deglycosylate so many substrates?” Although both OGT and OGA each have only a single catalytic subunit, they actually exist within the cell as a multitude of different holoenzymes in which their catalytic subunits are noncovalently bound to a myriad of accessory proteins that appear to control their targeting (Figure 19.3). In addition, both OGT and OGA are modified by both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation. Functions for some of these posttranslational modifications have been identified, including substrate targeting, altering protein localization, and altering specific activity.'
 'Because prokaryotic cells do not have an ER–Golgi pathway, they typically generate their cell-surface glycans at the interface of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm or in the periplasm (see below). Other glycoconjugates like hyaluronan in vertebrate cells, chitin in invertebrate cells, and cellulose in plant cells are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and simultaneously extruded across the membrane to the outside (Chapters 16, 24, and 26). The enzymes involved in the synthesis of these glycoconjugates appear to mediate this extrusion. Typical eukaryotic Golgi glycosylation enzymes have also been found at the cell surface or as soluble forms in the extracellular space, as described below. Whether these glycosyltransferases would routinely have adequate supplies of nucleotide sugar donors to modify cell-surface glycans is unclear, but at least one example has been documented (see below). On the other hand, there are examples of remodeling of cell-surface glycans in animal cells—for example, the endosulfatases (Sulf enzymes) that modify heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Chapter 17) and endogenous sialidases that remove cell-surface sialic acids (Chapter 15). Some protozoan parasites, such as trypanosomes, transfer sialic acids from host glycoconjugates to their cell-surface glycans using trans-sialidases (Chapter 43). Prokaryotic assembly pathways of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are very similar to pathways found in the ER and the plasma membrane of eukaryotes. They are assembled in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the plasma membrane. For many biosynthetic pathways, such as O-antigen biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, N-linked protein glycosylation in Archaea, and some Gram-negative bacteria or S-layer biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria, oligosaccharides are assembled on lipid carriers at the inner site of the plasma membrane and then flipped to the periplasmic site (Chapters 21 and 22). Synthesis of oligosaccharides can continue in the periplasm, but for these reactions, isoprenoid-linked monosaccharides serve as activated substrates as is the case in cell wall biogenesis of actinobacteria (mycobacteria) (Chapter 21). Much effort has gone into understanding the mechanisms of glycosylation and glycan modification within the ER and the Golgi apparatus, and it is clear that a variety of interacting and competing factors determine the final outcome of the reactions. The glycosyltransferases and processing glycosidases are well-studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. Despite lack of sequence homology among different glycosyltransferase families, most Golgi enzymes share some features. Early studies of vertebrate glycosyltransferases found some of these activities in soluble form in secretions and body fluids; others were identified as membrane-bound activities within cells, and some showed both properties. Subsequent molecular cloning defined the sequences of Golgi glycosyltransferases, revealing that they share a common topology and domain structure that can account for these observations. The majority of Golgi glycosylation enzymes are type II membrane proteins consisting of three parts: an amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, followed by a transmembrane (TM) region that also acts as an uncleavable signal sequence, and a large carboxy-terminal region containing a membrane-proximal, proteolytically sensitive stem region as well as a large catalytic domain. The type II topology of these Golgi enzymes places their catalytic sequences in the Golgi lumen, where they participate in the synthesis of the glycan chains on proteins and lipids during their transit through the secretory pathway (Figure 4.2).

Golgi glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are type II membrane proteins with their catalytic sequences facing the lumen of the Golgi.']","In glycoproteins, the linkage between the first sugar of a glycan and the protein defines its glycosylation class, including common GlcNAc-N-Asn, GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr, and Xyl-O-Ser linkages present in glycoproteins and proteoglycans.

Interestingly, plant lectins were used historically to aid in typing blood. For example, the lectin from Dolichos biflorus agglutinates erythrocytes from most blood group A individuals (termed A1 individuals), but it does not agglutinate erythrocytes from individuals of the A2 subgroup, and it is still used currently to distinguish individuals with these two different blood types. The A1 and A2 subgroup antigens are distinct (Figure 14.5) reflecting the different A transferases encoded by the A1 versus A2 allele at the ABO locus. Heritable erythrocyte antigenic polymorphisms determined by the ABO locus have important medical implications. Early in the postnatal period, the immune system generates IgM antibodies against ABO antigen(s), even though they are absent from erythrocytes. This is because glycan antigens similar or identical to the A and B blood group determinants are carried by colonizing bacteria and fungi. Thus, type-O individuals do not synthesize A or B determinants but show relatively high titers of circulating IgM antibodies (termed isoagglutinins) against A and B blood group determinants. Similarly, blood group B individuals show circulating IgM anti-A isoagglutinins, but they do not make isoagglutinins against the blood group B determinant, a “self” antigen. Conversely, serum from blood group A individuals contains anti-B but not anti-A antibodies. Finally, people with the AB blood group do not make either anti-A or anti-B IgM isoagglutinins, because both are “self” antigens. Anti-H(O) antibodies are not made in most people because a substantial fraction are converted to A or B determinants or they are a “self” antigen. IgM isoagglutinins efficiently trigger the complement cascade and circulate in human plasma at titers sufficient to cause complement-dependent lysis of transfused erythrocytes that display the corresponding blood group antigens. Such rapid erythrocyte lysis causes an immediate, acute transfusion reaction, which can lead to hypotension, shock, acute renal failure, and death from circulatory collapse. This problem is avoided by ensuring that the ABO type of transfused erythrocytes is compatible with the recipient's ABO type. Thus, an A recipient may receive erythrocytes from A or O persons but not from a person of type B or AB. Blood banks perform typing and cross-matching assays. First, units of erythrocyte products typed for the A and B antigens are chosen to match the patient's ABO type. To ensure that these are truly “compatible,” the patient's serum is cross-matched by mixing with a small aliquot of each prospective erythrocyte unit. Erythrocytes of compatible units do not agglutinate (form an erythrocyte clump), whereas incompatibility is indicated by agglutinated erythrocytes formed by antibodies in the patient's serum. Blood typing is used to ensure compatibility not only for red blood cell transfusions but also for transfusion with platelets and plasma. Similar ABO compatibility concerns are important in heart, kidney, liver, and bone marrow transplantation procedures. The “type and cross” procedures have virtually eliminated ABO blood group transfusion reactions in the developed world. Attempts are being made to enzymatically modify A or B erythrocytes using glycosidases to remove GalNAc (A) and/or Gal (B), in order to convert them to “O”, the “universal donor” type. The few individuals with AB type are “universal acceptors.” In addition to accurately typing AB blood types, A1 and A2 blood group distinctions are important clinically as A2 individuals can generate anti-A1 antibodies, although these antibodies are often not clinically meaningful.""

The few individuals with AB type are “universal acceptors.” In addition to accurately typing AB blood types, A1 and A2 blood group distinctions are important clinically as A2 individuals can generate anti-A1 antibodies, although these antibodies are often not clinically meaningful. Furthermore, when crossing ABO(H) barriers during solid organ transplantation, A2 donor organs have better overall survival when compared to A1 following transplantation into a blood group O or B recipient; this is presumably because of the lower expression of the A antigen in A2 individuals. In addition to transfusion and transplantation, ABO(H) alloantigens are some of the most frequent allogeneic barriers crossed during fetal development. IgG anti-A,B antibodies present in blood group O mothers, which react with the A and B antigen, can cross the placenta and engage A or B antigens on the surface of fetal red blood cells (RBCs). However, unlike IgG antibodies against other alloantigens, such as RhD, IgG anti-A,B antibodies rarely cause life-threatening anemia in a fetus or neonate, presumably because of the relatively low level of A and B antigen expression present on fetal RBCs. However, despite the lower level of A and B expression on fetal RBCs, anti-A and anti-B antibodies present in maternal circulation can rapidly remove A or B positive fetal RBCs following exposure during parturition, reducing the probability of alloimmunization to other alloantigens. This was the first example of antibody-mediated immunosuppression clinically and formed the basis of highly successful anti-RhD formularies designed to prevent Rh alloimmunization and therefore hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Cross-matching procedures helped to identify a rare ABO blood group phenotype termed the Bombay phenotype, so named because the first identified individual lived in that city (now Mumbai). Affected persons have erythrocytes and tissue cells lacking A, B, and H determinants because they have inactive FUT1 and FUT2 genes, and therefore no α1-2FucT enzyme. Bombay sera contain IgM antibodies that react with erythrocytes from virtually all donors, including O erythrocytes (H antigen-positive, A and B antigen-negative). They show robust titers of anti-H, anti-A, and anti-B IgM antibodies and cannot receive erythrocytes from any donor except those of the same Bombay blood type. A related phenotype, termed para-Bombay, occurs in people with an inactive FUT1 gene, but at least one functional Se (FUT2) allele (secretor-positive). The fact that Bombay individuals appear generally healthy implies that developmental or physiological functions for the A, B, and H antigens, if they ever existed, are no longer relevant. However, a variety of associations have been made between the ABO blood group phenotype and relative risk for infection by some pathogens and the acquisition of a spectrum of diseases. For example, people with blood group O who are also Lewis-antigen positive (see below) are the most susceptible to infection by Helicobacter pylori. This is because H. pylori binds well to glycans with terminal Fuc, such as the H and Lewis antigens. The AB blood group is associated with infection by Brucella (Brucellosis) and noroviruses that cause gastroenteritis, while blood group O individuals appear to be at an increased risk for cholera. Levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) correlate with ABO(H) blood group inheritance, with blood group A individuals on average having the highest VWF levels. Differences in VWF among individuals of different blood group status may in part account for associations observed between blood group A individuals and the likelihood of thromboembolic events and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Blood group status has also been associated with risk of stomach and pancreatic cancers. ABO status may also be protective. Thus, enveloped viruses carry the ABO(H) glycans of their hosts and are susceptible to lysis following infection of another individual with an ABO-incompatible type. Finally, differences in susceptibility to severe complications of malaria appear to be affected by ABO blood groups.'
 'Normally, colonic mucosal proteins display heavily O-acetylated sialic acids, but these acetyl groups are diminished in ulcerative colitis. Whether this contributes to the pathology is unknown, but O-acetylated sialic acids are more resistant to bacterial sialidases (Chapter 15). Decreased sialic acid O-acetylation is also a feature of colon carcinomas. Heparin (a highly sulfated form of HS; Chapter 17) is a therapeutic agent extracted from porcine intestines or bovine lungs. It is a fast-acting and potent anticoagulant often used to avoid thrombosis, in procedures including dialysis and open-heart surgery. Its effectiveness relies on a specific sulfated heparin pentasaccharide that binds circulating antithrombin III and markedly enhances its ability to inactivate coagulation Factors Xa and IIa (thrombin) (Chapter 17). Animal-derived “unfractionated heparin” is now often replaced with low-molecular-weight heparins because they have fewer complications. One explanation is that the unfractionated heparin effects on thrombin require a long chain that interacts both with the antithrombin and with thrombin itself in a tripartite complex. In contrast, the shorter chains found in low-molecular-weight heparins only facilitate antithrombin inactivation of Factor Xa. Thus, low-molecular-weight heparins affect Xa but not thrombin activity. A synthetic pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) that binds and facilitates antithrombin inactivation of Factor Xa is an alternative to heparin. Although these improvements are valuable, unfractionated heparin has a variety of other biological effects besides anticoagulation. Thus, other beneficial effects of heparin, such as the blocking of P- and L-selectin, are reduced or even eliminated by the switch to low-molecular-weight heparins and the synthetic pentasaccharide. An uncommon but feared complication of heparin treatment is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). During HIT, complexes between heparin and platelet factor-4 form, and the de novo formed pathogenic antibodies against these complexes deposit on platelets, causing their aggregation and loss from circulation. Paradoxically, this process results in exaggerated thrombosis, rather than bleeding. The incidence of this complication is lower with low-molecular-weight heparins and significantly curtailed with the use of the pure pentasaccharide. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin that leads to various acute and chronic painful complications. Symptoms were thought to be caused by vaso-occlusion due to abnormally shaped and/or membrane-modified hypoxic erythrocytes. Now, it is clear that abnormal adhesion of multiple cell types is responsible, and that this is partially mediated by selectins. Blocking selectin action with analogs of natural ligands such as sLex or heparin can restore blood flow in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. A pan-selectin inhibitor (GMI-1070, “rivipansel”) has undergone clinical trials for reduction of severity and duration of sickle cell crisis. Notably, glycopeptide mimetics of PSGL-1 and antibodies that block PSGL-1-P-selectin interactions (e.g., FDA-approved crizanlizumab) can mitigate sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises. Blood transfusion medicine first identified the ABO blood group system, defined by differential expression of α-GalNAc and α-Gal transferases across populations (Chapter 14). These and other less prominent glycan antigens can cause hemolytic transfusion and rejection reactions, mostly because of errors in blood typing. Although anti-A and anti-B titers likely influence transfusion and transplantation outcomes, simple assessment of antibody levels fails to fully account for the clinical impact(s) of an ABO(H) incompatible transfusion. Efforts to generate “universal donor” red blood cells, via enzymatic conversion of blood group A and B antigens to the O state using bacterial enzymes, are underway.'
 'Synthesis of H (O), A, and B blood group determinants. For details, see text. LN designates N-acetyllactosamine unit.  A or B blood group determinants are subsequently formed from H Type-1, -2, -3, or -4 determinants by glycosyltransferases encoded by the ABO locus. The A allele encodes the α1-3GalNAcT (A3GALNT) that generates the A glycan epitope forming the A blood group (Figure 14.5). The B allele of the ABO locus encodes the α1-3GalT (A3GALT1) that forms the B glycan determinant and generates the B blood group (Figure 14.5). O alleles at the ABO locus encode a functionally inactive A/B glycosyltransferase. Individuals who synthesize exclusively A determinants are blood group A and have the genotype AA or AO, blood group B individuals are BB or BO, and individuals that express one A and one B allele have the genotype AB. Blood group O individuals expressing inactive A/B glycosyltransferase have the genotype OO. They express only the H antigen. Blood type designations are the same as the blood group genotypes above. In terms of nomenclature, the O blood group includes the H antigen and occasionally the term ABO(H) is used. Additional variants of α1-3GalNAcT and α1-3GalT exist that are enzymatically active, but at a much lower level. These variants are largely responsible for individuals who are initially typed as blood group O, but actually express very low levels of the A or B blood group antigen. The ABO antigens are expressed on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of erythrocytes and many epithelial or endothelial cells in tissues. Some tissues also synthesize soluble forms on secreted glycoproteins, glycolipids, and free glycans. As discussed below, the ability to secrete soluble molecules carrying ABO(H) blood group antigens is a genetically determined function of alleles at the Se (FUT2) locus. On each human red blood cell, ∼80% of the 1–2 million ABO(H) determinants are attached to the anion transport protein Band 3, and ∼15% are carried by the erythrocyte glucose transport protein Band 4.5. Both of these integral membrane proteins carry ABO(H) antigens on a single, branched N-glycan with poly-LacNAc. Each erythrocyte has other glycoproteins and approximately half a million glycolipids with ABO(H) determinants. Many of these glycolipids have A, B, and H determinants on poly-LacNAc chains and have been termed polyglycosylceramides or macroglycolipids. A, B, and H determinants based on Type-4 chains (Figure 14.4) are also present in human erythrocyte glycolipids. A, B, and H determinants of the epidermis are primarily on Type-2 units, whereas mucins of the gastric mucosa and in ovarian cyst fluid carry A, B, and H antigens on Type-3 units (Figure 14.4). Epithelial cells lining the digestive, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts, and epithelia of some salivary and exocrine glands, synthesize soluble forms of the ABO(H) determinants, largely carried on Type-1 units (Figure 14.4). Expression of the A, B, and H determinants in secretory tissues is a function of the α1-2FucT encoded by the Se gene (FUT2), because the H gene (FUT1) is not expressed there. Humans with an inactive FUT2 gene do not express soluble forms of the A, B, or H determinants in saliva or milk oligosaccharides or in other tissues and are termed “nonsecretors.” Serology is used to characterize erythrocytes for transfusion and has identified variants of the A and B blood group determinants that typically yield weak reactivity with blood typing reagents. Interestingly, plant lectins were used historically to aid in typing blood.'
 'The resulting glycomimetic had E-selectin binding affinity comparable to sialyl-Lewis x. Glycomimetic E-selectin inhibitors based on sialyl-Lewis x.  GMI-1070, targeting E-, P-, and L-selectin, yielded unconvincing results in Phase 3 clinical trials as a treatment for sickle cell crisis and is under further investigation. A variety of glycans, including the classical A and B blood group determinants, can act as barriers to blood transfusion and transplantation of organs (Chapters 13 and 46). Rejection of mismatched blood or organs occurs because hosts have a high titer of preexisting antibodies against the glycan epitopes, presumably as a prior reaction to related structures found on bacteria or other microbes. In the case of the ABO blood groups, incompatibility is routinely managed by blood and tissue typing and finding an appropriate donor for the recipient. Bacterial enzymes can be used in vitro to remove the A and B blood group determinants from A and B red cells, converting them into “universal donor” O red cells. A related problem is found in xenotransplantation (i.e., the transplantation of organs between species), which is actively being pursued as a solution for the shortage of human organs for patients. The animal donors of preference are pigs, because many porcine organs resemble those of humans in size, physiology, and anatomy. However, unlike humans and certain other primates, pigs and most other mammals produce the terminal “α-Gal” epitope on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Because humans have naturally occurring high-titer antibodies in blood directed toward this epitope, this results in hyperacute rejection of porcine organ transplants, via reaction of the antibodies with endothelial cells of blood vessels. Attempts to prevent this reaction, include blood filtration over glycan affinity columns to remove xenoreactive antibodies and blockade of the interaction by infusing soluble competing oligosaccharides. Transgenic pigs lacking the reactive epitope have also been produced, as have animals with an excess of complement-controlling proteins on their cell surfaces. Pig organs also have high levels of the nonhuman sialic acid (Neu5Gc), against which most humans have antibodies. Even if this problem is solved, there are other glycan and protein structural differences between humans and pigs that cause later stages of graft rejection, thus necessitating immunosuppression. The authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Morten Thaysen-Andersen.']","Incompatibility is indicated by agglutinated erythrocytes formed by antibodies in the patient's serum.

A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.15 Amanda L. Lewis, Xi Chen, Ronald L. Schnaar, and Ajit Varki. Sialic acids (Sias) are abundant on vertebrate glycoproteins, glycolipids, and milk oligosaccharides, as well as on some microbial surface glycans, mediating diverse functional roles. Originally discovered within the Deuterostome lineage of animals and associated microbes, they are actually a subset of a more ancient family of α-keto acid monosaccharides with a 9-carbon backbone called nonulosonic acids (NulOs), which are also found in some Eubacteria and Archaea. Biosynthesis of all NulO-glycans requires the activation of NulO to a CMP-sugar, before the NulO is transferred to glycan acceptors. NulOs are remarkable for the number and the type of functional groups on one monosaccharide. Further complexity arises from various epimers, modifications, and diverse linkages to other glycans, making these molecules well-suited to carry information for glycan–protein, cell–cell, and pathogen–host recognition. NulOs are among the most rapidly evolving classes of monosaccharides in nature and exist in tremendous variety, particularly in the microbial world. Given their high density and widespread location on vertebrate cells, Sias also exert many functions via electronegative charge, such as repulsion of cell–cell interactions, protein stabilization, ion binding, and ion transport. Early nomenclature of these molecules was tied to their discovery, being first isolated by Gunnar Blix from salivary mucins in 1936 and independently by Ernst Klenk from brain glycolipids in 1941. Blix named his substance “sialic acid” after the Greek word for saliva (σíαλoν), and Klenk named his “neuraminic acid” for neurons in the brain. By the time the relationship of these substances became evident, both names were already in use and have persisted. Although 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sometimes called “NANA”) is the most common sialic acid (Sia) in humans, the Sia family is comprised of related structures (Figure 15.1) that vary at the C-5 carbon, including 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (also known as 3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid, or Kdn) with a hydroxyl group at C-5. Similar 9-carbon backbone 2-keto acid monosaccharides were later discovered in some bacterial lipopolysaccharides and initially called “bacterial sialic acids.” The resulting confusion was resolved by suggesting that the term “sialic acid” (Sia) be limited to its original use in describing neuraminic acid (Neu), Kdn, and their derivatives in deuterostomes and their pathogens, and that the term “nonulosonic acid” (NulO) be used to encompass the entire group of 9-carbon backbone non-2-ulosonic acids (Figure 15.1). Base structures representing the larger family of NulO molecules are shown in Figure 15.1 for comparison. This chapter will largely deal with the biology, metabolism, and functions of Sias in mammals. The evolution, distribution, and functions of the larger family of NulOs are briefly described toward the end of this chapter. Sialic acids (Sias) and other nonulosonic acids (NulOs). As shown in the figure, Sias are a subset of NulOs.'
 'Use of α2-3 or α2-8-specific sialidases can provide some insight on Sia linkages as well. Sia-glycosides are also more susceptible to acid hydrolysis than most other sugars, being released using 0.1 m HCl or even with weak acids like 2 m acetic acid or propionic acid at 80°C (albeit still with some loss or migration of labile modifications). This allows selective release of Sias from complex glycans for subsequent analysis by chromatographic methods. Free Sias react with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) to generate fluorescent compounds amenable to qualitative and quantitative high-pressure liquid chromatography. There are still some major limitations to methods available for Sia analysis. For example, some mass spectrometric methods result in selective loss of Sias before mass detection. Some Sia-linkages are partly or completely resistant to sialidases and some are even relatively resistant to acid release. In terms of identifying Sia modifications, the most accurate analysis requires complete release and purification with the modifications intact. The stability of each modification to analytical conditions must be considered—for example, O-acetyl groups are labile to common methods that use alkaline conditions (permethylation and beta-elimination). Sia-binding lectins are also useful for detecting sialoglycans and their linkages in situ and on isolated sialoglycans. Sambucus nigra (elderberry) lectin binds selectively to α2-6-linked Sias and Maackia amurensis lectins bind selectively to α2-3-linked Sias. Because plants do not express Sias, these lectins may perhaps deter animal ingestion. Alternatively, the natural ligands of these lectins may not be Sias. Improved probes are now being developed, taking advantage of the fact that many microbes have spent millions of years optimizing their binding to vertebrate sialomes (e.g., the B subunits of various toxins). An interesting tool for detecting a specific Sia modification is the hemagglutinin of influenza C or bovine coronavirus, which bind specifically to 9-O-acetyl Sias on isolated sialoglycans, cells, and tissues, if the esterase function is inactivated. Sias are endowed with a rich diversity of chemical modalities within a single monosaccharide, which evolution uses to modulate the biophysical environment, to mask underlying glycans, and for specific recognition by complementary Sia-binding proteins that mediate biological processes. These functions are not mutually exclusive—for example, highly sialylated molecules with major biophysical roles (such as mucins) may also express specific sialoglycans that serve as ligands in recognition processes. For simplicity, different roles of Sias are addressed separately below. Mucins are heavily glycosylated O-GalNAc-modified sialoglycoproteins secreted or membrane-bound at epithelial surfaces in airways and in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of animals (Chapter 10). Mucins can be remarkably large (several in the range of 5 to >20 MDa). Their dense anionic charge and their propensity to bind water make them efficient as a hydrating and protective barrier at tissue surfaces in contact with the environment. On mucins, as well as other glycoproteins, closely spaced O-GalNAc-linked sialoglycans generate extended polypeptide configurations that would collapse without glycosylation. Clustered sialoglycans along the polypeptide chain can also protect the underlying protein from proteases. Membrane-bound sialoglycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are often quite dense, provide cell surface anionic charge that acts as a barrier and regulates cell surface functions. An extreme example of these biophysical effects is polySia, whose functional impacts are detailed above. Given Sia abundance on cell surfaces (see Figure 15.3), it is not surprising that numerous animal pathogens evolved to target these molecules. Indeed, highly specific Sia-binding proteins were first discovered on human pathogens and their toxins. In the search for host cell receptors for influenza viruses, it was discovered that isolated viruses cross-linked red blood cells, resulting in hemagglutination.'
 ""A useful conceptualization of the sialome is as a “forest canopy” of the cell-surface glycan “forest” (the whole glycome) (Figure 15.3). At the outermost level are different Sia structures (leaves and flowers), which are in glycosidic linkage to underlying linear and branched oligosaccharides (stems and branches) (see Figures 15.2 and 15.3), which in turn are components of glycoproteins and glycolipids (the tree trunks). At the cell surface, glycolipids and glycoproteins organize into lateral domains (forests). Just as the forest varies greatly from place to place, the sialome varies among cell types and among domains on a given cell surface, variations that serve specific functions. As with the glycome, each cell type in each species expresses its own distinct sialome. For example, although mammalian liver sialoglycans are most abundant on glycoproteins, brain sialoglycans are much more abundant as sialoglycolipids (Chapter 11), so much so that they are termed “gangliosides” for the nerve ganglia on which they were discovered. The sialome also varies markedly in response to environmental cues. Sias can also exist as internally linked structures rather than on termini of glycans. In vertebrates, the terminal Sia of a glycan chain is rarely extended further, except with another Sia (Figure 15.3). Among bacteria, Sias and the related NulOs can also be found in diverse cellular structures, including capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharide O-antigens or as part of flagella, pili, or structures such as the cell wall or S-layer (Chapter 21). Bacteria with close relationships to vertebrate hosts often mimic the terminal placement of Sias on capsules and O-antigens. However, many NulOs of bacteria, including Sias, can occur as internal glycan components within repeating units of polysaccharides, which have also been reported in some invertebrates such as echinoderms. In the latter, the C-4 hydroxyl of Neu5Ac is sometimes glycosylated with other monosaccharides such as fucose, galactose, and glucose. Overall, it appears that we do not yet know the full extent of sialoglycan diversity in nature. Polysialic acid (polySia, previously called PSA) is a linear homopolymer of Sias that sometimes reaches lengths of more than 100 residues. Shorter chains of two to three residues, called oligosialic acids, are common components of gangliosides (Figure 15.3 and Chapter 11) and are found occasionally as terminal structures on glycoprotein glycans. PolySia is a prominent structural feature of a highly select group of acceptor proteins, the best studied of which is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Beginning early in vertebrate brain development, long polySia chains (Neu5Acα2-8)n are added to NCAM (often then called PSA-NCAM), on the termini of two specific N-glycans. The large hydration shell formed by polySia markedly increases the hydrodynamic volume of its protein carrier and interferes with NCAM's natural cell–cell adhesion function. PolySia thus converts an adhesive protein into a repelling one. During brain development, a high level of polySia likely ensures that neural precursors can migrate to their final anatomical sites. Once a destination is reached, polySia is down-regulated and firm adhesion proceeds, keeping the cells in place. When the sialyltransferases (STs) responsible for polySia formation are genetically ablated in mice, some nerve progenitor cells adhere prematurely, become stuck in place and fail to reach their proper destination. In contrast to the above-mentioned “repulsive field effects,” polySia can also act an “attractive field,” binding and locally concentrating neurotrophic factors like BDNF and FGF2. Notably, human genetic and molecular evidence indicate that variations in polysialylation may be a factor in human psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia.""
 'An extreme example of these biophysical effects is polySia, whose functional impacts are detailed above. Given Sia abundance on cell surfaces (see Figure 15.3), it is not surprising that numerous animal pathogens evolved to target these molecules. Indeed, highly specific Sia-binding proteins were first discovered on human pathogens and their toxins. In the search for host cell receptors for influenza viruses, it was discovered that isolated viruses cross-linked red blood cells, resulting in hemagglutination. Over time, the red cells dispersed and could no longer be agglutinated by fresh viruses. This led to the concept of a viral “hemagglutinin” (a term still used in virus typing; e.g., the “H” in H1N1) that binds to a receptor on the red blood cell, which is also susceptible to a “receptor destroying enzyme” from the virus. The component released by receptor-destroying enzyme was identified as Sia, the hemagglutinin as a Sia-binding protein, and the receptor-destroying enzyme as a sialidase (viral neuraminidase, the “N” in H1N1). Interestingly, the Sia-linkage specificity of the hemagglutinin defines host restrictions; with bird influenza virus preferentially binding to Sias in α2-3-linkage and human virus to Sias in α2-6-linkage. Scientists monitoring influenza virus outbreaks test α2-3- versus α2-6-specificity to detect potential emerging human influenza strains. Molecules designed to block the viral sialidases are useful anti-influenza drugs (Chapter 57). Sia-specific binding proteins are widespread in pathogens and include numerous viral hemagglutinins, bacterial adhesins, bacterial toxins, and parasite-binding proteins (see Table 15.1 for a few examples). Helicobacter pylori causes stomach ulcers and cancers. It expresses a Sia-specific adhesin called SabA, which contributes to its chronic colonization of the stomach lining. The merozoite stage of the malarial parasite P. falciparum can bind to erythrocyte sialoglycans to initiate cell entry. Several bacterial toxins also target sialoglycans. Cholera toxin and the structurally related E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin both bind to Sias on ganglioside GM1 on the intestinal epithelium, whereas tetanus and related botulinum toxins bind to more complex gangliosides (Chapter 37). The toxin from the human pathogen Salmonella Typhi binds specifically to Neu5Ac on glycans but not Neu5Gc; influenza C virus expresses a hemagglutinin that binds only to 9-O-acetylated Sias. The complexities of Sia diversification are thought to be the outcome of an ongoing evolutionary “arms race” between animals and microbial pathogens (Chapter 20). In this regard, it is notable that O-acetyl and N-glycolyl groups on Sias can limit action of bacterial sialidases and block the binding of some pathogens. Alternately, the same modifications may facilitate binding of pathogens that have adapted to them. Sialoglycans at environmental surfaces (like mucins) or free in biological fluids might provide protection by virtue of their “decoy” inhibition of microbial adherence and/or sialidases. The evolutionary persistence of sialoglycans despite their role in virulent diseases suggests critical physiological roles, some of which are addressed below. A few classic examples of sialic acid–binding proteins in nature  Sias in vertebrates can act as “biological masks,” preventing recognition of underlying glycans (especially β-linked Gal residues) by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins. They are also essential components of recognition molecules, with roles that vary according to cell type, tissue type, and species. The first mammalian Sia-binding protein found was the complement regulatory molecule factor H, a soluble serum factor that binds cell-surface Sias and protects cells from autoimmune attack, providing recognition of “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), which are also recognized by CD33-related Siglecs (Chapter 35). Human mutations in the Sia-binding site of factor H result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, a disease caused by excessive complement activation, because of the failure of factor H function.'
 'The 3D structures of pathogen sialidases are used for drug development (Chapter 42). Sialidases vary in their substrate specificity from highly selective (e.g., the α2-3-specific sialidase SpNanB and SpNanC from Streptococcus pneumoniae) to broadly acting (e.g., the α2-3, α2-6, α2-8 sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and SpNanA from S. pneumoniae). The products of sialidases also differ with free Sias as the most common ones (e.g., released by SpNanA) whereas 2,7-anhydro-Sias (e.g., released by SpNanB) and 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-sialic acids (Sia2ens) (e.g., released by SpNanC) are less common. Interestingly, some pathogen sialidases have additional lectin (sugar-binding) domains that appear to direct the action of the enzymes to particular sites. Some Sia linkages resist release even by sialidases with broad specificity. A branched α2-3Sia on the brain ganglioside GM2 requires a special helper protein (GM2-activator) to facilitate its cleavage, and mutation of GM2-activator protein results in GM2 buildup in the brain (Chapter 44). O-Methylation and O-acetylation of Sias also can hinder or even prevent hydrolysis by sialidases, as is the case for 4-O-acetyl group. These properties are likely biologically significant, but have not been well investigated. Microbial sialidases and trans-sialidases (see also Chapter 43) can be powerful virulence factors that may promote cellular invasion, unmask potential binding sites, and modulate the immune system. Sias liberated by sialidases at mucosal sites also provide nutrients for some bacteria or provide access to underlying carbohydrates. Viral neuraminidases facilitate release and spreading of newly formed viruses, and specific viral neuraminidase inhibitors are widely used as the antiviral drugs such as anti-influenza A virus drugs Relenza and Tamiflu (Chapter 42). Once a free Sia molecule is released in the lysosome of a vertebrate cell, it is returned to the cytosol by a specific exporter (SLC17A5, also called Sialin), in which it is either reused or degraded. Human mutations in Sialin cause Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disease, resulting in accumulation of Sia in lysosomes and excretion of excess Sia in the urine. Some pathogens scavenge Sias from the extracellular space, using high-efficiency transporters to concentrate them from trace levels. In contrast, there is no evidence for plasma membrane Sia transporters in eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, free Sias can be taken up into mammalian cells via fluid-phase macropinocytosis, eventually arriving in the lysosomes, from which they are exported into the cytoplasm by Sialin. Intact sialoglycans can also be taken up and transported to lysosomes, where sialidases release Sias for delivery to the cytoplasm and then to the nucleus to be reused by the cellular CMP-Sia synthetase. However, at the whole-body level, free Sias in the bloodstream derived from cellular sources or digestive processes are rapidly excreted in the urine. Thus, uptake of sialoglycoproteins (followed by lysosomal release by NEU1 and export by Sialin) may better account for the incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc in human tissues. In vertebrates, O-acetylated Sias are de-O-acetylated by Sia-specific O-acetylesterases, including the human enzyme coded by the SIAE gene, which may regulate B-cell development and immune tolerance by modulating recognition by Siglecs (Chapter 35). Enzymes with Sia 9-O-acetylesterase activity are also found in some bacteria and viruses.']","Sialic acids (Sias) are abundant on vertebrate glycoproteins, glycolipids, and milk oligosaccharides, as well as on some microbial surface glycans, mediating diverse functional roles.

Given their high density and widespread location on vertebrate cells, Sias also exert many functions via electronegative charge, such as repulsion of cell–cell interactions, protein stabilization, ion binding, and ion transport. Early nomenclature of these molecules was tied to their discovery, being first isolated by Gunnar Blix from salivary mucins in 1936 and independently by Ernst Klenk from brain glycolipids in 1941. Blix named his substance “sialic acid” after the Greek word for saliva (σíαλoν), and Klenk named his “neuraminic acid” for neurons in the brain. By the time the relationship of these substances became evident, both names were already in use and have persisted.","Although 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sometimes called “NANA”) is the most common sialic acid (Sia) in humans, the Sia family is comprised of related structures (Figure 15.1) that vary at the C-5 carbon, including 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (also known as 3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid, or Kdn) with a hydroxyl group at C-5. Similar 9-carbon backbone 2-keto acid monosaccharides were later discovered in some bacterial lipopolysaccharides and initially called “bacterial sialic acids.” The resulting confusion was resolved by suggesting that the term “sialic acid” (Sia) be limited to its original use in describing neuraminic acid (Neu), Kdn, and their derivatives in deuterostomes and their pathogens, and that the term “nonulosonic acid” (NulO) be used to encompass the entire group of 9-carbon backbone non-2-ulosonic acids (Figure 15.1).",0.9722222222222222,0.6873441185262159,0.7954077559025967,0.007936507936507936,0.99999999998,0.6666666666666666
"Complete the following paragraph: Large hyaluronan polymers in the extracellular space can be internalized following interaction with cell-surface receptors that trigger endocytosis, which may be facilitated by the membrane-associated hyaluronidases, HYAL2 and/or TMEM2, or through association with CEMIP.","['The Streptococcus hasA gene encodes a bifunctional protein that contains both transferase activities and assembles the polysaccharide from the reducing end. The synthase spans the membrane multiple times, presumably forming a pore for hyaluronan extrusion during capsule formation. In contrast, Pasteurella synthesizes hyaluronan by an enzyme that is unrelated to hasA and the mammalian Has gene family. In this case, the enzyme has two separable domains with independent glycosyltransferase activities—one for UDP-GlcNAc and the other for UDP-GlcA, and the elongation is on the nonreducing end. Animal cells express a set of catabolic enzymes that degrade hyaluronan. The human hyaluronidase gene (HYAL) family is complex, with two sets of three contiguous genes located on two chromosomes, a pattern that suggests two ancient gene duplications followed by a block duplication. In humans, the cluster on chromosome 3p21.3 (HYAL1, 2, and 3) appears to have major roles in somatic tissues. HYAL4 in the cluster on chromosome 7q31.3 codes for a protein that appears to have chondroitinase, but not hyaluronidase, activity; PHYAL1 is a pseudogene; and SPAM1 (sperm adhesion molecule 1, PH-20) is restricted to testes. The role of SPAM1 in fertilization is discussed below. Two additional enzymes with hyaluronan depolymerizing activity at neutral pH have been subsequently identified in multiple tissues and termed TMEM2 (transmembrane protein 2) and KIAA1199 (CEMIP, cell migration–inducing protein). The turnover of hyaluronan in most tissues is rapid (e.g., a half-life of ∼1 day in epidermal tissues), but its residence time in some tissues can be quite long and dependent on location (e.g., in cartilage). It has been estimated that an adult human contains ∼15 g of hyaluronan and that about one-third turns over daily. Turnover appears to occur by receptor-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation either locally or after transport by lymph to lymph nodes or by blood to liver. The endothelial cells of the lymph node and liver sinusoids remove hyaluronan via specific receptors, such as LYVE-1 (a homolog of CD44) and HARE (hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis). HARE appears to be the major clearance receptor for hyaluronan delivered systemically by lymph and blood. The current understanding of this catabolic process is that hyaluronidases at the cell surface and in the lysosome cooperate to degrade the chains. Large hyaluronan polymers in the extracellular space can be internalized following interaction with cell-surface receptors that trigger endocytosis, which may be facilitated by the membrane-associated hyaluronidases, HYAL2 and/or TMEM2, or through association with CEMIP. The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The importance of the turnover process for growth and survival is demonstrated by the respective embryonic lethal phenotypes in animal models. Hyal2-null mice and Tmem2-deficient zebrafish both suffer embryonic lethality as a result of cardiac developmental defects. CEMIP is important for clearing hyaluronan accumulation during bacterial infection in mice. In humans, a lysosomal storage disorder was found to result from mutation of HYAL1 (Chapter 44). Hyaluronan fragments have been suggested to act as an endogenous signal of injury, or during infection by Group A Streptococcus, which contains a hyaluronan capsule. The signaling activity of hyaluronan fragments is mediated through binding of cell-surface receptors, such as CD44, which in turn modulates response through Toll-like receptors.'
 'The fold consists of about 100 amino acids and contains four cysteines disulfide-bonded in the pattern Cys1-Cys4 and Cys2-Cys3. This fold has only been found in vertebrates, consistent with the fact that hyaluronan is a relatively recent evolutionary invention. The link module fold is related to that found in the C-type lectins, but it lacks the Ca++ binding motif (Chapter 34). In the case of TSG-6, the interaction of hyaluronan with the protein involves ionic interactions between positively charged amino acid residues and the carboxyl groups of the uronic acids, and hydrophobic interactions between the acetamido side chains of two N-acetylglucosamine residues and hydrophobic pockets on either side of adjacent tyrosines (Figure 16.5). Many of these features are conserved in other members of the hyaluronan-binding proteins. Subgroups, however, differ in the preferred size and length of hyaluronan for binding (e.g., hexasaccharides to decasaccharides). Structure of the link module. (A) TSG-6 contains a prototypical link module defined by two α-helices (α1 and α2) and two triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (β1,2,6 and β3–5). (Redrawn, with permission, (more...) Some hyaluronan-binding proteins do not contain a link module (RHAMM, ITI, SPACR, SPACRCAN, CD38, CDC37, HABP1/P-32, Siglec-9, and IHABP4), and most of these are unrelated to one another by primary sequence. Some of these proteins contain sequences of nine amino acids, referred to as BX7B motifs (where B is either lysine or arginine and X can be any amino acid other than acidic residues), but the actual hyaluronan docking site of the chain with this motif has not been established. Thus, the presence of the BX7B motif should not be taken as proof that the protein interacts with hyaluronan. Hyaluronan production has long been implicated in enhanced cell adhesion and locomotion because it is present abundantly during morphogenesis and in both physiological and pathological invasive processes. Five different types of cell signaling proteins have been found to mediate the complex breadth of functions associated with hyaluronan (Figure 16.6). Hyaluronan signaling in health and disease. CD44, cluster of differentiation antigen, a type I transmembrane receptor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HARE, hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis; LYVE-1, lymphatic vessel endothelial (more...) Toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4, which are components of the innate immune system responsive to bacterial pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been found to signal differentially in response to the generation of hyaluronan oligosaccharides by hyaluronidase. Depending on cell type, this may occur through direct binding of the hyaluronan oligosaccharides by TLR2/4. Alternatively, because hyaluronan encapsulation can obstruct access of TLR2/4 by other known ligands, hyaluronidase-mediated capsule degradation can also facilitate TLR2/4 activation by allowing other ligands to bind. HARE is expressed on the cell surface of a variety of sinusoidal endothelial cell types, where it is capable of binding hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycan ligands, subsequently triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis and thereby clearing these components from circulation. Signaling occurs optimally during uptake of 50- to 250-kDa hyaluronan; smaller or larger hyaluronan does not activate signaling and blocks signaling by 50- to 250-kDa hyaluronan. Signaling through both TLR2/4 and HARE activate NF-κB and promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cytokines. CD44 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by many cell types, and it varies markedly in glycosylation, oligomerization, and protein sequence because of differential mRNA splicing.'
 'Signaling through both TLR2/4 and HARE activate NF-κB and promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cytokines. CD44 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by many cell types, and it varies markedly in glycosylation, oligomerization, and protein sequence because of differential mRNA splicing. CD44 contains a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane segment, and an ectodomain with a single link module that can bind hyaluronan. When hyaluronan binds to CD44, the cytoplasmic tail can interact with regulatory and adaptor molecules, such as SRC kinases, RHO (ras homolog) GTPases, VAV2 (a human proto-oncogene), GAB1 (a GRB2-associated binding protein), and ankyrin and ezrin (which regulate cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell migration). Binding of hyaluronan to CD44H (the isoform expressed by hematopoietic cells) can mediate leukocyte rolling and extravasation in some tissues. Interaction of hyaluronan with CD44 can also regulate ErbB-family (including epithelial growth factor receptor, HER2) signaling, thereby activating the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)–PKB (protein kinase B/AKT) signaling pathway and phosphorylation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and BAD (BCL2-antagonist of cell death), which promote cell survival. Changes in CD44 expression, notably expression of CD44 variants, are associated with a wide variety of tumors and the metastatic spread of cancer. LYVE-1 is a lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor that is a homolog of CD44. Importantly, LYVE-1 signals uniquely through growth factor stimuli in lymphatic vasculature and lymph nodes to promote circulating leukocyte adhesion and support lymphatic development. Many cells also express RHAMM, which is also known as HMMR (homeostasis, mitosis, and meiosis regulator) and is involved in cell motility and cell division. The RHAMM pathway is thought to induce focal adhesions to signal the cytoskeletal changes required for elevated cell motility seen in tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. RHAMM splice variants exist, some of which may be intracellular. RHAMM possesses a BX7B sequence that promotes electrostatic interaction with hyaluronan but is also part of a basic leucine zipper motif that is capable of centrosome and microtubule interactions. Thus, RHAMM is also a nonmotor spindle assembly factor. Hyaluronan binding to RHAMM activates SRC, FAK, ERK (extracellular mitogen-regulated protein kinase), and PKC (protein tyrosine kinase C) (Chapter 40). These pathways are relevant to tumor cell survival and invasion; their inhibition by hyaluronan oligomers and soluble hyaluronan-binding proteins suggests novel therapeutic approaches for treating cancer (Chapter 47). Some pathogenic bacteria (e.g., certain strains of Streptococcus and Pasteurella) produce hyaluronan as an extracellular capsule; also see Chapter 21). Capsular hyaluronan, like other capsular polysaccharides, increases virulence by helping to shield the microbe from host defenses. For example, the capsule blocks phagocytosis and protects against complement-mediated killing. Because bacterial hyaluronan is identical in structure to host hyaluronan, the capsule can also prevent the formation of protective antibodies. Thus, the formation of hyaluronan capsules by bacteria is a form of molecular mimicry. The capsule also can aid in bacterial adhesion to host tissue, facilitating colonization (Chapter 37). Finally, the production of hyaluronan by invading bacteria can also induce a number of signaling events through hyaluronan-binding proteins that modulate the host physiology (i.e., cytokine production; Chapter 42). In addition to bacteria, an algal virus (Chlorella) encodes a hyaluronan synthase. The functional significance of viral hyaluronan production is unknown, but could be related to prevention of secondary viral infection, increase in host capacity to produce virus, or viral burst size.'
 'CEMIP is important for clearing hyaluronan accumulation during bacterial infection in mice. In humans, a lysosomal storage disorder was found to result from mutation of HYAL1 (Chapter 44). Hyaluronan fragments have been suggested to act as an endogenous signal of injury, or during infection by Group A Streptococcus, which contains a hyaluronan capsule. The signaling activity of hyaluronan fragments is mediated through binding of cell-surface receptors, such as CD44, which in turn modulates response through Toll-like receptors. Signaling through these and other receptors is affected by the size of the hyaluronan fragments, but the mechanism underlying the dependence of activity on the size of the fragments remains an area of active research. Hyaluronan has multiple roles in early development, tissue organization, and cell proliferation. The Has2-null mouse shows an embryonic lethal phenotype at the time of heart formation, whereas Has1-, Has3-null, and Has1/3 compound mutant mice show no obvious developmental phenotype. Interestingly, explanted cells from the Has2-null embryonic heart do not synthesize hyaluronan or undergo epithelial–mesenchymal transformation and migration unless small amounts of hyaluronan are added to the culture medium. This finding indicates that the production of hyaluronan at key points may be essential for many tissue morphogenetic transformations—in this case, formation of the tricuspid and mitral valves. Many of the activities of hyaluronan depend on binding proteins present on the cell surface and/or secreted into the extracellular matrix. A class of proteins that bind selectively to hyaluronan was first discovered in cartilage. This class is now referred to as the link module family of hyaladherins (Figure 16.3). Proteoglycans were efficiently extracted from this tissue with denaturing solvents and were shown to reaggregate when restored to renaturing conditions. An essential protein, referred to as the link protein (HAPLN-1), was shown to be necessary for stabilizing the proteoglycan aggregates, and subsequently, the structure of the aggregate was defined (Figure 16.4). The link protein contains two homologous repeats of a sequence motif, now named the link module. Proteins that have a link module, including link proteins (HAPLN-1 through HAPLN-4 in humans), several proteoglycans, and other extracellular matrix proteins, can interact specifically with hyaluronan. The major cartilage proteoglycan, now named aggrecan (Chapter 17), also contains a globular domain, the G1 domain, with two homologous link modules that interact with hyaluronan. An additional domain in HAPLN-1 cooperatively interacts with a homologous domain in G1, which locks the proteoglycan on the hyaluronan chain. In the absence of the HAPLN-1, aggrecan fails to anchor to hyaluronan. Mice deficient in HAPLN-1 show defects in cartilage development and delayed bone formation (short limbs and craniofacial anomalies). Most mutant mice die shortly after birth as a result of respiratory failure, and the few survivors develop progressive skeletal deformities. Modular organization of the link module superfamily of hyaluronan-binding proteins. These proteins contain one or two link modules that bind to hyaluronan. Like many extracellular matrix proteins, the link module superfamily members contain various subdomains, (more...) The large cartilage chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan (aggrecan) forms an aggregate with hyaluronan and link protein.  Interestingly, there are four proteoglycan genes with homologous G1 domains that interact with hyaluronan (versican, neurocan, brevican, and aggrecan) (Figure 16.3). Versican is a major component of many soft tissues and is especially important in vascular biology. Neurocan and brevican are expressed predominantly in brain tissue. Versican and aggrecan are anchored to hyaluronan in tissues by similar link protein-dependent mechanisms, and it is likely that neurocan and brevican are organized similarly. In the brain, these complexes form perineuronal nets.'
 'Versican is a major component of many soft tissues and is especially important in vascular biology. Neurocan and brevican are expressed predominantly in brain tissue. Versican and aggrecan are anchored to hyaluronan in tissues by similar link protein-dependent mechanisms, and it is likely that neurocan and brevican are organized similarly. In the brain, these complexes form perineuronal nets. Thus, hyaluronan acts as a scaffold on which to build proteoglycan aggregate structures adapted to diverse tissue functions. An impressive example of the requirement for a hyaluronan-based matrix occurs during the process of cumulus oophorus expansion in the mammalian preovulatory follicle. At the beginning of this process, the oocyte is surrounded by about 1000 cumulus cells tightly compacted and in gap-junction contact with the oocyte. In response to hormonal stimuli, the cumulus cells up-regulate HAS2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6; see the next section). The expression of these proteins initiates production of hyaluronan and its organization into an expanding matrix around the cumulus cells. Concurrently, the follicle becomes permeable to serum, which introduces an unusual molecule called inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (ITI), composed of the trypsin inhibitor bikunin and two heavy chains all covalently bound to a chondroitin sulfate chain. TSG-6 catalyzes the transfer of heavy chains that are covalently linked to chondroitin sulfate onto the newly synthesized hyaluronan. In the absence of either TSG-6 or ITI, the matrix does not form, and the phenotype of mice null for either of these molecules is female infertility. At the time of ovulation, hyaluronan synthesis ceases, and ovulation of the expanded cumulus cell–oocyte complex occurs. Before fertilization, individual sperm undergo capacitation enabling them to penetrate and fertilize an ovum. During this process, SPAM1, a GPI-anchored hyaluronidase, redistributes and accumulates in the sperm head. SPAM1 binds hyaluronan in the cumulus, causing an increase in Ca++ flux and sperm motility. It also helps dissolve the cumulus matrix as the sperm moves through the hyaluronan vestment. A soluble form of SPAM1 is secreted during the acrosome reaction. The release of acrosomal hyaluronidase and proteases renders the sperm capable of fusing with the egg and eventually destroys the entire matrix to allow the fertilized oocyte to implant and develop. There are several hyaluronan-binding proteins with homologous link modules (Figure 16.3). The four homologous link proteins belong to a subfamily called the “hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins” (HAPLNs); these are expressed in many tissues. Four cell-surface receptors have extracellular domains with one link module: CD44, LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor), HARE/Stabilin-2 (hepatic hyaluronan clearance receptor), and Stabilin-1, which are expressed on discontinuous endothelial cells and some activated macrophages. Of these, all functionally bind hyaluronan through the link module except Stabilin-1. Other hyaluronan-binding proteins are secreted and include the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that comprise the aggrecan superfamily and TSG-6, which has one link module. The three-dimensional structure of the link module fold in TSG-6 has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and defines a consensus fold of the two α-helices and two triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (Figure 16.5). The fold consists of about 100 amino acids and contains four cysteines disulfide-bonded in the pattern Cys1-Cys4 and Cys2-Cys3. This fold has only been found in vertebrates, consistent with the fact that hyaluronan is a relatively recent evolutionary invention. The link module fold is related to that found in the C-type lectins, but it lacks the Ca++ binding motif (Chapter 34).']","The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.","The hyaluronan fragments may be returned to the extracellular space via recycling endosomes or enter a pathway to lysosomes for complete degradation to monosaccharides, probably involving HYAL1 and the two exoglycosidases β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.",1.0,0.6364748919574338,1.0000000000000004,0.0078125,0.99999999998,1.0

In heparin/heparan sulfate formation, the addition of the first N-acetylglucosamine residue is catalyzed by an enzyme called EXTL3, which differs from the transferases involved in heparan polymerization (called EXT1 and EXT2). These enzymes are important control points because they ultimately regulate the type of glycosaminoglycan chain that will assemble. Control of the addition of β4GalNAc or α4GlcNAc appears to be manifested at the level of enzyme recognition of the polypeptide substrate. Keratan sulfate chains contain a mixture of nonsulfated (Galβ4GlcNAcβ3), monosulfated (Galβ4GlcNAc6Sβ3), and disulfated (Gal6Sβ4GlcNAc6Sβ3) disaccharide units (Figure 17.2). The biosynthesis of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone is described in Chapter 14. At least two classes of sulfotransferases, one or more N-acetylglucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferases (e.g., CHST4 or CHST6), and one or two galactosyl 6-O-sulfotransferases (CHST1 and CHST3) catalyze the sulfation reactions. These enzymes, like other sulfotransferases, use activated sulfate (PAPS [3′-phosphoadenyl-5′-phosphosulfate]) as a high-energy donor (Chapter 5). 6-O-Sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine occurs on the nonreducing terminal residue, encouraging further chain elongation, whereas sulfation of galactose residues takes place on nonreducing terminal and internal galactose residues, with a preference for galactose units adjacent to a sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residue. Sulfation of a nonreducing terminal galactose residue blocks further elongation of the chain, providing a potential mechanism for controlling chain length. The poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains of KS I are generally longer than those of KS II and may contain up to 50 disaccharide units (20–25 kDa). The chains can be fucosylated and sialylated as well (Chapter 14). Vertebrate chondroitin sulfate consists of repeating sulfate-substituted GalNAcβ4GlcAβ3 disaccharides polymerized into long chains (Figure 17.2). In contrast, invertebrates such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster make either nonsulfated or low sulfated chains. The assembly process for the backbone appears to be highly conserved, based on the presence of homologous genes for all of the reactions (Chapters 25 and 26). As described above, the assembly process is initiated by the transfer of GalNAcβ3 to the linkage tetrasaccharide (Figure 17.4). In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the polymerization step is catalyzed by one or more bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both β3 glucuronosyltransferase and β4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF), a protein that lacks independent activity but collaborates with the polymerases to enhance the formation of polymers. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 17.5).'
 'KS I, originally detected in cornea, is found on an N-glycan linked to protein through an asparagine residue (Chapter 9). KS II (skeletal keratan sulfate) is found on an O-glycan core 2 structure and is thus linked through N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine (Chapter 10). The structural features in control of keratan sulfate substitution remain unclear, as the underlying poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone can be found on many other glycoproteins. Notably, in humans and bovine, the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan found in cartilage (aggrecan) contains a segment of four to 23 hexapeptide repeats (E-E/L-P-F-P-S) where the keratan sulfate chains are located, whereas aggrecan in rats and other rodents lacks this motif and does not contain keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfates (KS) contain a sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain, linked to either asparagine or serine/threonine residues. Chst1 and 5 can add sulfate groups at the indicated positions. The actual order of the various sulfated and nonsulfated (more...) Two classes of glycosaminoglycan chains—chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate/heparin—are linked to serine residues in proteins by way of xylose (Figure 17.4). Xylosyltransferase initiates the process using UDP-xylose as donor. Two isoforms of the enzyme are known in vertebrates (XYLT1 and XYLT2), but only one isozyme exists in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. A glycine residue invariably lies to the carboxy-terminal side of the serine attachment site, but a perfect consensus sequence for xylosylation does not exist. At least two acidic amino acid residues are usually present, and they can be located on one or both sides of the serine, usually within a few residues. Several proteoglycans contain clustered glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, raising the possibility that xylosyltransferase could act in a processive manner. Xylosylation is an incomplete process in some proteoglycans, which may explain why proteoglycans with multiple potential attachment sites contain different numbers of chains in different cells. The biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (left chain) and heparan sulfate (right chain) is initiated by the formation of a linkage region tetrasaccharide (green circles in Fig. 17.1). Addition of the first hexosamine commits the intermediate to either (more...) After xylose addition, a linkage tetrasaccharide assembles by the transfer of two galactose residues catalyzed by unique members of the β4 galactosyl-, β3 galactosyl-, and β3 glucuronosyltransferase families of enzymes (Figure 17.4). This intermediate can undergo phosphorylation at the C-2 position of xylose and in the case of chondroitin sulfate, sulfation of the galactose residues. In general, phosphorylation and sulfation occur substoichiometrically, but phosphorylation may be transient. Phosphorylation occurs early in the assembly process and creates the preferred substrate for B4GALT7; a phosphatase removes the phosphate at a later stage of biosynthesis. The function of galactose sulfation in chondroitin sulfate remains unclear. The linkage tetrasaccharide lies at a bifurcation in the biosynthetic pathway: addition of β4-linked N-acetylgalactosamine, which initiates chondroitin sulfate assembly, or addition of α4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, which initiates heparan sulfate assembly (Figure 17.4). Genetic evidence from studies of C. elegans suggests that N-acetylgalactosamine addition during chondroitin assembly is mediated by the same enzyme that is involved in chain polymerization (Sqv5), but biochemical evidence suggests that more than one enzyme may exist in vertebrates.'
 'Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF), a protein that lacks independent activity but collaborates with the polymerases to enhance the formation of polymers. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 17.5). Biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate involves the polymerization of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid units and a series of modification reactions including O-sulfation and epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid. Heparan (more...) Additional enzymes exist for epimerization of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid in dermatan sulfate (DSE1-2), sulfation at the C-2 position of the uronic acids, and other patterns of sulfation found in unusual species of chondroitin (Table 17.2). The location of sulfate groups is easily assessed using bacterial chondroitinases (ABC, B, and ACII) that cleave the chains into disaccharides. Many chains are hybrid structures containing more than one type of chondroitin disaccharide unit. For example, dermatan sulfate is defined as having one or more iduronic acid–containing disaccharide units (chondroitin sulfate B) as well as glucuronic acid–containing disaccharides (chondroitin sulfate A and C). Animal cells also degrade chondroitin sulfate in lysosomes using a series of exolytic activities (Chapter 44). Types of chondroitin sulfates  Heparan sulfate assembles as a copolymer of GlcNAcα4GlcAβ4 (Figure 17.5), which then undergoes extensive modification reactions, catalyzed by at least four families of sulfotransferases and one epimerase. N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (NDST1-4) act on a subset of N-acetylglucosamine residues to generate N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNSO3) units, many of which occur in clusters along the chain. Generally, the enzyme deacetylates N-acetylglucosamine and rapidly adds sulfate to the free amino group to form GlcNSO3, but a small number of glucosamine residues with unsubstituted amino groups may arise from incomplete N-sulfation. An epimerase (GLCE), different from the one involved in dermatan sulfate synthesis, then acts on some glucuronic acid residues, followed by 2-O-sulfation of some of the iduronic acid units (catalyzed by HS2ST). Some glucuronic acid units also undergo 2-O-sulfation by the same enzyme. The addition of 2-O-sulfate groups to glucuronic or iduronic acid prevents the reversible epimerization reaction. Next, 6-O-sulfotransferases (HS6ST1-3) add sulfate groups to selected glucosamine residues. Finally, certain subsequences of sulfated sugar residues and uronic acid epimers provide targets for 3-O-sulfotransferases (HS3ST1-6). Unlike other glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate is further modified once displayed at the plasma membrane. A family of plasma membrane endosulfatases (SULFs) can remove sulfate groups from internal 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate and a heparanase can cleave the chains at limited sites. This post-assembly processing of the chains at the cell surface results in altered response of cells to growth factors and morphogens. Intriguingly, the mammalian genome contains other sulfatases of unknown function, raising the possibility that other post-assembly processing reactions of glycosaminoglycans may occur.'
 'The requirement for chondroitin assembly in seemingly disparate systems may result from biophysical changes in the lumen of the vulva or between the eggshell and the embryo. One idea is that the high negative charge imparted by the glucuronic acids in chondroitin attracts counterions that raise the local osmolarity, causing a swelling pressure. Another possibility is that the chondroitin acts as a physical scaffold bound to the cell membrane or eggshell. Interestingly, the sqv screen did not detect mutations affecting genes that encode proteoglycan core proteins on which the chondroitin chains assemble, but proteomic analysis has led to the identification of nine novel chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CPG) core proteins modified with chondroitin chains (Figure 25.6). Two of these (CPG-1 and CPG-2) contain chitin-binding domains that presumably allow the proteoglycans to interact with chitin in the eggshell, thus positioning the proteoglycans between the eggshell and the plasma membrane of the embryo, in which they could serve as spacers or osmotic regulators. Silencing cpg-1 and cpg-2 expression by RNAi recapitulates the cytokinesis defect observed in sqv mutants, suggesting that these are the relevant proteoglycans. The proteoglycans involved in epithelial invagination have not yet been determined. Chondroitin proteoglycans (CPGs) of Caenorhabditis elegans.  HS biosynthesis in C. elegans follows the same pattern observed in vertebrate systems (Chapter 17). Mutations in the pathway for HS biosynthesis are lethal in C. elegans. Two of the key genes involved in this pathway are rib-1 and rib-2, homologs of the vertebrate genes Ext2 and Ext1, respectively, which catalyze the polymerization of the backbone of HS chains (GlcAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-4) (Chapter 17). Mutants in rib-2, the worm homolog of Ext1, have defects in development and egg laying. The worm genome also contains a single gene for glucuronic acid C-5 epimerase (hse-5) and five genes for sulfotransferase activities (GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase [Ndst], hst-1; uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase, hst-2; 3-O-sulfotransferases, hst-3.1 and hst-3.2; and 6-O-sulfotransferase, hst-6), all of which are homologs of vertebrate genes involved in HS synthesis. In contrast, vertebrates contain four Ndsts, three 6-O-sulfotransferases, and seven 3-O-sulfotransferases. Although mutations in the epimerase (hse-5) and the sulfotransferases (hst-6, hst-2) do not affect viability, they cause defects in specific cell migration, axonal outgrowth, and/or neurite branching. Consistent with this finding, inactivation of the cell surface HS proteoglycan syndecan (sdn-1) affects neural migration and axonal guidance. C. elegans also produces two GPI-anchored HS proteoglycans. LON-2, a member of the glypican family, negatively regulates a bone morphogenetic protein-like signaling pathway that controls body length in C. elegans. Worms also contain a homolog of the vertebrate basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan (encoded by unc-52). At least three major classes of UNC-52 isoforms are produced through alternative splicing, and distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns occur throughout development. In keeping with the “uncoordinated” phenotype, unc-52 mutants affect myofilament assembly in body-wall muscle during embryonic development. Thus, as in vertebrates, HS proteoglycans mediate many fundamental processes during development and in the adult animal. The arthro-series glycolipids in C. elegans include structures modified with either phosphorylcholine or fucose residues (Figure 25.7A).'
 'A family of plasma membrane endosulfatases (SULFs) can remove sulfate groups from internal 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate and a heparanase can cleave the chains at limited sites. This post-assembly processing of the chains at the cell surface results in altered response of cells to growth factors and morphogens. Intriguingly, the mammalian genome contains other sulfatases of unknown function, raising the possibility that other post-assembly processing reactions of glycosaminoglycans may occur. In contrast to chondroitin chains, which tend to have long tracts of fully modified disaccharides, the modification reactions in heparan sulfate biosynthesis occur in clusters along the chain, with regions devoid of sulfate separating the modified domains. In general, the reactions proceed in the order indicated, with evidence for functional interdependence within and between the biosynthetic enzyme families, but they often fail to go to completion, resulting in tremendous chemical heterogeneity. The disaccharide composition of glycosaminoglycan chains can be readily assessed using bacterial lyases or chemical degradation methods (which are more useful for differentiating glucuronic and iduronic acids). Direct sequencing of the chains has proved difficult because of their heterogeneity, however the application of specific lysosomal exoenzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan degradation and new mass spectrometry methods are making significant inroads into sequencing of glycosaminoglycans (Chapter 50). The specific arrangement of sulfated residues and uronic acid epimers in heparin/heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate gives rise to binding sequences for proteins. The three examples shown in Figure 17.5 show sequences that can interact with antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, and other potential proteins. More modified sequences can interact as well, and the binding of many ligands is dependent on the presence of correctly orientated charged clusters rather than the specific presence of individual sulfated groups. Binding of glycosaminoglycans to proteins is described in greater detail in Chapter 38. A major question remains regarding how the enzymes and biosynthetic pathways are regulated to achieve tissue-specific expression of protein-binding sequences. During the last decade, most if not all of the enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis have been purified and molecularly cloned from mammals and model organisms. Several important features have emerged from these studies, which may shed light on how different protein-binding sequences arise. Arrays of synthetic glycosaminoglycans used to probe the importance of chain length, sulfation pattern, and chain density are now in common use and enable the rapid screening of glycosaminoglycan–protein interactions. As highlighted above, care needs to be taken when inferring a biological effect from these interactions. However, recently developed chemical strategies for creating artificial proteoglycans at the cell surface together with new opportunities for altering cell surface display of glycosaminoglycans using gene editing, or by application of soluble inhibitors/activators to influence components of the biosynthetic pathway, offer controlled environments with which to test glycosaminoglycan–protein interactions at the cellular level. Considerable confusion exists regarding the definition of heparin and heparan sulfate (even the spelling is often in error!). Heparin is produced by a limited number of cells, notably connective tissue-type mast cells and bipotential glial progenitor cells, whereas heparan sulfate is made by virtually all types of cells. During biosynthesis, heparin undergoes more extensive sulfation and uronic acid epimerization, such that >80% of the N-acetylglucosamine residues are N-deacetylated and N-sulfated and >70% of the glucuronic acids undergo epimerization to iduronic acid. Heparin derived from porcine entrails and bovine lung is prepared commercially by selective precipitation and is sold by pharmaceutical companies as an anticoagulant because of its high capacity to bind to antithrombin (Chapters 38 and 57). The active sequence is a pentasaccharide shown in Figure 17.5, which is now sold as a purely synthetic anticoagulant (Arixtra). Low-molecular-weight heparins are derived from commercial unfractionated heparin by chemical or enzymatic cleavage, depending on the brand.']","In heparin/heparan sulfate formation, the addition of the first N-acetylglucosamine residue is catalyzed by an enzyme called EXTL3, which differs from the transferases involved in heparan polymerization (called EXT1 and EXT2).","These enzymes are important control points because they ultimately regulate the type of glycosaminoglycan chain that will assemble. Control of the addition of β4GalNAc or α4GlcNAc appears to be manifested at the level of enzyme recognition of the polypeptide substrate. Keratan sulfate chains contain a mixture of nonsulfated (Galβ4GlcNAcβ3), monosulfated (Galβ4GlcNAc6Sβ3), and disulfated (Gal6Sβ4GlcNAc6Sβ3) disaccharide units (Figure 17.2).",1.0,0.7311711760620172,0.6132206244751617,0.009259259259259259,0.99999999998,1.0
"Complete the following paragraph: Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent.","[""In addition, both OGT and OGA are modified by both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation. Functions for some of these posttranslational modifications have been identified, including substrate targeting, altering protein localization, and altering specific activity. Notably, cellular O-GlcNAc levels control the maturation of OGT and OGA mRNA and, in turn, the abundance of each enzyme. Thus, when O-GlcNAc levels are elevated, OGT abundance is depressed and OGA abundance augmented. In contrast, in response to low levels of O-GlcNAc, OGA abundance is depressed, and OGT levels are augmented. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is regulated by multiple complex mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation of its expression, differential mRNA splicing, proteolytic processing, posttranslational modification, and multimerization with itself and other (more...) OGT (uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine: polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.255) catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc to specific serine or threonine residues to form a β-O-glycosidic linkage. The enzyme was first identified and purified from rat liver and subsequently cloned from rat, human, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other organisms. OGT resides on the X chromosome (Xq13 in humans) near the centromere and is among the most highly conserved proteins from worms to man. Mutations in OGT, both in its tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and in its catalytic domain, cause X-linked intellectual disability in humans. To date, three isoforms of OGT have been well characterized: (1) the nucleocytoplasmic or full-length variant (ncOGT), which is 110 kDa; (2) a short isoform of OGT (sOGT), which is 78 kDa; and (3) a variant of OGT that is targeted to the mitochondria (mOGT; ∼90 kDa). In the nucleus and cytoplasm, OGT appears to form multimers, consisting of one or more 110-kDa subunits and 78-kDa subunits. Several useful small molecule inhibitors of OGT have been developed, including OSMI-4b, Ac45SGlcNAc, and 5SGlcNHex, with the latter effective in animal models. However, some off-target effects have been reported for these inhibitors, likely because they impact other enzymes that use UDP-GlcNAc. ncOGT has two distinct domains separated by a putative nuclear localization sequence. The amino terminus of each OGT subunit contains TPRs, which can number up to 13 (species-dependent). The major variation between the three (above) variants is in the number of the TPRs. The crystal structure of the human TPR domain of ncOGT shows that the repeats occur as stacked α-helical domains, forming a “tube-like” structure with a remarkable structural similarity to the armadillo repeat domain of the nuclear transport protein importin-α. The TPR domain mediates multimerization of OGT subunits and acts as a scaffold for protein–protein interactions, including protein substrates (Figure 19.3). OGT's glycosyltransfer reaction occurs by an ordered bi–bi mechanism with UDP-GlcNAc binding first. The TPR domains are required for substrate binding, enzymatic activity, and stability. Recent studies have demonstrated that residues in the TPR domain are critical for interactions with substrates. Such findings likely underpin the observation that there is no strict consensus motif that dictates glycosylation by OGT, although valine and alanine are preferred at the –3 and +2 positions, respectively, and there is a preference for aromatic residues at –4 position. In addition to catalyzing O-GlcNAcylation, OGT also has the remarkable ability to proteolytically cleave HCF-1, a transcription factor regulating the cell cycle. HCF-1 binds to the TPRs positioning the cleavage site at the active site of OGT.""
 'Mutations in SEC cause severe growth phenotypes, but they are not lethal. Interestingly, simultaneous mutation of SEC and the paralogous SPY gene, which encodes an OGT-related fucosyltransferase, is lethal. Studies in rice, potatoes, and other plants have also indicated that O-GlcNAcylation is important for growth regulation. Mammals and insects appear to have only a single gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the OGT. Using Cre-LoxP conditional gene disruption in mice, OGT was shown to be required for the viability of embryonic stem cells. Tissue-targeted disruption in mice and disruption of OGT expression in cell culture have established that O-GlcNAcylation is essential for viability at the single-cell level in many mammalian cell types. Disruption of OGT in the worm C. elegans causes defective carbohydrate metabolism, abnormalities in dauer formation, and reduced life span. In Drosophila, homozygous mutants in the OGT ortholog super sex combs survive for >5 days until the late larval stage, but subsequently die in the pupal cases. Targeted, inducible deletion of OGT in αCAMKII-positive (excitatory) neurons in brains of adult mice results in morbidly obese mice because of defects in satiety, further supporting the roles of O-GlcNAcylation as a nutrient sensor. The highly homologous and conserved nature of OGT among metazoans allows a transgene encoding the human sequence of OGT to be used to rescue OGT null Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, OGA has been disrupted in both C. elegans and mammalian models. Like the OGT null, the C. elegans OGA null has defective carbohydrate metabolism and abnormalities in dauer formation. In contrast to the OGT null, in C. elegans in which OGA has been disrupted, the worms have an extended life span. In murine models, deletion of OGA leads to perinatal lethality, genomic instability and severe epigenetic and metabolic phenotypes. The OGA heterozygous mouse shows widespread changes in transcription and metabolism, and an enhanced dependence on glucose metabolism. Studies from numerous laboratories have described O-GlcNAcylated proteins from virtually all cellular compartments, representing nearly all functional classes of protein (Figure 19.2; Table 19.1). Indeed, recent databases contain more than 6,000 O-GlcNAcylated proteins with more than 7,000 sites mapped (O-GlcNAcAtlas; The O-GlcNAc Database). O-GlcNAc is particularly abundant within the nucleus, in which it occurs on the transcriptional regulatory machinery, including the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II catalytic subunit and basal, as well as other, transcription factors, histones, chromatin-modifying proteins, mRNA biogenesis proteins, and DNA methyltransferases. O-GlcNAcylation also appears to be particularly abundant on proteins involved in signaling, stress responses, and energy metabolism. Nearly 90 proteins within the mitochondria are dynamically O-GlcNAcylated, with the highest concentration found within the electron transport chain. O-GlcNAc also occurs on many cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, such as those regulating actin assembly (e.g., vinculin, talin, vimentin, and ankyrin) and tubulin assembly (e.g., MAPs, dynein, and tau). Even α-tubulin itself is dynamically modified by O-GlcNAc, but the stoichiometry appears to be low. Intermediate filaments, such as cytokeratins and neurofilaments in brain, are also heavily modified by O-GlcNAc. Site-mapping studies have shown that protein kinases and OGT can often modify the same serine and threonine residues, suggesting that a complex interplay exists between these two posttranslational modifications that fine-tunes signal transduction networks. In fact, major enzymes that remove O-phosphate, protein phosphatase 1 β and γ, are in a dynamic complex with OGT, suggesting that in many cases the same enzyme complex both removes O-phosphate and concomitantly attaches O-GlcNAc (Figure 19.1).'
 'Notably, the HAT domain lacks the motif required for binding acetyl-CoA, indicating it lacks HAT enzymatic activity. Like OGT, OGA is thought to be regulated by its protein interactors, posttranslational modifications, and localization. OGA can be efficiently inhibited in vitro and in vivo by a panel of highly effective inhibitors. Although many inhibitors display some cross-reactivity toward the lysosomal hexosaminidases, GlcNAcstatin B and Thiamet-G are selective for OGA. Unlike the relatively static nature of mature N- and O-glycans on glycoproteins, O-GlcNAc cycles rapidly on and off most substrates. Early studies showed that mitogen or antigen activation of lymphocytes rapidly decreased O-GlcNAcylation of many cytoplasmic proteins, but concomitantly increased O-GlcNAcylation of many nuclear proteins. Likewise, neutrophils were shown to rapidly modulate O-GlcNAcylation of several proteins in response to chemotactic agents. Recently, changes in O-GlcNAc cycling have been shown in response to cellular stress, the cell cycle, developmental stages, neuron depolarization, nutrient sensing, and insulin signaling. Pulse-chase analyses have revealed that O-GlcNAc residues on small heat-shock protein in the lens (α-crystallin) and on intermediate filament proteins (cytokeratins) turn over more rapidly than the polypeptide chains to which they are attached. These observations suggest that O-GlcNAc is a regulatory posttranslational modification analogous to phosphorylation. To date, nucleocytoplasmic O-β-GlcNAc has been found in all multicellular organisms investigated, ranging from filamentous fungi, worms, insects, and plants to humans. However, to date no OGA ortholog has been identified in plants or protozoans. Plants encode two OGT paralogs: SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPY. Curiously, whereas SEC encodes an O-GlcNAc transferase, SPY encodes a fucosyltransferase. Notably, the SPY paralog in Dictyostelium discoideum, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Toxoplasma gondii also fucosylates proteins. To date, O-GlcNAc and the enzymes that control its cycling do not appear to exist in yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. However, recently, it was discovered that S. cerevisiae have O-mannose moieties on the same proteins and at the same sites on which O-GlcNAc is found in multicellular organisms. Recent data suggest that the O-GlcNAc modification is also found in a subset of prokaryotes, such as Listeria monocytogenes. It is currently unclear if the enzymes responsible for this modification are related to OGT or EOGT. O-GlcNAc-modified proteins have also been found on many viruses that infect metazoans (e.g., adenovirus, SV40, cytomegalovirus, rotavirus, baculovirus, plum pox, HIV, and others). In viruses, instead of being localized on the outside capsid of the virus in which “classical” N- or O-glycans are found (Chapter 42), O-GlcNAc is found deep within the viruses, on tegument and other regulatory proteins, close to the nucleic acid components. Genetic and subsequent biochemical studies in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that the gene SEC regulates growth hormone (gibberellic acid) signaling, and later studies established that SEC encodes an O-β-GlcNAc transferase. Mutations in SEC cause severe growth phenotypes, but they are not lethal. Interestingly, simultaneous mutation of SEC and the paralogous SPY gene, which encodes an OGT-related fucosyltransferase, is lethal. Studies in rice, potatoes, and other plants have also indicated that O-GlcNAcylation is important for growth regulation. Mammals and insects appear to have only a single gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the OGT.'
 'In addition to catalyzing O-GlcNAcylation, OGT also has the remarkable ability to proteolytically cleave HCF-1, a transcription factor regulating the cell cycle. HCF-1 binds to the TPRs positioning the cleavage site at the active site of OGT. Cleavage occurs between cysteine and glutamate residues, yielding a pyroglutamate. The cleavage site glutamate is converted to serine, which is then O-GlcNAcylated. The cleavage reaction requires UDP-GlcNAc at the active site, which participates in the mechanism. The regulation of OGT is quite complex and still not well-understood. OGT is itself O-GlcNAcylated and also tyrosine-phosphorylated (Figure 19.3). Tyrosine phosphorylation appears to activate the enzyme, but the role of O-GlcNAc on OGT is not yet clear. Recent studies suggest that OGT is also targeted and regulated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation; AMPK, CAMKIV, CAMKII, and GSK3β have been reported to modify OGT, altering either the localization or activity of the enzyme. Purified or recombinant OGT modifies small synthetic peptides based on known sites from O-GlcNAcylated proteins, but OGT appears to require accessory proteins to modify many full-length protein substrates efficiently. The high-energy nucleotide sugar used by OGT is UDP-GlcNAc, which is synthesized by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Increased flux through the HBP, a result of increased glucose levels or certain upstream stimuli, such as the unfolded protein response, has been shown to modulate O-GlcNAc levels (Figure 19.4). On transfer of GlcNAc to proteins, UDP is released, which is a potent feedback inhibitor of OGT. Under conditions in which UDP is rapidly removed (as occurs within the cell), OGT activity is dependent on the UDP-GlcNAc level over a remarkable range of concentrations (from the low nm range to >50 mm). Of note, the substrate specificity of OGT appears to change at different UDP-GlcNAc concentrations, suggesting that OGT regulates cellular processes in a manner dependent on nutritional status. Elevating O-GlcNAc blocks insulin signaling at many points. Glucose flux via glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT4 in insulin-sensitive cells) through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP; which accounts for 2%–5% of total glucose usage) leads (more...) Nucleocytoplasmic OGA (EC 3.2.1.169) was first identified as a neutral cytosolic hexosaminidase (referred to as “hexosaminidase C”). OGA was purified from rat kidney and bovine brain, and the human gene was cloned using peptide sequence information. The OGA gene was found to be identical to MGEA5, a putative hyaluronidase genetically identified because of its association with meningiomas. There are two well-characterized isoforms of OGA (short and full-length), which appear to arise from alternative splicing. Short OGA is identical to full-length OGA (916 amino acids) for the first 662 amino acids but possesses an alternative carboxy-terminal sequence 15 amino acids in length. Sequence and structural analyses reveal that OGA contains an amino-terminal hexosaminidase domain and a carboxy-terminal domain, with homology to GCN5 histone acetyltransferases (HAT), separated by an intervening sequence. OGA forms an unusual arm-in-arm homodimer that is mediated by a helix within the intervening sequence. Dimerization is critical for activity and the formation of a substrate binding cleft. Notably, the HAT domain lacks the motif required for binding acetyl-CoA, indicating it lacks HAT enzymatic activity. Like OGT, OGA is thought to be regulated by its protein interactors, posttranslational modifications, and localization.

 'γ-Proteobacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, possess a nontraditional cytoplasmic pathway for N-glycosylation that does not involve assembly of oligosaccharides on a lipid-linked intermediate, but instead transfers single glycan moieties to proteins from nucleotide-activated precursors. The soluble GTs (NGTs) required for N-glycosylation in these organisms are also completely unrelated to the conventional STT3-orthologous OTases, yet prefer the eukaryotic sequon, N-X-S/T. H. influenzae N-glycosylates its autotransporter adhesion HMW1 with single glucose and galactose residues. In contrast, Shewanella oneidensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and N. meningitidis add rhamnose to Arg32 of their polyproline specific elongation factor to rescue stalled ribosomes. In addition to N-glycosylation, bacteria possess both canonical and noncanonical pathways for O-glycosylation. For the O-glycosylation system that mirrors the process in eukaryotes, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use nucleotide-activated sugars and soluble GTs in the cytoplasm to modify serine and threonine residues on specific proteins, particularly surface structures, such as flagella, pili, and adhesins. Pseudaminic acids, legionaminic acids, and related nonulosonic sugars are common monosaccharides attached by C. jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Aeromonas caviae to their flagella and these modifications are essential for filament assembly and bacterial motility. The noncanonical pathway for O-glycosylation in Gram-negative bacteria involves glycosyltransferase assembly of nucleotide-activated sugars onto undecaprenylphosphate, flipping of the completed oligosaccharide en bloc across the inner membrane into the periplasm, and addition of glycans onto S/T residues by a general OTase. This alternate pathway has been thoroughly characterized in Neisseria species, in which multiple proteins (including pilin) are glycosylated with an oligosaccharide containing diNAcBac (or variants such as glyceramidoacetamidotrideoxyhexose or diacetamidodideoxyglucopyranose) at the reducing end, the same carbohydrate attached to Asn residues by the C. jejuni N-glycosylation pathway. Gram-positive bacteria lack surface LPS, but many instead possess a regular array of glycoproteins known as S-layer proteins. The oligosaccharides on these S-layer proteins are also first assembled onto an undecaprenylphosphate carrier and subsequently added onto S/T residues of these proteins, but can also be coupled to hydroxyl groups of tyrosine residues. Bacteria encounter extreme differences in osmolarity in the environment (and must withstand up to 6 atmospheres of turgor pressure!) and have thus evolved both physical and chemical mechanisms to resist disruption. Peptidoglycan, as discussed earlier, provides a structural barrier to osmotic swelling. In many α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria, a chemical mechanism also exists to protect the inner membrane. In these Gram-negative organisms, osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs; previously known as membrane-derived oligosaccharides [MDOs]) contribute to an osmotic buffer. These compounds constitute up to 5% of the dry weight of E. coli, and their synthesis is induced by low osmotic conditions. These characteristics are similar to the production of fOS derived from the N-glycosylation pathways of Campylobacter species, which lack normal OPGs. OPGs were first discovered during analysis of Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture supernatants and rediscovered in studies of phospholipid turnover in E. coli, which showed that the polar head groups of phosphatidylglycerol were transferred to low-molecular-weight, water-soluble oligosaccharides (and thus named MDOs). Other organisms, including Pseudomonas, Rhizobia, Brucella, and Salmonella, also make these compounds.']","Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent. These bacterial homologs likely play important roles in posttranslational modifications and glycosylation processes within bacterial cells, similar to their counterparts in eukaryotic organisms. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific functions and significance of these bacterial OGT and OFT homologs in cellular physiology and disease progression.","An example of bacterial monoglycosylation that leads to a known function comes from the EF-P protein, the bacterial homolog of eukaryotic elongation initiation factor 5a. In some bacteria, EF-P suppresses translational stalling by a mechanism that involves oxidation of a critical lysyl residue, and its eukaryotic ortholog is regulated by hypusylation. A recent phylogenetic analysis of EF-P sequences revealed a subset of enzymes with an Arg in place of Lys, and a coevolving gene that was subsequently identified by biochemistry and mass spectrometry as an argininyl rhamnosyltransferase. Assembly of the Rha-Arg linkage activates EF-P and is required for pathogenicity of Pseudomonas, a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen, and a number of other bacteria. The discovery of this linkage by a phylogenetic approach suggests that more noncanonical examples of glycosylation are yet to be discovered.",0.0,0.8821759711210083,0.5538215932253752,0.00819672131147541,0.99999999998,1.0

OGT resides on the X chromosome (Xq13 in humans) near the centromere and is among the most highly conserved proteins from worms to man. Mutations in OGT, both in its tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and in its catalytic domain, cause X-linked intellectual disability in humans. To date, three isoforms of OGT have been well characterized: (1) the nucleocytoplasmic or full-length variant (ncOGT), which is 110 kDa; (2) a short isoform of OGT (sOGT), which is 78 kDa; and (3) a variant of OGT that is targeted to the mitochondria (mOGT; ∼90 kDa). In the nucleus and cytoplasm, OGT appears to form multimers, consisting of one or more 110-kDa subunits and 78-kDa subunits. Several useful small molecule inhibitors of OGT have been developed, including OSMI-4b, Ac45SGlcNAc, and 5SGlcNHex, with the latter effective in animal models. However, some off-target effects have been reported for these inhibitors, likely because they impact other enzymes that use UDP-GlcNAc. ncOGT has two distinct domains separated by a putative nuclear localization sequence. The amino terminus of each OGT subunit contains TPRs, which can number up to 13 (species-dependent). The major variation between the three (above) variants is in the number of the TPRs. The crystal structure of the human TPR domain of ncOGT shows that the repeats occur as stacked α-helical domains, forming a “tube-like” structure with a remarkable structural similarity to the armadillo repeat domain of the nuclear transport protein importin-α. The TPR domain mediates multimerization of OGT subunits and acts as a scaffold for protein–protein interactions, including protein substrates (Figure 19.3). OGT's glycosyltransfer reaction occurs by an ordered bi–bi mechanism with UDP-GlcNAc binding first. The TPR domains are required for substrate binding, enzymatic activity, and stability. Recent studies have demonstrated that residues in the TPR domain are critical for interactions with substrates. Such findings likely underpin the observation that there is no strict consensus motif that dictates glycosylation by OGT, although valine and alanine are preferred at the –3 and +2 positions, respectively, and there is a preference for aromatic residues at –4 position. In addition to catalyzing O-GlcNAcylation, OGT also has the remarkable ability to proteolytically cleave HCF-1, a transcription factor regulating the cell cycle. HCF-1 binds to the TPRs positioning the cleavage site at the active site of OGT.""
 'Notably, the HAT domain lacks the motif required for binding acetyl-CoA, indicating it lacks HAT enzymatic activity. Like OGT, OGA is thought to be regulated by its protein interactors, posttranslational modifications, and localization. OGA can be efficiently inhibited in vitro and in vivo by a panel of highly effective inhibitors. Although many inhibitors display some cross-reactivity toward the lysosomal hexosaminidases, GlcNAcstatin B and Thiamet-G are selective for OGA. Unlike the relatively static nature of mature N- and O-glycans on glycoproteins, O-GlcNAc cycles rapidly on and off most substrates. Early studies showed that mitogen or antigen activation of lymphocytes rapidly decreased O-GlcNAcylation of many cytoplasmic proteins, but concomitantly increased O-GlcNAcylation of many nuclear proteins. Likewise, neutrophils were shown to rapidly modulate O-GlcNAcylation of several proteins in response to chemotactic agents. Recently, changes in O-GlcNAc cycling have been shown in response to cellular stress, the cell cycle, developmental stages, neuron depolarization, nutrient sensing, and insulin signaling. Pulse-chase analyses have revealed that O-GlcNAc residues on small heat-shock protein in the lens (α-crystallin) and on intermediate filament proteins (cytokeratins) turn over more rapidly than the polypeptide chains to which they are attached. These observations suggest that O-GlcNAc is a regulatory posttranslational modification analogous to phosphorylation. To date, nucleocytoplasmic O-β-GlcNAc has been found in all multicellular organisms investigated, ranging from filamentous fungi, worms, insects, and plants to humans. However, to date no OGA ortholog has been identified in plants or protozoans. Plants encode two OGT paralogs: SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPY. Curiously, whereas SEC encodes an O-GlcNAc transferase, SPY encodes a fucosyltransferase. Notably, the SPY paralog in Dictyostelium discoideum, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Toxoplasma gondii also fucosylates proteins. To date, O-GlcNAc and the enzymes that control its cycling do not appear to exist in yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. However, recently, it was discovered that S. cerevisiae have O-mannose moieties on the same proteins and at the same sites on which O-GlcNAc is found in multicellular organisms. Recent data suggest that the O-GlcNAc modification is also found in a subset of prokaryotes, such as Listeria monocytogenes. It is currently unclear if the enzymes responsible for this modification are related to OGT or EOGT. O-GlcNAc-modified proteins have also been found on many viruses that infect metazoans (e.g., adenovirus, SV40, cytomegalovirus, rotavirus, baculovirus, plum pox, HIV, and others). In viruses, instead of being localized on the outside capsid of the virus in which “classical” N- or O-glycans are found (Chapter 42), O-GlcNAc is found deep within the viruses, on tegument and other regulatory proteins, close to the nucleic acid components. Genetic and subsequent biochemical studies in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that the gene SEC regulates growth hormone (gibberellic acid) signaling, and later studies established that SEC encodes an O-β-GlcNAc transferase. Mutations in SEC cause severe growth phenotypes, but they are not lethal. Interestingly, simultaneous mutation of SEC and the paralogous SPY gene, which encodes an OGT-related fucosyltransferase, is lethal. Studies in rice, potatoes, and other plants have also indicated that O-GlcNAcylation is important for growth regulation. Mammals and insects appear to have only a single gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the OGT.'
 'Mutations in SEC cause severe growth phenotypes, but they are not lethal. Interestingly, simultaneous mutation of SEC and the paralogous SPY gene, which encodes an OGT-related fucosyltransferase, is lethal. Studies in rice, potatoes, and other plants have also indicated that O-GlcNAcylation is important for growth regulation. Mammals and insects appear to have only a single gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the OGT. Using Cre-LoxP conditional gene disruption in mice, OGT was shown to be required for the viability of embryonic stem cells. Tissue-targeted disruption in mice and disruption of OGT expression in cell culture have established that O-GlcNAcylation is essential for viability at the single-cell level in many mammalian cell types. Disruption of OGT in the worm C. elegans causes defective carbohydrate metabolism, abnormalities in dauer formation, and reduced life span. In Drosophila, homozygous mutants in the OGT ortholog super sex combs survive for >5 days until the late larval stage, but subsequently die in the pupal cases. Targeted, inducible deletion of OGT in αCAMKII-positive (excitatory) neurons in brains of adult mice results in morbidly obese mice because of defects in satiety, further supporting the roles of O-GlcNAcylation as a nutrient sensor. The highly homologous and conserved nature of OGT among metazoans allows a transgene encoding the human sequence of OGT to be used to rescue OGT null Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, OGA has been disrupted in both C. elegans and mammalian models. Like the OGT null, the C. elegans OGA null has defective carbohydrate metabolism and abnormalities in dauer formation. In contrast to the OGT null, in C. elegans in which OGA has been disrupted, the worms have an extended life span. In murine models, deletion of OGA leads to perinatal lethality, genomic instability and severe epigenetic and metabolic phenotypes. The OGA heterozygous mouse shows widespread changes in transcription and metabolism, and an enhanced dependence on glucose metabolism. Studies from numerous laboratories have described O-GlcNAcylated proteins from virtually all cellular compartments, representing nearly all functional classes of protein (Figure 19.2; Table 19.1). Indeed, recent databases contain more than 6,000 O-GlcNAcylated proteins with more than 7,000 sites mapped (O-GlcNAcAtlas; The O-GlcNAc Database). O-GlcNAc is particularly abundant within the nucleus, in which it occurs on the transcriptional regulatory machinery, including the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II catalytic subunit and basal, as well as other, transcription factors, histones, chromatin-modifying proteins, mRNA biogenesis proteins, and DNA methyltransferases. O-GlcNAcylation also appears to be particularly abundant on proteins involved in signaling, stress responses, and energy metabolism. Nearly 90 proteins within the mitochondria are dynamically O-GlcNAcylated, with the highest concentration found within the electron transport chain. O-GlcNAc also occurs on many cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, such as those regulating actin assembly (e.g., vinculin, talin, vimentin, and ankyrin) and tubulin assembly (e.g., MAPs, dynein, and tau). Even α-tubulin itself is dynamically modified by O-GlcNAc, but the stoichiometry appears to be low. Intermediate filaments, such as cytokeratins and neurofilaments in brain, are also heavily modified by O-GlcNAc. Site-mapping studies have shown that protein kinases and OGT can often modify the same serine and threonine residues, suggesting that a complex interplay exists between these two posttranslational modifications that fine-tunes signal transduction networks. In fact, major enzymes that remove O-phosphate, protein phosphatase 1 β and γ, are in a dynamic complex with OGT, suggesting that in many cases the same enzyme complex both removes O-phosphate and concomitantly attaches O-GlcNAc (Figure 19.1).'
 'The enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to EGF repeats (EOGT) is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is closely related to the enzymes that catalyze mucin-like glycosylation, but not the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT; catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc). Unlike intracellular O-GlcNAcylation, modification of EGF repeats by O-GlcNAc is static and can be extended by the addition of galactose. Recent studies show that O-GlcNAc is found on thousands of nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic proteins, including many heavily studied proteins such as RNA polymerase II, histones, and ribosomal proteins (Figure 19.2; Table 19.1). Yet, although phosphorylation was discovered in 1954, O-GlcNAc was not discovered until 1983. So why did O-GlcNAc remain undetected for so long? First, the long-standing dogma was that glycosylation (other than glycogen storage) did not occur with the nucleocytosolic compartment. Second, unlike charged modifications (e.g., phosphate), addition and removal of O-GlcNAc generally does not affect the migration of polypeptides on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). A small shift in protein migration might be seen if the O-GlcNAc residues are highly clustered or if the protein is extensively O-GlcNAcylated at multiple sites (e.g., p62 nuclear pore protein). Third, all cells contain high levels of hydrolases, including abundant lysosomal hexosaminidases and nucleocytoplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, that rapidly remove O-GlcNAc from intracellular proteins when the cell is damaged or lysed. Thus, O-GlcNAc is often lost during the isolation of a protein. Finally, O-GlcNAc is particularly difficult to detect by physical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, because it often occurs at substoichiometric amounts on a protein and is readily lost during the ionization process in a mass spectrometer. In both electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses of a mixture of unmodified and O-GlcNAc-modified peptides, not only is the O-GlcNAc lost during ionization but the signal from the O-GlcNAc-modified peptides that remain is suppressed by the presence of the unmodified peptide. Our ability to detect O-GlcNAc has been improved in recent years by the development of monoclonal antibodies, lectins and mutant glycoside hydrolases that bind O-GlcNAc, the use of “click chemistry” compatible sugars (Chapters 51 and 56), and the invention of more sophisticated mass spectrometric techniques, such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry. In mammals, the dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc on proteins is regulated by the concerted actions of enzymes encoded by just two genes: OGT and a neutral β-hexosaminidase known as O-GlcNAcase (OGA) (Figure 19.1). The regulation of the transcription start site and alternative splicing results in the synthesis of at least three isoforms of OGT and two isoforms of OGA. Nonetheless, the question remains: “How can so few enzymes specifically glycosylate and deglycosylate so many substrates?” Although both OGT and OGA each have only a single catalytic subunit, they actually exist within the cell as a multitude of different holoenzymes in which their catalytic subunits are noncovalently bound to a myriad of accessory proteins that appear to control their targeting (Figure 19.3). In addition, both OGT and OGA are modified by both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation. Functions for some of these posttranslational modifications have been identified, including substrate targeting, altering protein localization, and altering specific activity.']","OGA was purified from rat kidney and bovine brain, and the human gene was cloned using peptide sequence information. The OGA gene was found to be identical to MGEA5, a putative hyaluronidase genetically identified because of its association with meningiomas. There are two well-characterized isoforms of OGA (short and full-length), which appear to arise from alternative splicing. Short OGA is identical to full-length OGA for the first 662 amino acids but possesses an alternative carboxy-terminal sequence 15 amino acids in length. Sequence and structural analyses reveal that OGA contains an amino-terminal hexosaminidase domain and a carboxy-terminal domain, with homology to GCN5 histone acetyltransferases (HAT), separated by an intervening sequence. OGA forms an unusual arm-in-arm homodimer that is mediated by a helix within the intervening sequence. Dimerization is critical for activity and the formation of a substrate binding cleft.","Short OGA is identical to full-length OGA (916 amino acids) for the first 662 amino acids but possesses an alternative carboxy-terminal sequence 15 amino acids in length.

"Complete the following paragraph: Giant viruses such as the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough that they can express their own glycosylation machineries. On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors.","['To protect its own genome, the phage modifies its DNA by replacing cytosine with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and subsequently transferring glucose (Glc) to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine using a specific UDP-Glc:DNA Glc-transferase. The baculovirus enzyme ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase (EGT) disrupts the hormonal balance of the insect host by catalyzing the conjugation of ecdysteroid hormones with Glc or galactose (Gal). Expression of the EGT gene allows the virus to block molting and pupation of infected insect larvae. Similarly, Chloroviruses have enzymes in CAZy family GT4 for the glycosylation of their structural proteins. Serotype conversion in Shigella flexneri is mediated by temperate bacteriophages, which encode GTs that mediate O-antigen conversion by the addition of Glc to O-antigen units. Finally, giant viruses such as Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus encode 12 putative GTs for the synthesis of complex O-glycans. Bacterial GTs play a major role in their symbiosis and virulence. Some bacteria such as Campylobacter are able to N-glycosylate their proteins, but the most universal role for bacterial glycosylation is in the synthesis of cell-wall peptidoglycan, simple glycolipids, lipopolysaccharides, and complex exopolysaccharides (Chapter 21). The GTs involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis are GT28 MurG, which adds N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to undecaprenyl diphospho-N-MurNAc, and GT51 MtgA, which polymerizes undecaprenyl diphospho-MurNAc-GlcNAc. Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces an extremely complex envelope that includes all of the above. In bacteria, the role of these glycans is to provide a barrier that affords mechanical, chemical, and biological protection to the cell. Some pathogenic or commensal bacteria produce an outer glycan layer that mimics that of their hosts, in order to evade host immune surveillance (Chapters 15 and 42). Pasteurella multocida produces a thick hyaluronan capsule. Oral streptococci produce two GTs for adhesion and virulence, and the EPax GT enables colonization of the gut by Enterococcus faecalis. Other pathogens such as Escherichia coli K1 and Neisseria meningitidis produce a poly α2–8 sialic acid capsule. Mammalian gut bacteria produce capsular polysaccharides thought to help the maturation of the host immune system. Archaea devote ∼1% of their genes to GTs but, on average, devote only 0.25% to GHs, and there is almost no correlation with the number of GH genes and the overall number of genes. Surprisingly, ∼20% of sequenced archaeal genomes appear to be completely devoid of GHs. The most striking example is Methanosphaera stadtmanae, whose genome encodes at least 43 GTs but apparently no GHs. This is not due to sequence divergence, because GHs are readily detected in some Archaea. These observations suggest that (1) horizontal transfer is likely the determining factor behind archaeal GH repertoires, and (2) the Archaea in question do not recycle glycosidic bonds elaborated by their own GTs. Although they do not make peptidoglycans like bacteria, Archaea use nucleotide-activated oligosaccharides to produce a variety of extracellular polysaccharides such as the heteropolysaccharide “methanochondroitin” made by Methanosarcina barkeri, which resembles eukaryotic chondroitin sulfate (Chapter 17). Archaea also make glycophospholipids and one relevant GT is GDP-Glc:glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase from family GT81 in Methanococcoides burtonii. In CAZy family GT55, there are several archaeal GDP-Man:mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthases.'
 'Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution. Viruses typically have minimalist genomes and use host-cell machinery for replication. Thus, glycosylation of enveloped viruses reflects that of the host. However, there are exceptions. Giant viruses such as the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough that they can express their own glycosylation machineries. On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors. For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide. In this regard, it has been suggested that the high frequency of heterozygous states for human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 44) may reflect selection for genomes that limit glycosylation of invading viruses. Host lectins may also be “hijacked” by glycans on viral surface glycoproteins. For example, Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1; Chapter 15) is used by the heavily sialylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to gain entry into macrophages. Viral protein sequence can also influence host glycosylation (e.g., by structural constraints on access for glycosyltransferases or hydrolases), in a manner that favors viral antigenicity, such as the high-mannose N-glycans on HIV-1 envelope gp120 trimers. Despite the enormous potential for structural diversity, a rather limited subset of all possible monosaccharides and their possible linkages and modifications are found in eukaryotic cells. Why one encounters only such a limited subset of the possible glycan structures is a puzzling question. Could there be trade-offs between the variety of glycan structures and the additional resources, such as energy and biosynthetic pathways, that cells/organisms need in order to maintain that variety? Or maybe the variety of structures is limited by a combination of positive and negative selection due to both, its intrinsic functions and interactions with symbionts and pathogens? Regardless, this limited subset has allowed better elucidation of structures of eukaryotic glycans. In contrast, Bacteria and Archaea have had several billion additional years to respond to selective pressure from pathogens; in particular, phages. These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow. Glycosylation in Bacteria and Archaea is far more diverse, both in terms of the range of monosaccharides used or synthesized, and in the types of linkages and modifications (Chapters 21 and 22). In addition, prokaryotic cell–cell interactions both within and between species are often mediated by glycans. However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity.'
 'Knowledge of the ligand specificity of a GBP is required to assign in vivo functions. In cases in which there is a dearth of information, rational predictions based on the framework and sequence of existing carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) have been found useful. Legume lectins represent a class of GBPs identified decades ago that continues to provide perhaps the best model for protein–glycan recognition. Moreover, discovery of the legume lectin fold (jelly-roll motif) in mammalian lectins, such as galectins (Chapter 36), calnexin, and calreticulin (Chapter 34), highlights the preeminence of this fold in carbohydrate recognition across phylogeny. Earlier work in the identification of monosaccharide-binding specificities of legume lectins provided the framework for finding their relatives in all forms of life (Chapter 32). This approach led to the assignment of glycan specificities for proteins involved in the sorting of vesicular compartments and in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments of mammalian cells (Chapter 39). Of similar importance is the discovery of new galectins in the galectin-10 family and galectin-like proteins in genome databases using similarity searches (Chapter 36). Likewise, Siglecs, a family of sialic acid–binding I-type lectins involved in regulating multiple biological responses (Chapter 35), show signature sequence motifs, and 17 members have been identified in primates to date. It is important to note that the mere presence of a CRD does not necessarily translate into functional glycan-recognizing activity. This is because sequence motifs used to identify CRDs are often found in a functionally inactive, lectin-like, CRD fold (Chapter 34). Glycan microarrays provide a high-throughput means of detecting the interactions of GBPs with the diverse oligosaccharide sequences of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and polysaccharides (Chapter 30). The use of glass slides, microarray printing technology, and surface patterning of engineered glycophages displaying unique carbohydrate epitopes allows the production of glycan microarrays with the potential to examine binding of all types of GBPs (lectins, antiglycan monoclonal or serum antibodies, and glycan-binding cytokines or chemokines) to several thousand unique glycans, simultaneously. Binding is assessed by fluorescent or spectrometric techniques. Glycan microarray data are provided by resources such as the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics/publicdata/primaryscreen.jsp) and the Imperial College Microarray Data Online Portal (https://glycosciences.med.ic.ac.uk/data.html), and several analysis software packages, including GLAD (https://glycotoolkit.com/GLAD/), MotifFinder (https://haablab.vai.org/tools/), MCAW (https://mcawdb.glycoinfo.org/) and CCARL (https://github.com/andrewguy/CCARL). Note that arrays that use different linkers and/or different attachment chemistries can give quite variable results, and the results need to be evaluated in the context of natural binding phenomena. It has long been known that many viruses use host glycans as specific binding receptors for entering the cell (Chapter 37). Similarly, several viruses encode lytic enzymes that break down host cell surface glycans to release viral particles after viral replication. Genome sequencing reveals that many double-stranded DNA viruses also take advantage by adding sugars to host glycoproteins through the use of viral GTs (Chapter 42). Although biological roles of viral GTs are poorly understood, some functions have been identified. For example, the T4 bacteriophage encodes nucleases that degrade host cell DNA. To protect its own genome, the phage modifies its DNA by replacing cytosine with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and subsequently transferring glucose (Glc) to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine using a specific UDP-Glc:DNA Glc-transferase. The baculovirus enzyme ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase (EGT) disrupts the hormonal balance of the insect host by catalyzing the conjugation of ecdysteroid hormones with Glc or galactose (Gal).'
 'These secreted toxins show the remarkable ability of translocating across the surface membrane into the cytoplasm of mammalian target cells. The enterotoxins from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) and Clostridium sordellii are α-glucosyltransferases from CAZy family GT44 that use UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) as the donor. In contrast, a similar toxin from Clostridium novyi is an O-αGlcNAc transferase that uses UDP-GlcNAc as the donor. The C. novyi toxin has no primary sequence relationship to host glycosyltransferases. A distantly related toxin from Legionella pneumophila, also delivered by a type IV secretion system, installs an αGlc residue on elongation factor 1A in a broad range of eukaryotic host cells. The target residue, Ser53, is located in the G domain near the switch-1 region of the GTPase, and glucosylation inhibits its activity in vitro and in vivo. The recent discovery of a new effector glucosyltransferase, LtpM, shows that this is an expanding field of glycosyltransferase discovery. Interestingly, an unrelated toxin from Yersinia, which enters host cells via a phage tail-derived translocation system, was found to be an αGlcNAc-transferase that modifies Tyr-34 of RhoA. Typically, the sugar–amino acid linkage is not recognized by endogenous glycosidases, allowing the pathogen to irreversibly alter the function of the target—typically a GTPase domain. Other Gram-negative bacteria use a type 3 secretion system to inject virulence factors that mediate a different form of monoglycosylation: GlcNAcα-Arg. This novel reaction is catalyzed by NleB-related glycosyltransferases that promote host-cell longevity during infection. NleB and NleB orthologs target arginine side-chains within death domains of death receptors and associated proteins TRADD, FADD, RIPK1, and TNFR1. Importantly, these factors all work to attenuate NF-κB signaling to dampen host-cell antibacterial and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, various components of glucose metabolism such as GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and HIF-1α are also targeted to reduced NF-κB signaling. Although these examples involve monoglycosylation mediated by exogenous glycosyltransferases (see Table 18.1), their existence reinforces the potential impact of glycosylation as a regulatory mechanism, and the diversity of glycosylation events that probably remain to be discovered. Although the focus of this chapter is on nuclear and cytoplasmic glycoproteins, it should be noted that specific bases in DNA have long been known to be a target of bacteriophage-encoded glycosyltransferases. Modification of T4-phage DNA hydroxymethylcytosine residues by βGlcTs or αGlcTs (Table 18.1) aids in the distinction of native and foreign DNA, rendering them resistant to host restriction enzyme digestion and impairing a subset of CRISPR/Cas systems. The use of Glc disaccharide, arabinose, and other sugar modifications of bases suggests that the full diversity of sugar modifications remains to be described. A related modification occurs in a protist, Trypanosoma brucei, in the form of base J. Using a mechanism resembling Skp1 glycosylation (vide infra), DNA thymidine residues are initially hydroxylated by an O2-dependent nonheme dioxygenase generating hydroxymethyl moieties suitable for glycosylation by a novel nuclear β-glucosyltransferase, JGT, a CAZy GT2 glycosyltransferase (Table 18.1). Base J influences Pol II termination by recruiting a complex containing protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate RNA polymerase II. Disruption in complex formation affects polycistronic transcription termination in the wider group of kinetoplastids. Complex glycans, consisting of more than a single sugar, have also been reported in the nucleocytoplasmic compartment (Figure 18.1B).'
 'Influenza-C virions (and many coronaviruses) contain a single “hemagglutinin-esterase” that possesses both hemagglutinin and receptor-destroying activities, which in this case is an esterase that cleaves the 9-O-acetyl group from the target O-acetylated sialic acid receptors (Table 37.1). Some coronaviruses have evolved to adapt the spike “S” proteins to target O-acetylated sialic acid receptors. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has completely lost its hemagglutinin-esterase protein, but encodes an S protein that has evolved further, to bind more robustly to heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which can also act as a cofactor facilitating binding to a high-affinity protein receptor ACE2. Rotaviruses, the major killer of children worldwide, can also bind to sialic acid residues. These viruses only bind to the intestinal epithelium of newborn infants during a period that appears to correlate with the expression of specific types and arrangements of sialic acids on glycoproteins. Claims regarding “sialic acid–independent” rotaviruses may be explained by internal sialic acids resistant to bacterial sialidases. Many other viruses (e.g., adenovirus, reovirus, Sendai virus, and polyomavirus) also use sialic acids for infection, and crystal structures are now available for several of their sialic acid–binding domains. A number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), foot-and-mouth disease virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and dengue flavivirus, use heparan sulfate proteoglycans as adhesion receptors (Table 37.1). In many cases, the proteoglycans may be part of a coreceptor system in which viruses make initial contact with a cell-surface proteoglycan and later with another receptor. For example, HSV infection is thought to initially involve the binding of viral glycoproteins gB and/or gC to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Glycoprotein gB promotes virus-cell fusion, syncytium formation (cell–cell fusion), and adherence, whereas gC binds to the C3b component of complement and blocks complement-mediated inhibition of the virus. These events are followed by HSV glycoprotein gD binding to one of several cell-surface receptors, including protein receptors and heparan sulfate, ultimately leading to fusion of the viral envelope with the host-cell plasma membrane. Interestingly, the interaction of gD with heparan sulfate shows specificity for a particular substructure in heparan sulfate containing a 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residue, the formation of which is catalyzed by specific isozymes of the glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase gene family. Thus, the heparan sulfate–binding adhesins appear to recognize carbohydrate units within the polysaccharide chains as opposed to binding terminal sugars. Dengue flavivirus, the causative agent of dengue hemorrhagic fever, also binds to heparan sulfate. Computational modeling to compare the primary dengue viral envelope protein sequence with the crystal structure of a related virion envelope protein suggests that the heparan sulfate–binding site may lie along a positively charged amino acid groove (Figure 37.2). The recently emerging Zika virus belongs to the same family. Furthermore, HIV can bind heparan sulfate and other sulfated polysaccharides by way of the V3 loop of its gp120 glycoprotein.

Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity.']","This paragraph highlights that giant viruses like the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough to independently express their glycosylation machineries. Additionally, specific viruses utilize glycosyltransferases as virulence factors, showcasing the diverse strategies employed by viruses in manipulating host-cell interactions through glycosylation mechanisms.","For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide. In this regard, it has been suggested that the high frequency of heterozygous states for human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 44) may reflect selection for genomes that limit glycosylation of invading viruses.",0.75,0.6502813266971827,0.701398801110661,0.017391304347826087,0.99999999998,1.0
"Complete the following paragraph: Although the focus of this chapter is on the glycobiology of bacterial cell envelopes, there are several additional (and equally important) facets of bacterial glycobiology. Three of these are briefly mentioned here.","['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.21 Chris Whitfield, Christine M. Szymanski, Amanda L. Lewis, and Markus Aebi. Glycoconjugates are integral components of the cell surfaces of bacteria and are often the immediate point of contact with the environment. Surface glycoconjugates contribute to the essential permeability barrier properties of the cell envelope, influence both the susceptibility and resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and other harmful compounds, participate in the formation and dispersion of biofilms, act as receptors for bacteriophages, and play pivotal roles in pathogenic and symbiotic host–microbe interactions. Reflecting these many functions, surface glycoconjugates are remarkably diverse, enabled by the propensity for bacterial genetic recombination and lateral gene transfer and shaped by environmental interactions that impart niche-specific selective pressures. Surface glycoconjugates drive a variety of important interactions with host innate and adaptive immune defenses. Some are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), for example, via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways. Others are natural targets of adaptive immunity and have been exploited in successful vaccine strategies. Because of their importance in cell viability, surface glycoconjugates are also frequent targets of antimicrobial strategies. This chapter will provide an overview of the structure and biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, together with some examples of their functions. Bacteria were historically divided into two major groups based on their response in the Gram-staining procedure (i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms), reflecting the organization of the cell wall. The amount and location of peptidoglycan in the cell wall is an important contributor to the outcome of Gram staining. Peptidoglycan is essential for the viability of most bacteria. It consists of polysaccharide strands covalently cross-linked by short peptides, creating a three-dimensional structure that confers shape and rigidity to the cell. In Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the cell wall consists of two membranes separated by a cellular compartment termed the periplasm in which thin layers of peptidoglycan reside (Figure 21.1). In Gram-positive bacteria, substantially thicker layers of peptidoglycan surround a single membrane and provide an attachment point for other glycan structures. Another class of bacteria, the Negativicutes, are related to the Gram-positive Firmicutes but nevertheless have a two-membrane architecture and stain as Gram-negative. Other bacteria produce variable responses in the Gram-staining reaction, largely because of the presence of other glycans and cell wall lipids (see below). Conceptual organization of the cell envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and mycobacteria. The schematic comparison of the cell walls (or cell envelopes) of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and mycobacteria illustrates (more...) The periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria contains proteins associated with cell-surface assembly and nutrient uptake but may also contain free oligosaccharides (fOS) that protect against osmotic stress. The outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with an outer leaflet composed mainly of a unique glycolipid called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is essential for the integrity of the permeability barrier imposed by the outer membrane. Many Gram-negative bacteria are covered in a surface-bound polysaccharide layer known as a capsule, and, in some cases, this capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is released from the cell in large amounts as free exopolysaccharide (EPS). Bacteria producing these products are often readily identified by their highly mucoid colonies. Structural variations in the LPS and capsules of different bacterial species are diverse and influence many types of interactions between bacteria and their environmental and host niches. Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane (Figure 21.1) and depend on a much thicker multilayered peptidoglycan layer for viability.'
 'Within the biofilm, a combination of the protected environment and altered cell physiology can help protect bacteria from some antimicrobial compounds. Some bacteria may produce multiple EPSs that contribute to biofilms, and their precise structures may be critical for creation of a proper biofilm architecture, as in Pseudomonas. Certain glycan structures appear well adapted to roles in biofilm communities and are, therefore, more widely distributed. Many biofilm-forming bacteria produce PNAG, also known as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin, with this being targeted by small-molecule inhibitor and vaccine strategies to eradicate biofilm bacteria (Figure 21.6). Assembly systems for CPSs and EPSs are broadly divided into three mechanisms that are distinguished (in part) by the nature of the acceptor on which they are built (Figure 21.6). A large variety of CPSs and EPSs use undecaprenol diphosphate-linked intermediates and follow a synthetic pathway indistinguishable from that used by Wzx/Wzy-dependent O-antigens, described above. In fact, some bacteria produce O-antigens and CPSs/EPSs with the same structures. The CPS shares the same early steps in the pathway but instead of ligating the product to lipid A-core, a CPS-dedicated export machinery spanning the periplasm and outer membrane is used. The features that distinguish CPSs and EPSs in this type of assembly process are unknown. In Gram-positive bacteria with Wzx/Wzy-dependent processes, the nascent polysaccharide is then either released as an EPS or transferred from undecaprenol and attached to peptidoglycam, often via a phosphodiester linkage to MurNAc residues. In Streptococci, this may be catalyzed by an enzyme related to those that link WTAs to the same site in peptidoglycan. Several Gram-negative bacteria assemble CPSs using a conserved phosphatidylglycerol-(Kdo)n acceptor. Although prototypes are found in E. coli and N. meningitidis, the system is conserved across a range of mucosal pathogens. Here, polymerization of the lipid-linked glycan is completed in the cytoplasm, after which it is exported via an ABC transporter. The transporter is linked to additional proteins that span the periplasm and outer membrane in a configuration thought to resemble certain drug efflux pumps in bacteria. The final assembly pathway seems to operate independently of a lipid carrier and requires a processive polymerase called a synthase. Examples are found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but seem to be confined to EPSs. The prototypical hyaluronan and cellulose synthases from Streptococci and Gram-negative bacteria show different architectures, yet both are sufficient for both synthesis and export across the cytoplasmic membrane. The molecular details underlying these processes have been resolved by analysis of the crystal structure of the cellulose synthase. In Gram-negative bacteria, a periplasmic scaffold links the synthase to an outer membrane protein channel. Although the focus of this chapter is on the glycobiology of bacterial cell envelopes, there are several additional (and equally important) facets of bacterial glycobiology. Three of these are briefly mentioned here. First, in addition to synthesizing surface structures, bacteria also produce intracellular glycans and cytoplasmic glycosylated proteins and glycolipids. For example, glycogen and trehalose act as storage compounds within some bacteria. Mycobacteria also contain a growing list of unusual glycosylated molecules, which may be related to their ability to withstand a variety of stresses. Second, bacteria produce a wide range of glycan-binding proteins. These include adhesins that facilitate bacterial colonization, exotoxins that bind to host membrane glycans, and single-sugar-binding proteins involved in metabolism (see Chapter 42). Third, bacterial lifestyles are often defined by their capacity to digest and/or metabolize glycans. Complex nanomachines have been described for the degradation of complex carbohydrate structures. Assembling the various enzymes into a highly organized complex affords synergy and efficiency. For example, the roles of glycosyl hydrolases in biomass conversion are well documented (Chapter 59).

Assembling the various enzymes into a highly organized complex affords synergy and efficiency. For example, the roles of glycosyl hydrolases in biomass conversion are well documented (Chapter 59). The cellulose degradation machinery in Clostridioides sp. and other organisms comprises a suite of glycosidases and carbohydrate-binding modules, all assembled into a single surface complex (the cellulosome) via noncatalytic cohesin and dockerin structural modules. Within the gut microbiome, Bacteroidetes encode a remarkable array of carbohydrate-active enzymes in polysaccharide utilization loci, allowing them to adapt to dietary changes by sensing, binding, and degrading different complex substrates, followed by import of the products for catabolism. Indeed, bacteria within the many biomes of the human body derive benefit from foraging, not only on plant polysaccharides, but also on host-derived mucosal glycans. We continue to learn more about the intricate pathways for the digestion, capture, and catabolism of environmental and host carbohydrates.

 'Bacteria producing these products are often readily identified by their highly mucoid colonies. Structural variations in the LPS and capsules of different bacterial species are diverse and influence many types of interactions between bacteria and their environmental and host niches. Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane (Figure 21.1) and depend on a much thicker multilayered peptidoglycan layer for viability. The Gram-positive cell wall is modified with additional specialized cell wall glycan polymers covalently linked to peptidoglycan (e.g., wall teichoic acids [WTAs]), whereas glycolipids, such as lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), are anchored in the cell membrance. Mycobacteria and related Actinobacteria are not considered to be Gram-positive or Gram-negative, and are instead classified as acid-fast bacteria because they possess distinctive cell walls that confer an aberrant response to the classical Gram-staining procedure. Their complex cell walls have a high content of remarkable glycan and glycolipid structures (Figure 21.1). The unique arabinogalactan (AG) component that characterizes these organisms is covalently attached to peptidoglycan and provides an attachment point for characteristic long-chain (C60–C90) α-alkyl-β-hydroxymycolic acids. The resulting mycolyl-AG-peptidoglycan complex underpins a permeability barrier conferring resistance to antibiotics and other harmful molecules. Mycolic acids help form an envelope layer referred to as an “outer membrane,” although its structure shares no similarity with its namesake in Gram-negative bacteria. Peptidoglycan (also known as murein) forms a rigid sacculus enveloping the cytoplasmic membrane, conferring cell shape, and contributing to the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of internal osmotic (turgor) pressure. Although most bacteria possess peptidoglycan, it is absent in some obligate intracellular pathogens, such as Mycoplasma sp., and can be conditionally expendable in certain bacteria that produce L-forms. Given its distribution, peptidoglycan is recognized by host defenses as a marker of infection. Released peptidoglycan is a PAMP recognized by TLR2 and pattern recognition proteins, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), to activate an inflammatory response as part of innate immunity. Peptidoglycan makes up ∼10% of the dry weight of the cell wall in Gram-negative bacteria, in which it exists in a structure one to three layers thick. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria have a thicker cell wall containing 10 to 20 layers of peptidoglycan, representing as much as 20%–25% of the dry weight of the cell. The overall chemical structure of peptidoglycan is similar across bacterial genera (Figure 21.2) and consists of parallel strands of polysaccharides composed of a β1-4-linked disaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). The average chain length of the glycan strands in E. coli is 25–35 disaccharide units but may increase several-fold in Gram-positive bacteria. Adjacent strands are connected to one another via cross-links between short peptide strands attached to the MurNAc residues (Figure 21.2). Individual glycan strands are thought to be arranged parallel to the membrane and the helical conformation of the glycan strands enables cross-linking in three dimensions, within and between layers, to create the functional higher-order structure. Although the amino acid composition varies in different bacteria, the peptides are typically composed of L-Ala, unusual D-amino acids (e.g., D-Glu and D-Ala) and a dibasic amino acid, such as meso-diaminopimelic acid (m-A2pm or m-DAP) or L-Lys, to facilitate the cross-linking. Cross-links may be direct peptide bonds or (in some Gram-positive bacteria) include several amino acids, such as Gly5. This, and the frequency of cross-linking, will have spatial implications for the final meshwork.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.1 Ajit Varki and Stuart Kornfeld. This chapter provides a historical background to the field of glycobiology and an overview of this book. General terms found in the volume are considered, common monosaccharide units of glycoconjugates mentioned, and a uniform symbol nomenclature used for structural depictions presented. The major glycan classes discussed in the book are described, and an overview of the general pathways for their biosynthesis is provided. Topological issues relevant to biosynthesis and functions of glycoconjugates are also considered, and the growing role of these molecules in medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioenergy, and materials science is mentioned. Defined in the broadest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (also called carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature and of the proteins that recognize them. How does glycobiology fit into the modern concepts of molecular biology? The central paradigm driving research in molecular biology has been that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The power of this concept lies in its template-based precision, the ability to manipulate one class of molecules based on knowledge of another, and the patterns of sequence homology and relatedness that predict function and reveal evolutionary relationships. With ongoing sequencing of numerous genomes, spectacular gains in understanding the biology of nucleic acids and proteins have occurred. Thus, many scientists assume that studying just these molecules will explain the makeup of cells, tissues, organs, physiological systems, and intact organisms. In fact, making a cell requires many small molecule metabolites as well as two other major classes of macromolecules—lipids and carbohydrates—which serve as intermediates in generating energy and as signaling effectors, recognition markers, and structural components. Taken together with the fact that they encompass some of the major posttranslational modifications of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates help explain how the relatively small number of genes in the typical genome can generate the enormous biological complexities inherent in the development, growth, and functioning of diverse organisms. The biological roles of carbohydrates are particularly prominent in the assembly of complex multicellular organs and organisms, which requires interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix. However, without any known exception, all cells and numerous macromolecules in nature carry an array of covalently attached sugars (monosaccharides) or sugar chains (oligosaccharides), which are generically referred to in this book as “glycans.” Sometimes glycans can also be freestanding entities. Being on the outer surface of cellular and secreted macromolecules, many glycans are in a position to modulate or mediate a variety of events in cell–cell, cell–matrix, and cell–molecule interactions critical to the development and function of a complex multicellular organism. They can also mediate interactions between organisms (e.g., between host and a parasite, pathogen, or a symbiont). In addition, simple, rapidly turning over, protein-bound glycans are abundant within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in which they can serve as regulatory switches. A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids). In analogy to the current situation in Cosmology, glycans can be considered as the “dark matter” of the biological universe: a major and critical component that has yet to be fully incorporated into the “standard model” of biology. However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities.']","In addition to synthesizing surface structures, bacteria also produce intracellular glycans and cytoplasmic glycosylated proteins and glycolipids.

"Complete the following paragraph: In comparison to N-glycan biosynthesis, relatively little is known of how archaeal O-glycans are assembled. The O-glycans of four archaeal species have been characterized to a limited extent (Figure 22.3). The only published report on archaeal O-glycan biosynthesis revealed that Haloarcula hispanica requires Dol-P-Glc as a sugar donor for the assembly of the N-linked glucose-α-(1,2)-[sulfoquinovosamine-β-(1,6)-]galactose trisaccharide and the O-linked glucose-α-(1,4)-galactose disaccharide.","['It was later reported that the major M. maripaludis pilin is modified by the same N-linked tetrasaccharide bearing an extra hexose branching from the linking GalNAc subunit. The pathway used for N-glycosylation of M. mariplaudis archaellin has been largely delineated. The process seemingly starts with the addition of UDP-GalNAc to Dol-P by an unidentified glycosyltransferase. Like Hfx. volcanii Dol-P, M. mariplaudis Dol-P includes two saturated isoprenes, likely at the α and ω positions. The AglO, AglA, and AglL glycosyltransferases add the next three nucleotide-activated sugars, respectively. AglU adds the threonine moiety to sugar three, apparently only following the addition of the fourth sugar by the glycosyltransferase AglL. AglV then methylates sugar four. The Dol-P-bound tetrasaccharide is then flipped across the membrane by an unidentified flippase, where AglB transfers the lipid-linked glycan to target Asn residues. Studies on the N-glycosylation process in Crenarchaeota have focused on the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In S. acidocaldarius, the S-layer glycoprotein, archaellin, and cytochrome b558/566 are modified by an N-linked hexasaccharide with the structure (Man-α1-6)(Man-α1-4)(Glc-β1-4-Qui6S-β1-3)GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-β-Asn. This glycan is unusual as it contains the typical eukaryotic chitobiose core and a sulfoquinovose, a sugar generally found only in photosynthetic membranes of plants and phototrophic bacteria. Biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan begins with the transfer of GlcNAc-phosphate, derived from a nucleotide-activated precursor, onto an unusually short and highly saturated Dol-PP lipid carrier by AglH, a UDP-GlcNAc-1-P: Dol-P-GlcNAc-1-P transferase. Information concerning addition of the second and third sugars is lacking. However, Agl3 converts UDP-glucose and sodium sulphite into UDP-sulfoquinovose, which is subsequently added to Dol-PP-bound trisaccharide by an unknown glycosyltransferase. In the final steps of N-linked glycan assembly, the terminal mannose and glucose moieties are added, with Agl16, a soluble glycosyltransferase, adding the final glucose. A so-far unidentified flippase translocates the Dol-PP-bound hexasaccharide across the membrane, where AglB transfers the glycan to target protein Asn residues. In contrast to Hfx. volcanii, M. voltae, and M. maripaludis, aglB is essential in S. acidocaldarius. In comparison to N-glycan biosynthesis, relatively little is known of how archaeal O-glycans are assembled. The O-glycans of four archaeal species have been characterized to a limited extent (Figure 22.3). The only published report on archaeal O-glycan biosynthesis revealed that Haloarcula hispanica requires Dol-P-Glc as a sugar donor for the assembly of the N-linked glucose-α-(1,2)-[sulfoquinovosamine-β-(1,6)-]galactose trisaccharide and the O-linked glucose-α-(1,4)-galactose disaccharide. N-glycosylation has been considered as assisting Archaea to cope with the challenges of the extreme environments they often occupy. For instance, enhanced surface charge in the face of hypersaline conditions and hence increased solubility was offered as an explanation for the high sulfated sugar content of N-linked glycans decorating the Hbt. salinarum S-layer glycoprotein relative to its Hfx. volcanii counterpart, given the higher salinity of the locale in which the former lives.'
 'Currently defined archaeal N-linked glycans are depicted in Figure 22.3. The structural diversity of N- and O-linked glycans in Archaea. The structures of N-linked glycans found in the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota are shown. The OTase (STT3 or AglB) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cytoplasmic membrane (right), (more...) The first reported archaeal N-glycosylated protein, the Halobacterium salinarum S-layer glycoprotein, was shown to be modified by two different N-linked oligosaccharides, a repeating sulfated pentasaccharide linked via N-glycosylamine to Asn-2 and a sulfated glycan linked by a glucose residue to 10 other Asn residues. The latter glycan is also N-linked to archaellins in this haloarchaeon. Efforts undertaken at the time aimed at deciphering the pathways responsible for the synthesis of these glycans relied solely on biochemical approaches because neither suitable genetic tools nor a genome sequence were available. Despite these biochemical advances, delineation of archaeal N-glycosylation pathways had to wait until the genome age and the development of tools for the genetic manipulation of various species. Through the subsequent identification of homologs of eukaryotic and/or bacterial N-glycosylation pathway components, genome scanning for additional components, the generation of deletion strains, and characterization of reporter glycoproteins, agl (archaeal glycosylation) genes comprising archaeal N-glycosylation pathways have been identified in several Archaea, including halophilic, methanogenic, and thermophilic species. In the last decade, progress in defining pathways of N-glycosylation has relied on Haloferax volcanii as a model organism. In Hfx. volcanii, a series of Agl proteins mediate the assembly and attachment of a pentasaccharide with the structure mannose-1,2-[methyl-O-4-]glucuronic acid-β1-4-galacturonic acid-α1-4-glucuronic acid-β1-4-glucose-β-Asn to the S-layer glycoprotein and archaellins (Figure 22.4). Acting at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, the glycosyltransferases AglJ, AglG, AglI, and AglE sequentially add the first four pentasaccharide residues onto a common Dol-P carrier, whereas AglD adds the final pentasaccharide residue, mannose, to a distinct Dol-P (Figure 22.3). Assembly of the Dol-P-linked tetrasaccharide also involves AglF, a glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, AglM, a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, AglP, a methyltransferase, and AglQ, a predicted isomerase. AglF and AglM have been shown to act in a sequential and coordinated manner in vitro, transforming glucose-1-phosphate into UDP-glucuronic acid. AglB, the archaeal oligosaccharyltransferase, transfers the lipid-linked tetrasaccharide to select Asn residues of target proteins. The final mannose residue is subsequently transferred from its Dol-P carrier to the protein-bound tetrasaccharide in a reaction requiring AglR, a protein that either serves as the Dol-P-mannose flippase or contributes to such activity, and AglS, a Dol-P-mannose mannosyltransferase. Interestingly, N-glycosylation of the S-layer protein is altered in response to a change in environmental conditions.

 'N-glycosylation has been considered as assisting Archaea to cope with the challenges of the extreme environments they often occupy. For instance, enhanced surface charge in the face of hypersaline conditions and hence increased solubility was offered as an explanation for the high sulfated sugar content of N-linked glycans decorating the Hbt. salinarum S-layer glycoprotein relative to its Hfx. volcanii counterpart, given the higher salinity of the locale in which the former lives. In other instances, it is not clear how a given N-glycosylation profile contributes to life in harsh surroundings. In Hfx. volcanii, however, N-glycosylation may provide cells with the ability to respond to changes in the surrounding salinity. As noted above, the N-glycosylation profile of the S-layer glycoprotein differs in cells grown in 3.4 or 1.75 m NaCl-containing medium (Figure 22.3). Modified glycosylation in response to environmental conditions has also been reported in the case of M. hungatei, in which archaellins are only modified in a low phosphate-containing medium. Furthermore, a fully assembled N-glycan has been shown to be required for a broad range of biological functions, including motility and species-specific cell-cell recognition. Archaeal biofilms have been identified in a large variety of habitats (e.g., at low and high temperatures), as well as under acidic, alkaline, and high-salt conditions. It is proposed that Archaea, especially those that require interaction with other species, synthesize biofilms to support these cell–cell interactions. Detailed analyses of the structure and composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) of archaeal biofilms are limited. The sugar composition of a few EPSs has been analyzed by lectin binding assays. Such studies revealed that in Sulfolobales species, for instance, the EPS mainly consists of glucose, galactose, mannose, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.22 Benjamin H. Meyer, Sonja-Verena Albers, Jerry Eichler, and Markus Aebi. This chapter describes the current knowledge of archaeal glycobiology. As in bacteria and eukaryotes, the archaeal cell surface is covered with glycans, which serve as an essential part of the cell wall polysaccharides and as a modification of lipids or surface proteins, as well as the major component of the extracellular matrix. Recent discoveries shed light on a tremendous structural and functional diversity of carbohydrates in this domain of life. In particular, the pathways of N-linked protein glycosylation, homologous to the eukaryotic N-glycosylation machinery, generate a wide variety of N-linked glycans in different archaeal species. Based on Carl Woese's pioneering use of 16S ribosomal (r)RNA analysis, the Archaea were first recognized as a separate domain of life, distinct from either Bacteria or Eukarya. As the first Archaea identified were isolated from some of the most physically challenging environments on the planet, such as those defined by extremes in salinity, pH, or temperature, it was assumed that all Archaea were extremophiles. However, the discovery of Archaea in a variety of “normal” as well as “extreme” biological niches revealed that Archaea represent a major portion of the microbial population and that they play crucial roles in geochemical cycles on Earth. Furthermore, the discoveries of new archaeal lineages in the last decade, predominantly based on metagenomics studies, have led to extensive expansion and reconstruction of the archaeal phylogenetic tree. At present, attempts to cultivate these newly identified Archaea have rarely been successful. Nevertheless, the study of cultivated Archaea has led to many important discoveries. Since Neuberger's discovery of protein glycosylation in the late 1930s (Chapter 1) and his description of the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-β-asparagine linkage of a glycan to the modified protein, it became generally accepted that protein glycosylation was a process limited to eukaryotes. This long-held belief was challenged in 1976, when Mescher and Strominger showed that the surface (S)-layer glycoprotein of the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was subject to both N- and O-glycosylation, thus offering the first example of a noneukaryotic glycoprotein. Today, it is clear that protein glycosylation is an almost universal trait of the Archaea. The discovery that Archaea do not contain murein in their cell wall was one of the main arguments used to distinguish this group of prokaryotes from Bacteria. Indeed, at the time, cell wall composition was considered to be “the only useful phylogenetic criterion, other than direct molecular phylogenetic measurement” to distinguish between the two prokaryotic domains. Some methanogenic Archaea were, however, shown to include a distinct polymer termed pseudomurein (or pseudopeptidoglycan) in their cell wall, whereas other archaeal species were found to assemble cell walls based on different sugar-based polymers. Today, as more and more archaeal species are cultivated, it is becoming clear that Archaea present numerous variations in the composition of the cell surface. For instance, although many species seem to mainly rely on a cell envelope in which the cytoplasmic membrane is enclosed by a two-dimensional crystalline proteinaceous layer called the surface (S)-layer, strains surrounded by two membranes have been identified. Figure 22.1 summarizes current knowledge about archaeal cell surfaces. Diversity of archaeal cell wall structures. The different cell wall components are shown on the right. In the inner circle, the number of loci encoding putative oligosaccharyltransferases in the respective genomes is shown.  Similar to the Bacteria, there is no cell wall structure unique to all Archaea.""
 'Although the building blocks of heteropolysaccharide have been suggested, biosynthesis of this cell wall structure has yet to be described. Individual cells of Methanosarcina rely on an S-layer as their cell wall. A cubic aggregate of four cells (sarcina) is covered by an additional rigid fibrillar polymer called methanochondroitin. Degradation of methanochondroitin results in the disaggregation of the cells, underlining that the matrix is responsible for maintenance of the aggregate. Methanochondroitin, which is similar to eukaryotic connective tissue chondroitin, is composed of a repeating trimer of uronic acid and two GalNAc residues. Yet unlike chondroitin, methanochondroitin is not sulfated. A pathway of methanochondroitin biosynthesis has been proposed based on activated precursors in Methanosarcina barkeri cell extracts. Methanosarcina species can further modify the methanochondroitin condition largely through the addition of glucose and galactose acids. Members of the thermoacidophilic order Thermoplasmatales (pH 1–2 and 60°C), such as Ferroplasma acidophilum and Thermoplasma acidophilum, lack a rigid cell envelope. Such organisms thus display a pleomorphic shape, similar to mycoplasma. Stabilization of the cell is most likely realized by the oligosaccharide portions of lipoglycans and membrane-associated glycoproteins. The outwardly oriented glycan chains form a protective slime coat called the glycocalyx. A recent study of different T. acidophilum cell-surface glycoproteins identified an N-linked branched octosaccharide described below. The majority of characterized Archaea rely on a proteinaceous cell wall, the S-layer, comprising a regularly structured two-dimensional array based on a single protein species, the S-layer glycoprotein, or a limited number of proteins (Figure 22.1). In some archaeal species, the S-layer can be further supported by polysaccharides, by a second S-layer sheet, or by additional surface glycoproteins. For example, the S-layer of Methanospirillum hungatei is further enclosed by a tubular proteinaceous sheath. These sheaths form a paracrystalline structure based on a simple p2 lattice, which is distinct from that of the S-layer. Depending on the species, the proteinaceous sheaths can be glycosylated. Another example is the extremely halophilic Haloquadratum walsbyi. The unique square-shaped cells, with a thickness of only 0.1–0.5 µm, are surrounded by one or two S-layer sheets. An extremely large glycoprotein, termed halomucin, highly similar to mammalian mucin, is loosely connected to the S-layer. Halomucin is heavily glycosylated, containing more than 280 potential N-glycosylation sites (on average one site every 32 residues). This cell envelope is further enforced by analogues of halomucin, termed Hmu2 and Hmu3, and most likely by a poly-γ-glutamate capsule. To date, glycoproteins from Archaea isolated from a wide range of habitats have been studied to various degrees of detail. Possibly reflecting the varied niches occupied by these organisms, their S-layer glycoproteins and other glycoproteins, such as archaellins and pilins, bear N-linked glycans that present wider diversity in terms of size; degree of branching; the identity of the linking sugar; modification of sugar components by amino acids, sulfate, and methyl groups; and the presence of unique sugars than reported to date in Bacteria or Eukarya. Currently defined archaeal N-linked glycans are depicted in Figure 22.3. The structural diversity of N- and O-linked glycans in Archaea. The structures of N-linked glycans found in the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota are shown.']","The biosynthesis of archaeal O-glycans remains relatively understudied compared to N-glycan biosynthesis. Among the limited characterized O-glycans in archaeal species, Haloarcula hispanica has been reported to utilize Dol-P-Glc as a sugar donor for the assembly of the N-linked glucose-α-(1,2)-[sulfoquinovosamine-β-(1,6)-]galactose trisaccharide and the O-linked glucose-α-(1,4)-galactose disaccharide.","N-glycosylation has been considered as assisting Archaea to cope with the challenges of the extreme environments they often occupy. For instance, enhanced surface charge in the face of hypersaline conditions and hence increased solubility was offered as an explanation for the high sulfated sugar content of N-linked glycans decorating the Hbt. salinarum S-layer glycoprotein relative to its Hfx. volcanii counterpart, given the higher salinity of the locale in which the former lives. In other instances, it is not clear how a given N-glycosylation profile contributes to life in harsh surroundings. In Hfx. volcanii, however, N-glycosylation may provide cells with the ability to respond to changes in the surrounding salinity.",1.0,0.7648880850402422,0.6495488210588127,0.008130081300813009,0.99999999998,0.75
"Complete the following paragraph: A. fumigatus is an environmental mold that spreads by airborne particles. It causes serious invasive disease in immunocompromised people that is difficult to treat, leading to high mortality rates.","['In particular, these structures are recognized by the mannose receptor and by dectin-2. These are C-type lectins expressed by immune cells that are important in both innate and adaptive immune responses (see Chapter 34). PLM antigens may be shed by C. albicans and, through interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLR-2), they can induce nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and cytokine responses such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. Galectin-3, a ubiquitous member of the galectin family of lectins that is highly expressed in macrophages, also appears to recognize C. albicans expressing β1-2-linked mannose residues, resulting in opsonization of the yeast. A. fumigatus is an environmental mold that spreads by airborne particles. It causes serious invasive disease in immunocompromised people that is difficult to treat, leading to high mortality rates. As with other fungal pathogens, the surface glycans of A. fumigatus are critical for interactions with the host. The cell wall of infectious forms of this fungus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors. The hyphal wall has a core of branched β1-3-glucan covalently linked to other glucan components, chitin, and galactomannan, which consists of a mannose backbone with short galactofuranose side chains. Interestingly, galactomannan also occurs anchored to the plasma membrane by a GPI. This polysaccharide is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and is probably transferred to the cell wall by transglycosidases, in the same way as GPI-anchored proteins. A. fumigatus also produces an extracellular matrix composed of monosaccharides, α1-3-glucan, galactomannan, and a galactosaminogalactan composed of variable galactopyranose repeats linked to N-acetylgalactosamine, which are partially de-acetylated. This structure has been implicated in adhesion and fungal virulence. The extracellular matrix also plays an important role in concealing the immunogenic β1-3 glucan layer from the immune system. C. neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental basidiomycete yeast that causes severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, leading to roughly half a million deaths per year worldwide. It is unique among pathogenic fungi in having an extensive polysaccharide capsule that is required for virulence (Figure 23.6). The capsule is a dynamic structure that changes in thickness and composition depending on the environment and growth conditions. It is particularly large in the context of mammalian infection, in which it impedes host immune responses. It is composed of two large (millions of Da) polysaccharides named for their monosaccharide components: glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal). GXM is an extended α1-3 mannan substituted with β1-2Xyl, β1-4Xyl, and β1-2GlcA (Figure 23.7); a subset of the mannose residues are 6-O-acetylated (not shown). The second polymer, GXMGal, is based on α1-6 galactan, with side chains of galactose, glucuronic acid, mannose, and xylose (Figure 23.7); the backbone is also modified with small amounts of β1-2-linked galactofuranose (not shown). Association of the capsule with the cell surface relies on a cell-wall component, α1-3 glucan. Although α1-3 glucan is not present in the cell walls of S. cerevisiae or C. albicans, it is common in other fungi. N-glycans of C. neoformans are generally high mannose with modest outer chain extensions and may include xylose β1-2-linked to the trimannosyl core. Both N- and O-glycans may also be modified with xylose and xylose phosphate. A quick-freeze deep-etch image of the edge of a Cryptococcus neoformans cell.'

Structures of capsular polysaccharides in Cryptococcus neoformans.  In the context of fungal diseases, the similarity of fungi to their eukaryote hosts becomes a liability, because it is challenging to develop antifungal drugs that are not hampered by toxicity. The unique features of fungal glycans may suggest drug targets to help improve this picture, and decrease the roughly one million deaths each year caused by fungal infections. The major success story using this approach is the development of echinocandin drugs. These antifungal lipopeptides inhibit β1-3-glucan synthesis in fungi including Candida and Aspergillus, leading to cell wall compromise, and are used clinically to treat invasive fungal infections, although they are not effective against all fungal pathogens. GPI-synthesis inhibitors also offer promise for treatment of fungal pathogens; compounds that selectively inhibit yeast inositol acylation are currently in clinical trials. Continued efforts to target novel aspects of fungal glycobiology may advance the ongoing search for new therapies. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Anne Imberty and Markus Pauly.'
 'Finally, the xylans of this organism are linear β1-4-linked polymers of xylose, more typical of those found in “higher” plants and algae than in fungi. D. glabratum also synthesizes several unusual short glycolipids, including glycosyldiacylglycerolipids, which are similar to plant glycolipids and contain monosaccharides, disaccharides, and linear trisaccharides of α1-6-linked galactopyranose. This fungus thus highlights the extensive glycan diversity of the fungal kingdom. Another example of glycan diversity is offered by Cryptococcus laurentii, which has the unusual property of producing toxins that kill a pathogenic yeast, C. albicans (see below). The O-glycans of C. laurentii are unusual in that they contain mannose, xylose, and galactose (Figure 23.3C); these glycans are synthesized by a unique set of mannosyl-, xylosyl-, and galactosyltransferases that are not homologous to human enzymes. This diversity would not have been predicted by studies of model yeast alone, emphasizing the importance of examining glycans in a wide range of fungal species. Coprinopsis cinerea is a mushroom species that has gained prominence as a model for studies of diverse topics including mating, sexual development, meiosis, and the evolution of multicellularity. Its N-glycans typically are high mannose type with five to nine mannoses, but may also have a bisecting α1-4GlcNAc at the β-mannose. Pathogenic fungi are a significant cause of plant and animal disease, responsible for devastation of crops, decimation of animal populations (e.g., certain bat, amphibian, and bee species), and serious human diseases that kill an estimated one million people each year. These organisms display diverse glycans, which typically differ from those of the host and have been implicated in multiple pathogenic processes and host–pathogen interactions. For example, during plant infections plant glycosylhydrolases may partially digest wall glucans of invading fungi. Some of the released oligosaccharides, termed oligosaccharins, can then act as signals to promote plant antifungal defenses. C. albicans (an ascomycete) is a normal commensal organism that can cause illness ranging from irritations of mucosal surfaces to life-threatening systemic infections. The C. albicans cell wall contains β1-3- and β1-6-linked glucans and chitin, similar to the S. cerevisiae wall, and immunogenic mannans that are termed phosphopeptidomannans. It also produces unusual short β1-2-linked mannose chains (Figure 23.2) that are highly antigenic and are also expressed on phospholipomannan (PLM) antigens. PLM antigens contain phytoceramide derivatives of myo-inositol phosphate. The β1-2 mannosides are linked via an α-mannosylphosphate to the common glycosphingolipid Manα-1,2 inositolphosphoceramide. The abundant GPI-anchored proteins of C. albicans have been implicated in fungal adherence to host tissues. The O-glycans of C. albicans are short chains of α1-2-linked mannose (Figure 23.3A), which lack the α1-3-linked mannose caps found in S. cerevisiae. As in S. cerevisiae, deficiencies of O-mannose addition generated through genetic deletions are lethal, indicating that O-mannosylation is essential in this yeast. C. albicans mannans are also important in its interactions with host cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. In particular, these structures are recognized by the mannose receptor and by dectin-2. These are C-type lectins expressed by immune cells that are important in both innate and adaptive immune responses (see Chapter 34). PLM antigens may be shed by C. albicans and, through interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLR-2), they can induce nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and cytokine responses such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion.'
 'The promoter for AOX is methanol inducible, and transcripts driven by this promoter may comprise up to 5% of the total poly(A)+ RNA in induced cells. P. pastoris has several advantages over Escherichia coli as an expression system, because it does not produce inclusion bodies and it promotes the correct folding of eukaryotic proteins. It also has certain advantages over typical model yeast. First, although its basic N-glycosylation pathway is similar to that of S. cerevisiae and yields glycoproteins with oligomannose-type N-glycans, these structures in P. pastoris have only five to 15 mannose residues (typically Man9GlcNAc2Asn and Man8GlcNAc2Asn) compared with the 50 to 150 mannose residues found in glycoproteins from S. cerevisiae (see Figure 23.2). Hyperglycosylation in S. cerevisiae can interfere with protein folding, requiring use of mnn mutants to limit hyperglycosylation and avoid this problem. Also, P. pastoris does not add outer α1-3-linked mannose residues to its N-glycans. These structures are highly antigenic to humans, making proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae unsuitable for human pharmaceutical use. P. pastoris synthesizes O-glycans with an O-linked mannose core attached to Ser/Thr residues; most of these are short α1-2-linked mannose structures (see Figure 23.3A). Genetic tools have been used to manipulate the machinery for glycoprotein assembly of both S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris. Deletion of ER- and Golgi-specific functionalities in combination with the introduction of heterologous hydrolases and glycosyltransferases has generated “humanized” yeasts and filamentous fungi for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 56). P. pastoris has emerged as a potent orthogonal host to produce exogenous polysaccharides such as those occurring in the plant cell wall. Kluyveromyces lactis metabolizes lactose to lactic acid and, along with Aspergillus niger and E. coli, is grown to produce rennet for making cheese and other products. K. lactis is also a rich source of β-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes lactose. K. lactis synthesizes mannans similar to those in S. cerevisiae, but they lack mannose phosphate modifications and some side chains are capped with a residue of N-acetylglucosamine. A K. lactis mutant that lacks these N-acetylglucosamine residues because of a deficiency of the Golgi UDP-GlcNAc nucleotide sugar transporter has been productively exploited in studies of heterologous transporters. To convey the enormous diversity of fungi we will consider the basidiomycete phylum, which encompasses fungi that produce spores from a pedestal-like structure called the basidium. Basidiomycetes range from fungi with gills or pores, such as common mushrooms and bracket fungi, to budding yeast that are deadly human pathogens. The basidiomycete Dictyonema glabratum illustrates a distinct fungal lifestyle. It lives in symbiosis with cyanobacteria Scytonema sp. forming a lichen, which is notable for its many unusual glycans. For example, although the β-glucans of most lichens are linear, in D. glabratum they are branched with β1-3 and β1-6 linkages. The mannans of D. glabratum also have an α1-3-linked backbone, rather than the typical α1-6 linkages found in other lichens, along with branches at the 2 and 4 positions. Finally, the xylans of this organism are linear β1-4-linked polymers of xylose, more typical of those found in “higher” plants and algae than in fungi. D. glabratum also synthesizes several unusual short glycolipids, including glycosyldiacylglycerolipids, which are similar to plant glycolipids and contain monosaccharides, disaccharides, and linear trisaccharides of α1-6-linked galactopyranose.'
 ""Life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, a parasitic protozoan that causes the most severe form of malaria in humans. The bite of the female Anopheles mosquito introduces sporozoites into the human host, which mature as they travel to the liver and ultimately (more...) Following inoculation into the bloodstream, the sporozoite's major circumsporozoite protein (CSP) interacts with heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of hepatocytes, which allows invasion and the first replication in the mammalian host. Liver HS possesses an unusually high degree of sulfation compared to similar glycosaminoglycans from other organs, suggesting the basis for the selective targeting of Plasmodium to hepatocytes. A recombinant form of the pre-erythrocytic CSP made in yeast is a components of the RTS,S vaccine currently being implemented worldwide. Interestingly, the T-cell epitope of CSP is O-fucosylated, but the recombinant yeast-derived protein is not O-fucosylated. On exit from the liver, Plasmodium merozoites use multiple ligand–receptor interactions to invade host erythrocytes. The merozoite proteins, such as the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) proteins (Table 43.4), vary in their dependency on sialic acid residues on the erythrocyte surface and play an important role in erythrocyte invasion. Some major parasites and their glycan-binding proteins  The glycophorins are the major sialic acid–containing glycoproteins on erythrocytes. The EBL protein EBA-175 (erythrocyte-binding antigen-175) recognizes clusters of sialylated O-glycans attached to glycophorin A, particularly within a 30-amino-acid region that carries 11 O-glycans. Desialylation of erythrocytes precludes interactions of some strains of P. falciparum, and individuals lacking glycophorins A or B are refractory to invasion. Some strains of P. falciparum can reversibly switch from sialic acid–dependent to sialic acid–independent invasion, and this has important implications for vaccine design against malaria parasites. Pregnancy-associated malaria is a major cause of suffering and arises when P. falciparum–infected erythrocytes are sequestered in the placenta of pregnant women. The parasite expresses the VAR2CSA protein, which mediates adherence of the infected erythrocytes to placental chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) with very high specificity and affinity (Kd∼15 nm), promoting parasite infection and invasion. Eruption of the merozoites from infected erythrocytes releases free glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), which are prominent virulence factors contributing to malaria pathogenesis (Chapter 12). P. falciparum GPIs mimic host GPIs and activate host GPI-associated signaling pathways. The GPIs can activate host's macrophages, mainly through Toll-like receptor-2 signaling, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of cell-adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin in endothelial cells. Antibodies to these GPIs can neutralize their effects and mitigate the pathology of the disease independently of direct infection. In addition, the P. falciparum genome encodes a number of enzymes involved in N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation (O-fucosylation) and C-mannosylation. Whereas N-glycans are truncated and typically contain only a chitobiosyl core, GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ-Asn, mannose is abundantly present in GPI anchors. There is also evidence suggesting that Plasmodia may express a number of unusual glycoconjugates, such as galactose- and glucose-containing glycoproteins and glucose-containing glycolipids. African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) transmitted by blood-sucking tsetse flies are the etiologic agents of nagana disease in cattle and sleeping sickness in humans. A remarkable feature of these organisms is their ability to survive extracellularly in the host bloodstream, where they are constantly exposed to the immune system.""]","The cell wall of infectious forms of A. fumigatus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors.

"Complete the following paragraph: Apiogalacturonans have only been identified in the walls of duckweeds and seagrasses. The substituted galacturonan referred to as RG-II, which accounts for between 2% and 5% of the primary cell wall, is the most structurally complex polysaccharide yet identified in nature.","['In grasses, mixed linkage glucan is present mainly in young tissues, which has led to the suggestion that it is a carbohydrate storage molecule as also indicated by its metabolism during plant development. Callose, a polysaccharide composed of 1-3-linked β glucosyl residues, is another β-glucan produced by plants (Figure 24.1G). It is used to form a temporary cell wall at the cell plate during cytokinesis and is involved in regulating the permeability of plasmodesmata. It is often formed in response to abiotic and biotic stresses or damage. Pectins are structurally complex polysaccharides that contain 1-4-linked α-D-GalpA. Three structurally distinct pectins—homogalacturonan, substituted galacturonan, and rhamnogalacturonan—have been identified in plant cell walls (Figure 24.2). Homogalacturonan, which may account for up to 65% of the pectin in a primary wall, is composed of 1-4-linked α-D-GalpA. The carboxyl group may be methyl-esterified, thus neutralizing the negative charge of this glycosyl moiety, and the uronic acid itself may be acetylated at O-2 or O-3. The extent of methyl-esterification is controlled by pectin methylesterases and pectin methylesterase inhibitors present in the wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the ability of homogalacturonan-containing glycans to form ionic calcium cross-links with themselves and with other pectic polymers. Such interactions alter the mechanical properties of the wall and may influence plant growth and development. Rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) is a family of polysaccharides with a backbone composed of a repeating disaccharide 4-α-D-GalpA-1-2-α-L-Rhap-1. Many of the GalpAs are acetylated at O-2 and/or O-3. Depending on the plant, between 20% and 80% of the Rhap residues may be substituted at O-4 with linear or branched side chains composed predominantly of Araf and Galp, together with smaller amounts of Fucp and GlcpA (Figure 24.2). Little is known about the functions of these side chains and their contribution to the properties of the primary wall. Substituted galacturonans have a backbone composed of 1-4-linked α-D-GalpA acid residues that are substituted to varying degrees with mono-, di-, or oligosaccharides. For example, xylogalacturonans contain single β-D-Xylp residues linked to O-3 of some of the backbone residues (Figure 24.2), whereas apiogalacturonans have β-D-apiose (Apif) and apiobiose linked to O-2 of some of the backbone residues. Apiogalacturonans have only been identified in the walls of duckweeds and seagrasses. The substituted galacturonan referred to as RG-II, which accounts for between 2% and 5% of the primary cell wall, is the most structurally complex polysaccharide yet identified in nature. It is composed of 12 different monosaccharides linked together by up to 21 distinct glycosidic linkages (Figure 24.2). Four structurally different side chains and one or two Araf substituents are attached to the galacturonan backbone. Two structurally conserved disaccharides (side chains C and D) are linked to O-3 of the backbone. The A and B side chains, which contain between 7 and 9 monosaccharides, are linked to O-2 of the backbone. Several of the monosaccharides in RG-II are O-methylated and/or O-acetylated. Virtually all of the RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer cross-linked by a borate ester. The ester is formed between the Apif residue in side chain A of each RG-II monomer (Figure 24.2).'
 'The A and B side chains, which contain between 7 and 9 monosaccharides, are linked to O-2 of the backbone. Several of the monosaccharides in RG-II are O-methylated and/or O-acetylated. Virtually all of the RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer cross-linked by a borate ester. The ester is formed between the Apif residue in side chain A of each RG-II monomer (Figure 24.2). The dimer forms rapidly in vitro when the RG-II monomer is reacted with boric acid and a divalent cation. However, the mechanism and site of dimer formation in planta has not been determined. Borate cross-linking of RG-II is likely to have substantial effects on the properties of pectin and the primary wall as RG-II is itself linked to homogalacturonan (Figure 24.2). Indeed, mutations that affect RG-II structure and cross-linking result in plants with abnormal walls and severe growth defects. Swollen primary walls and abnormal growth together with reduced RG-II cross-linking are also a characteristic of boron deficient plants. RG-II was believed to be largely resistant to fragmentation by microbial enzymes. However, recent studies have shown that bacteria present in the human gut produce glycanases capable of hydrolyzing all but one of the glycosidic bonds in RG-II. Pectin is believed to exist in the cell wall as a macromolecular complex comprised of structural domains—homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan, and substituted galacturonan—that are covalently and noncovalently linked to one another. However, there is only a limited understanding of how these structural domains are organized (Figure 24.2). Molecular modeling of a pectin (∼50 kDa) containing homogalacturonan (degree of polymerization ∼100) and rhamnogalacturonan with arabinogalactan side chains, together with modeling of RG-II conformation have begun to provide insights into the conformations and relative dimensions of each pectin structural domain. The homogalacturonan region has a persistence length of approximately 20 GalAp residues, which is likely to be sufficient to stabilize junction zones formed with Ca++. In vitro studies suggest that the maximum stability of such junction zones is obtained with oligomers containing approximately 15 nonesterified GalpA residues. Thus, controlling the distribution of methyl-ester groups along the homogalacturonan backbone provides a mechanism to regulate the physical properties of pectin, including its ability to form gels. For a gel to form and not to be brittle, other features including sequences that interrupt interchain associations in the pectin macromolecule may be important. For example, the structural diversity and the conformational flexibility of the oligosaccharide side chains of the rhamnogalacturonan domain will limit or prevent interchain pairing. The presence of 1-2-linked Rhap residues does not introduce kinks into the backbone geometry of rhamnogalacturonan and thereby limit interchain associations. Rather, it is the side chains linked to these residues that are responsible for preventing or limiting interchain associations. The conformations of the four side chains attached to the homogalacturonan backbone may lead RG-II to adopt a “disk-like” shape. Well-defined tertiary structures are predicted for the RG-II monomer and the dimer. In the dimer, borate-ester cross-linking and Ca++ interchain pairing further stabilizes the two disks. The apparent resistance of RG-II to wall-modifying enzymes together with the formation of a cation-stabilized RG-II dimer likely results in a structure that resists temporal changes in the plant. In contrast, homogalacturonan is continually modified by the action of wall enzymes and its contribution to wall architecture is therefore time dependent. Increased knowledge of the physical properties of primary wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans is required to understand how modulating the amounts and structural features of a few common polysaccharides and glycan domains lead to primary walls with diverse properties and functionalities.'
 'Cellulases and other enzymes involved in cellulose hydrolysis often exist as macromolecular complexes referred to as cellulosomes. Improving the effectiveness of cellulosomes is an area of active research, to increase the conversion of plant biomass to fermentable sugar (Chapter 59). Hemicelluloses are branched polysaccharides with a backbone composed of 1-4-linked β-D-pyranosyl residues with an equatorial O-4 (Glcp, Manp, and Xylp). Xyloglucan, glucurono/arabinoxylan, and glucomannan (Figure 24.1B–E) are included under this chemical definition of hemicelluloses. Hemicelluloses and cellulose have structural and conformational similarities that allow them to form strong, noncovalent associations with one another in the cell wall, although the biological significance of these interactions is still a subject of debate. Xyloglucan and cellulose both have a backbone of 1-4-linked β-D-Glcp residues, but unlike cellulose, xyloglucan contains sidechain substituents. The xyloglucan backbone is highly substituted with α-Xylp substituents at O-6 and in some cases with O-acetyl-substituents (Figure 24.1B). Each Xylp residue may itself be extended by the addition of one or more monosaccharides including β-D-Galp, α-L-Fucp, α-L-Araf, α-L-Arap, β-D-Xylp, β-D-GalpA, and O-acetyl substituents. Twenty-three structurally unique side chains have been identified to date, although only a subset of these are synthesized by a single plant species. Early models of dicot primary walls predicted that xyloglucans acted as tethers between cellulose microfibrils and that controlled enzymatic cleavage or reorganization of xyloglucan by proteins facilitated wall expansion and thus plant cell growth. However, this notion has been challenged by genetic engineering of xyloglucan structures in Arabidopsis plants, which revealed that eliminating xyloglucan entirely from the primary wall has remarkably little effect on overall plant growth and development. In contrast, removing only selected sidechain substituents of xyloglucan is detrimental to plant growth and replacing the sidechains with various glycosyl moieties restores plant growth, independent of the glycosyl moiety added. These results have led to the suggestion that xyloglucan acts as a spacer molecule to keep cellulose microfibrils apart and that pectin has a more important role in controlling wall expansion than previously believed. Arabinoxylan (Figure 24.1D) is the predominant noncellulosic polysaccharide in the type II walls of the grasses, with only small amounts present in dicot primary walls. Its backbone is composed of 1-4-linked β-D-Xylp residues, many of which are substituted at O-3 with α-L-Araf residues. These Araf residues may be further substituted at O-2 with an α-L-Araf or a β-D-Xylp residue. A small number of the backbone residues are substituted at O-2 with α-D-GlcpA and its 4-O-methylated counterpart (MeGlcpA). The presence of 1-3, 1-4-linked β-glucans (also referred to as mixed-linkage glucans) (Figure 24.1F) in the walls of grasses was once considered to be a unique feature of these plants. However, structurally related mixed-linkage β-glucans have also been identified in the walls of Selaginella (lycopod) and Equisetum (horsetails), although the evolutionary relationship between these β-glucans is not known. In grasses, mixed linkage glucan is present mainly in young tissues, which has led to the suggestion that it is a carbohydrate storage molecule as also indicated by its metabolism during plant development. Callose, a polysaccharide composed of 1-3-linked β glucosyl residues, is another β-glucan produced by plants (Figure 24.1G).'
 'However, understanding their diverse polysaccharide structures could have important implications for the evolution of the more complex structures present in land plants. The Viridiplantae are believed to have diverged into the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, between 800 and 1200 million years ago. The Chlorophyta, which include diverse marine, freshwater, and terrestrial green algae, often have cell walls that are quite distinct from the walls of the Streptophytes. For example, the extracellular matrix of the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a crystalline lattice formed from HRGPs, whereas this matrix is rich in Kdo and Dha in the prasinophytes. The Streptophyta comprise land plants and the charophyte algae including the late diverging Zygnematophyceae, which are currently believed to include the closest living relatives of land plants. Indeed, the cell wall of Penium margaritaceum, a unicellular Zygnematophyte, contains cellulose, pectic, and hemicellulose-like glycans. With the emergence of whole-genome sequencing and extensive transcriptomic analyses, detailed phylogenetic trees of glycan synthesis-related GTs are being established including GTs from green algae and land plants. Such data are required to develop hypotheses predicting when and how different structural forms of diverse cell wall polysaccharides evolved across the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. Detailed structural and architectural analyses of algal and land plant cell wall glycans and the substrate and acceptor specificities of the corresponding GTs will be required to resolve many of the evolutionary transitions within the Viridiplantae. Numerous specialized algal polysaccharides are used by humans. For example, several of the polysaccharides produced by red and brown algae are used in the food industry as gelling agents, stabilizers, thickeners, and emulsifiers. They are also used in paints, in cosmetics, in paper, and as reagents for scientific research. These polysaccharides include agarose (agar) and carrageenan, which are sulfated galactans obtained from red seaweeds. These polysaccharides are composed of the repeating disaccharide 3-β-D-Galp-1-4-3,6-anhydro-α-L-Galp-1 unit. Some of the d-Galp and l-Galp units are O-methylated. Pyruvate and sulfate groups may also be present in small quantities. Alginate, a linear polysaccharide composed of 1-4-linked β-D-ManpA and its C-5 epimer 1-4-linked α-L-GulpA, produced by various species of brown seaweed is another example of a commercially important polysaccharide. These monosaccharides are typically arranged in blocks of either ManpA or GulpA separated by regions comprised of 4-ManpA-1-4-GulpA-1 sequences. Brown seaweeds produce polysaccharides that have potential in the treatment of diseases. Laminaran is a linear storage polysaccharide composed of 1-3- and 1-6-linked β-D-Glcp residues. There are reports that laminaran has antiapoptotic and antitumor activities. Fucoidans are a group of sulfated polysaccharides isolated from several brown algae that have been reported to have anticoagulant, antitumor, antithrombosis, antiinflammatory, and antiviral properties. Fucoidans have a backbone of 1-3-linked α-Fucp that is substituted at O-2 with fucose and at O-4 with sulfate or fucose. Other fucoidans have backbones of alternating 1-3- and 1-4-linked α-Fucp residues. Glycoglycerol lipids are the most abundant glycolipids in plants. Mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol have been identified in all plants, whereas tri- and tetragalactosyldiacylglycerol have a more restricted taxonomic distribution (Figure 24.6).'
 'In contrast, homogalacturonan is continually modified by the action of wall enzymes and its contribution to wall architecture is therefore time dependent. Increased knowledge of the physical properties of primary wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans is required to understand how modulating the amounts and structural features of a few common polysaccharides and glycan domains lead to primary walls with diverse properties and functionalities. Further research is also needed to determine if wall structure and function results from the noncovalent interactions of polysaccharides and proteoglycans or from the formation of glycan-containing architectural units with specific structural and functional roles. The latter scenario is analogous to the organization of proteoglycans and O-linked mucins in the extracellular matrix of animal cells (Chapters 10, 16, and 17). The secondary walls of woody tissue and grasses are composed predominantly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and the polyphenol lignin. The inclusion of lignin results in a hydrophobic composite that is a major contributor to the structural characteristics of secondary walls. Heteroxylans are the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide present in the secondary (lignified) cell walls of seed-producing plants. These heteroxylans are classified according to the type and abundance of the substituents on the 1-4-linked β-D-Xylp residues of the polysaccharide backbone. Glucuronoxylans, which are major components in the secondary walls of woody and herbaceous eudicots, have an α-D-GlcpA or MeGlcpA substituent at O-2 (Figure 24.1C). Gymnosperm secondary walls contain arabinoglucuronoxylans (AGXs), which in addition to MeGlcpA substituents, have Araf residues attached to O-3 of some of the backbone residues. The glucuronoarabinoxylans in the secondary walls of grasses typically contain fewer Araf residues than their primary wall counterpart (Figure 24.1D). Ferulic or coumaric acids are often esterified to the Araf residues of xylan in grass primary and secondary cells walls. There is some evidence that the lignin polymer is covalently linked to the secondary wall hemicelluloses. Eudicot and gymnosperm secondary wall xylans have a well-defined glycosyl sequence 1-4-β-D-Xylp-1-3-α-L-Rhap-1-2-α-D-GalpA-1-4-D-Xylp at their reducing end (Figure 24.1C). This sequence is required for normal xylan synthesis during secondary cell-wall formation and may have a role in regulating the polymers chain length. This sequence is present at the reducing end of heteroxylans of all monocots except the grasses. Genes that encode polysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes, including many of those required for xyloglucan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose synthesis and some of those required for pectin synthesis, have been identified. This information, together with improved methods to demonstrate enzymatic activity of recombinant plant GTs in vitro and wall structural analyses of the corresponding plant mutants is providing a framework for an increased understanding of how plant cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized. Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles. This is in contrast to cellulose, which is synthesized at the plasma membrane where the glucan chains are extruded into the apoplast to form cellulose microfibrils. Lignin is polymerized in the apoplast by nonenzymatic radical reactions. Despite advances in identifying and understanding the GTs involved in polysaccharide synthesis, we still do not know how many of the wall polymers are synthesized by Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes or if they are assembled by GTs localized in different regions of the Golgi apparatus. We also do not understand how the newly synthesized polymers are assembled into a functional cell wall in the apoplast. Plants produce glycoproteins and proteoglycans that contain oligo- or polysaccharides that are linked to hydroxyproline (Hyp) and serine (Ser).']","The A and B side chains, which contain between 7 and 9 monosaccharides, are linked to O-2 of the backbone. Several of the monosaccharides in RG-II are O-methylated and/or O-acetylated. Virtually all of the RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer cross-linked by a borate ester. The ester is formed between the Apif residue in side chain A of each RG-II monomer. The dimer forms rapidly in vitro when the RG-II monomer is reacted with boric acid and a divalent cation. However, the mechanism and site of dimer formation in planta has not been determined. Borate cross-linking of RG-II is likely to have substantial effects on the properties of pectin and the primary wall as RG-II is itself linked to homogalacturonan. Indeed, mutations that affect RG-II structure and cross-linking result in plants with abnormal walls and severe growth defects. Swollen primary walls and abnormal growth together with reduced RG-II cross-linking are also a characteristic of boron deficient plants. RG-II was believed to be largely resistant to fragmentation by microbial enzymes. However, recent studies have shown that bacteria present in the human gut produce glycanases capable of hydrolyzing all but one of the glycosidic bonds in RG-II. Pectin is believed to exist in the cell wall as a macromolecular complex comprised of structural domains—homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan, and substituted galacturonan—that are covalently and noncovalently linked to one another. However, there is only a limited understanding of how these structural domains are organized.","It is composed of 12 different monosaccharides linked together by up to 21 distinct glycosidic linkages (Figure 24.2). Four structurally different side chains and one or two Araf substituents are attached to the galacturonan backbone. Two structurally conserved disaccharides (side chains C and D) are linked to O-3 of the backbone. The A and B side chains, which contain between 7 and 9 monosaccharides, are linked to O-2 of the backbone. Several of the monosaccharides in RG-II are O-methylated and/or O-acetylated. Virtually all of the RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer cross-linked by a borate ester. The ester is formed between the Apif residue in side chain A of each RG-II monomer (Figure 24.2).

"Complete the following paragraph: In terms of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), chondroitin and heparan sulfate (CS and HS) have been detected in C. elegans, but neither keratan sulfate (KS), dermatan sulfate (DS), nor hyaluronan (Chapter 16); whereas the CS chains contain a low amount of sulfate, the overall structure of HS in C. elegans is similar to the chains elaborated by vertebrates (see Figure 25.5).","['The requirement for chondroitin assembly in seemingly disparate systems may result from biophysical changes in the lumen of the vulva or between the eggshell and the embryo. One idea is that the high negative charge imparted by the glucuronic acids in chondroitin attracts counterions that raise the local osmolarity, causing a swelling pressure. Another possibility is that the chondroitin acts as a physical scaffold bound to the cell membrane or eggshell. Interestingly, the sqv screen did not detect mutations affecting genes that encode proteoglycan core proteins on which the chondroitin chains assemble, but proteomic analysis has led to the identification of nine novel chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CPG) core proteins modified with chondroitin chains (Figure 25.6). Two of these (CPG-1 and CPG-2) contain chitin-binding domains that presumably allow the proteoglycans to interact with chitin in the eggshell, thus positioning the proteoglycans between the eggshell and the plasma membrane of the embryo, in which they could serve as spacers or osmotic regulators. Silencing cpg-1 and cpg-2 expression by RNAi recapitulates the cytokinesis defect observed in sqv mutants, suggesting that these are the relevant proteoglycans. The proteoglycans involved in epithelial invagination have not yet been determined. Chondroitin proteoglycans (CPGs) of Caenorhabditis elegans.  HS biosynthesis in C. elegans follows the same pattern observed in vertebrate systems (Chapter 17). Mutations in the pathway for HS biosynthesis are lethal in C. elegans. Two of the key genes involved in this pathway are rib-1 and rib-2, homologs of the vertebrate genes Ext2 and Ext1, respectively, which catalyze the polymerization of the backbone of HS chains (GlcAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-4) (Chapter 17). Mutants in rib-2, the worm homolog of Ext1, have defects in development and egg laying. The worm genome also contains a single gene for glucuronic acid C-5 epimerase (hse-5) and five genes for sulfotransferase activities (GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase [Ndst], hst-1; uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase, hst-2; 3-O-sulfotransferases, hst-3.1 and hst-3.2; and 6-O-sulfotransferase, hst-6), all of which are homologs of vertebrate genes involved in HS synthesis. In contrast, vertebrates contain four Ndsts, three 6-O-sulfotransferases, and seven 3-O-sulfotransferases. Although mutations in the epimerase (hse-5) and the sulfotransferases (hst-6, hst-2) do not affect viability, they cause defects in specific cell migration, axonal outgrowth, and/or neurite branching. Consistent with this finding, inactivation of the cell surface HS proteoglycan syndecan (sdn-1) affects neural migration and axonal guidance. C. elegans also produces two GPI-anchored HS proteoglycans. LON-2, a member of the glypican family, negatively regulates a bone morphogenetic protein-like signaling pathway that controls body length in C. elegans. Worms also contain a homolog of the vertebrate basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan (encoded by unc-52). At least three major classes of UNC-52 isoforms are produced through alternative splicing, and distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns occur throughout development. In keeping with the “uncoordinated” phenotype, unc-52 mutants affect myofilament assembly in body-wall muscle during embryonic development. Thus, as in vertebrates, HS proteoglycans mediate many fundamental processes during development and in the adult animal. The arthro-series glycolipids in C. elegans include structures modified with either phosphorylcholine or fucose residues (Figure 25.7A).'
 'KS I, originally detected in cornea, is found on an N-glycan linked to protein through an asparagine residue (Chapter 9). KS II (skeletal keratan sulfate) is found on an O-glycan core 2 structure and is thus linked through N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine (Chapter 10). The structural features in control of keratan sulfate substitution remain unclear, as the underlying poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone can be found on many other glycoproteins. Notably, in humans and bovine, the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan found in cartilage (aggrecan) contains a segment of four to 23 hexapeptide repeats (E-E/L-P-F-P-S) where the keratan sulfate chains are located, whereas aggrecan in rats and other rodents lacks this motif and does not contain keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfates (KS) contain a sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain, linked to either asparagine or serine/threonine residues. Chst1 and 5 can add sulfate groups at the indicated positions. The actual order of the various sulfated and nonsulfated (more...) Two classes of glycosaminoglycan chains—chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate/heparin—are linked to serine residues in proteins by way of xylose (Figure 17.4). Xylosyltransferase initiates the process using UDP-xylose as donor. Two isoforms of the enzyme are known in vertebrates (XYLT1 and XYLT2), but only one isozyme exists in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. A glycine residue invariably lies to the carboxy-terminal side of the serine attachment site, but a perfect consensus sequence for xylosylation does not exist. At least two acidic amino acid residues are usually present, and they can be located on one or both sides of the serine, usually within a few residues. Several proteoglycans contain clustered glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, raising the possibility that xylosyltransferase could act in a processive manner. Xylosylation is an incomplete process in some proteoglycans, which may explain why proteoglycans with multiple potential attachment sites contain different numbers of chains in different cells. The biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (left chain) and heparan sulfate (right chain) is initiated by the formation of a linkage region tetrasaccharide (green circles in Fig. 17.1). Addition of the first hexosamine commits the intermediate to either (more...) After xylose addition, a linkage tetrasaccharide assembles by the transfer of two galactose residues catalyzed by unique members of the β4 galactosyl-, β3 galactosyl-, and β3 glucuronosyltransferase families of enzymes (Figure 17.4). This intermediate can undergo phosphorylation at the C-2 position of xylose and in the case of chondroitin sulfate, sulfation of the galactose residues. In general, phosphorylation and sulfation occur substoichiometrically, but phosphorylation may be transient. Phosphorylation occurs early in the assembly process and creates the preferred substrate for B4GALT7; a phosphatase removes the phosphate at a later stage of biosynthesis. The function of galactose sulfation in chondroitin sulfate remains unclear. The linkage tetrasaccharide lies at a bifurcation in the biosynthetic pathway: addition of β4-linked N-acetylgalactosamine, which initiates chondroitin sulfate assembly, or addition of α4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, which initiates heparan sulfate assembly (Figure 17.4). Genetic evidence from studies of C. elegans suggests that N-acetylgalactosamine addition during chondroitin assembly is mediated by the same enzyme that is involved in chain polymerization (Sqv5), but biochemical evidence suggests that more than one enzyme may exist in vertebrates.'
 'Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF), a protein that lacks independent activity but collaborates with the polymerases to enhance the formation of polymers. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 17.5). Biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate involves the polymerization of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid units and a series of modification reactions including O-sulfation and epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid. Heparan (more...) Additional enzymes exist for epimerization of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid in dermatan sulfate (DSE1-2), sulfation at the C-2 position of the uronic acids, and other patterns of sulfation found in unusual species of chondroitin (Table 17.2). The location of sulfate groups is easily assessed using bacterial chondroitinases (ABC, B, and ACII) that cleave the chains into disaccharides. Many chains are hybrid structures containing more than one type of chondroitin disaccharide unit. For example, dermatan sulfate is defined as having one or more iduronic acid–containing disaccharide units (chondroitin sulfate B) as well as glucuronic acid–containing disaccharides (chondroitin sulfate A and C). Animal cells also degrade chondroitin sulfate in lysosomes using a series of exolytic activities (Chapter 44). Types of chondroitin sulfates  Heparan sulfate assembles as a copolymer of GlcNAcα4GlcAβ4 (Figure 17.5), which then undergoes extensive modification reactions, catalyzed by at least four families of sulfotransferases and one epimerase. N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (NDST1-4) act on a subset of N-acetylglucosamine residues to generate N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNSO3) units, many of which occur in clusters along the chain. Generally, the enzyme deacetylates N-acetylglucosamine and rapidly adds sulfate to the free amino group to form GlcNSO3, but a small number of glucosamine residues with unsubstituted amino groups may arise from incomplete N-sulfation. An epimerase (GLCE), different from the one involved in dermatan sulfate synthesis, then acts on some glucuronic acid residues, followed by 2-O-sulfation of some of the iduronic acid units (catalyzed by HS2ST). Some glucuronic acid units also undergo 2-O-sulfation by the same enzyme. The addition of 2-O-sulfate groups to glucuronic or iduronic acid prevents the reversible epimerization reaction. Next, 6-O-sulfotransferases (HS6ST1-3) add sulfate groups to selected glucosamine residues. Finally, certain subsequences of sulfated sugar residues and uronic acid epimers provide targets for 3-O-sulfotransferases (HS3ST1-6). Unlike other glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate is further modified once displayed at the plasma membrane. A family of plasma membrane endosulfatases (SULFs) can remove sulfate groups from internal 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate and a heparanase can cleave the chains at limited sites. This post-assembly processing of the chains at the cell surface results in altered response of cells to growth factors and morphogens. Intriguingly, the mammalian genome contains other sulfatases of unknown function, raising the possibility that other post-assembly processing reactions of glycosaminoglycans may occur.'
 'Genetic evidence from studies of C. elegans suggests that N-acetylgalactosamine addition during chondroitin assembly is mediated by the same enzyme that is involved in chain polymerization (Sqv5), but biochemical evidence suggests that more than one enzyme may exist in vertebrates. In heparin/heparan sulfate formation, the addition of the first N-acetylglucosamine residue is catalyzed by an enzyme called EXTL3, which differs from the transferases involved in heparan polymerization (called EXT1 and EXT2). These enzymes are important control points because they ultimately regulate the type of glycosaminoglycan chain that will assemble. Control of the addition of β4GalNAc or α4GlcNAc appears to be manifested at the level of enzyme recognition of the polypeptide substrate. Keratan sulfate chains contain a mixture of nonsulfated (Galβ4GlcNAcβ3), monosulfated (Galβ4GlcNAc6Sβ3), and disulfated (Gal6Sβ4GlcNAc6Sβ3) disaccharide units (Figure 17.2). The biosynthesis of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone is described in Chapter 14. At least two classes of sulfotransferases, one or more N-acetylglucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferases (e.g., CHST4 or CHST6), and one or two galactosyl 6-O-sulfotransferases (CHST1 and CHST3) catalyze the sulfation reactions. These enzymes, like other sulfotransferases, use activated sulfate (PAPS [3′-phosphoadenyl-5′-phosphosulfate]) as a high-energy donor (Chapter 5). 6-O-Sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine occurs on the nonreducing terminal residue, encouraging further chain elongation, whereas sulfation of galactose residues takes place on nonreducing terminal and internal galactose residues, with a preference for galactose units adjacent to a sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residue. Sulfation of a nonreducing terminal galactose residue blocks further elongation of the chain, providing a potential mechanism for controlling chain length. The poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains of KS I are generally longer than those of KS II and may contain up to 50 disaccharide units (20–25 kDa). The chains can be fucosylated and sialylated as well (Chapter 14). Vertebrate chondroitin sulfate consists of repeating sulfate-substituted GalNAcβ4GlcAβ3 disaccharides polymerized into long chains (Figure 17.2). In contrast, invertebrates such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster make either nonsulfated or low sulfated chains. The assembly process for the backbone appears to be highly conserved, based on the presence of homologous genes for all of the reactions (Chapters 25 and 26). As described above, the assembly process is initiated by the transfer of GalNAcβ3 to the linkage tetrasaccharide (Figure 17.4). In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the polymerization step is catalyzed by one or more bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both β3 glucuronosyltransferase and β4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Vertebrates also express homologs that can transfer individual sugars to the chain. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF), a protein that lacks independent activity but collaborates with the polymerases to enhance the formation of polymers. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues (Figure 17.5).'
 'The membrane-bound proteoglycans are diverse. The syndecan family consists of four members, each with a short hydrophobic domain that spans the membrane, linking the larger extracellular domain containing the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites to a smaller intracellular cytoplasmic domain. The syndecans are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and facilitate cellular interactions with a wide range of extracellular ligands, such as growth factors and matrix molecules. Because of their membrane-spanning properties, the syndecans can transmit signals from the extracellular environment to the intracellular cytoskeleton via their cytoplasmic tails. Syndecans are sensitive to proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteases, resulting in shedding of the ectodomains bearing the glycosaminoglycan chains that retain potent biological activity (Chapter 38). C. elegans and D. melanogaster express only one syndecan (Chapters 25 and 26). Glypicans carry only HS chains, which can bind a wide array of factors essential for development and morphogenesis. Six glypican family members exist in mammals, and only two are expressed in D. melanogaster and C. elegans. Each member of the glypican family of cell-surface proteoglycans has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attached at the carboxyl terminus, which embeds them in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Chapter 12). The amino-terminal portion of the protein has multiple cysteine residues and a globular shape that distinguishes the glypicans from the syndecan ectodomains, which tend to be extended structures (Figure 17.1). A number of other membrane proteoglycans are expressed on the surface of many different cell types including the widespread CD44, NG2 (also known as CSPG4), phosphacan (PTPζ), thrombomodulin, and invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II system. Serglycin is the major cytoplasmic secretory granule proteoglycan that is present in endothelial, endocrine, and hematopoietic cells. Depending on the species, it has a variable number of glycosaminoglycan attachment sites that can carry chondroitin sulfate or heparin chains. In fact, many proteoglycans show variation in the degree of substitution by GAG chains, giving rise in some cases to so-called “part-time” proteoglycans. To a large extent, the biological functions of proteoglycans depend on the interaction of the glycosaminoglycan chains with different protein ligands. However, the protein core determines when and where expression takes place and can itself interact with other components of the extracellular environment and the cytoskeleton. Table 38.1 lists examples of proteins known to interact with glycosaminoglycans. Proteins that bind to the sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains appear to have evolved by convergent evolution (i.e., they do not contain a specific fold present in all glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins, in contrast to other groups of glycan-binding proteins). These interactions have profound physiological effects and are discussed further in Chapter 38. Different subtypes of sulfated glycosaminoglycans are attached to their core proteins by unique linkages. There are two types of keratan sulfate, distinguished by the nature of their linkage to protein (Figure 17.3). KS I, originally detected in cornea, is found on an N-glycan linked to protein through an asparagine residue (Chapter 9). KS II (skeletal keratan sulfate) is found on an O-glycan core 2 structure and is thus linked through N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine (Chapter 10). The structural features in control of keratan sulfate substitution remain unclear, as the underlying poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone can be found on many other glycoproteins.']","In terms of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), chondroitin and heparan sulfate (CS and HS) have been detected in C. elegans, but neither keratan sulfate (KS), dermatan sulfate (DS), nor hyaluronan; whereas the CS chains contain a low amount of sulfate, the overall structure of HS in C. elegans is similar to the chains elaborated by vertebrates.","Enzymatic and genomic data indicate that there are various domain-specific forms of glycosylation in C. elegans, including O-fucose (Fucα1-Ser/Thr) on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), in the context of precise consensus sequences (Chapter 13), C-mannosylation of TSRs, and TMTC-dependent O-mannosylation of cadherins. However, POMT-mediated O-mannosylation of dystroglycan is absent. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in C. elegans can be modified with O-GlcNAc as in other animals.

This chapter describes glycosylation in the Arthropoda, focusing primarily on Drosophila melanogaster. The major glycan classes are similar to those described in vertebrates, with interesting differences. The powerful genetic systems available for studying gene function in D. melanogaster have proved to be effective means for understanding glycan function in early development and have provided some of the first examples of how glycans affect growth factor signaling, morphogen gradients, protein secretion, and neural function in vivo. Arthropods are among the most successful species on Earth and are found in all types of environments. One of their characteristic features is an exoskeleton composed of chitin, which provides support and physical protection. The best-studied example is the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. In 1910, T.H. Morgan published the first paper about the genetics of D. melanogaster, which showed that white eye color was a sex-linked trait. Since then, this organism has been the predominant model organism for genetic analysis in animals. Its advantages include an easily studied developmental program, a sequenced and actively annotated genome, a relatively complex neural system, and the ability to discern literally thousands of different phenotypes in morphology, development, and behavior. In pursuit of genes that regulate development, many Drosophila geneticists ran head-on into glycans. New analytical techniques have expanded the appreciation for the glycan synthetic capacity of the organism and have helped establish links between interesting phenotypes and altered glycan expression. Some of these associations have proven to be common across species and others are unique to D. melanogaster. Given the complexity of glycosylation in Drosophila, it is impossible to cover all aspects of glycans and glycan-binding proteins in this organism. Instead, we provide an overview of the major classes of arthropod glycans and examples of how studying glycans in Drosophila can lead to new discoveries that impact vertebrate as well as invertebrate biology. Although it was once thought that arthropod glycoproteins were exclusively of the high-mannose or paucimannose type (Chapter 9), annotation of the D. melanogaster genome predicted the existence of the enzymatic machinery needed to generate hybrid and complex glycans. Moreover, improved analytic techniques allowed the detection of very minor glycans. The commercial and experimental demand for eukaryotic expression systems led to the characterization of the glycosylation pathways of cells derived from the moth Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9 cells) and from D. melanogaster (S2 cells). It is now clear that high-mannose and paucimannose glycans account for >90% of the total N-linked glycan diversity in Drosophila and other insects throughout their life cycles. However, hybrid and complex glycans, including sialylated, sulfated, glucuronylated, and zwitterionic structures, are also present, albeit as minor components (Figure 26.1). N-Linked glycan diversity in Drosophila and other insects. N-Linked glycan processing after endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase trimming to the Man5GlcNAc2 structure is shown.

Fucα1-3GlcNAc is immunogenic in humans and rabbits, resulting in the production of antibodies against the so-called horseradish peroxidase (HRP) epitope.'
 'Genes that affect the synthesis or function of Drosophila glycans  Mutations in genes responsible for subsequent processing steps have begun to reveal the importance of glycan complexity in Drosophila. Reduction in the activity of the Fdl hexosaminidase results in altered brain structure. Brain lobes, normally separated in wild-type adults, are fused together through a continuous stalk at the midline in fdl mutants, hence, the original name of the mutation, fused lobes (Figure 26.2). In the wild-type adult, the separated lobes form portions of the mushroom body, a brain structure whose function has been implicated in Drosophila learning and memory. In an interesting convergence, a null mutation in Mgat1 generates an apparently identical fused-lobes phenotype, although the glycan expression profile shifts from more complex in fdl mutants to high mannose and paucimannose in Mgat1 mutants. It is still unclear how loss of complex glycans in one case (Mgat1) or enrichment of complex glycans in another case (fdl) generates the same neural phenotype. Mgat1 mutants also show reduced locomotor activity and decreased life span. The decreased life span is rescued by re-expression of the enzyme in neural tissue alone, indicating an essential role for complex glycosylation in neural functions that impact whole organism physiology. Mutations in enzymes that process complex N-linked glycans alter adult brain morphology in D. melanogaster. (A) The major lobes of the adult brain are shown in cross section. (Hatched areas) γ-lobes; (α,β) α- and β-lobes; (more...) A terminal synthetic step in the production of N-linked glycans in mammals is the addition of sialic acid residues. Genomic annotation and biochemical studies have shown that Drosophila possesses some, but not all, of the biosynthetic machinery necessary for the production of CMP-NeuAc. A single SiaT identified in Drosophila shows a two-fold preference for transferring sialic acid to a LacdiNAc (GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc) acceptor compared to a type II LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) acceptor. However, the only identified sialylated N-linked glycans in Drosophila possess subterminal LacNAc instead of LacdiNAc, despite the presence of LacdiNAc terminated N-linked glycans in the organism. SiaT is detected in a very small number of neurons beginning in late embryonic stages, but expands to a larger number of central nervous system (CNS) neurons in larval and adult stages. The relatively restricted expression of the SiaT enzyme reinforces proposals that minor glycans may be restricted to small subsets of cells in specific developmental or adult stages (Chapter 7). In fact, loss of glycoprotein sialylation results in explicit neurologic defects in adult flies, including behavioral abnormalities and temperature-induced seizures, indicating the importance of this minor modification of complex glycans for normal neurophysiological function. Insects add glycans in O-linkage to serine and threonine residues on secreted, cell-surface, and intracellular proteins. Structural complexity ranges from single monosaccharides (N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, glucose, or fucose) to extensively modified glycosaminoglycan chains) (see below). The core-1 structure (Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Thr/Ser), which is found extensively on vertebrate mucin-like proteins (Chapter 10), has also been described in insects (Figure 26.3). As much as 40% of the total mass of these proteins is contributed by glycans. In Drosophila tissues, peanut agglutinin lectin and mucin-specific antibodies reveal developmentally regulated and spatially restricted expression of Galβ1-3GalNAcα-O-protein moieties. O-Linked glycan diversity in Drosophila and other insects.'

O-Linked glycan diversity in Drosophila and other insects. Genetic and biochemical analysis of Drosophila mutants were instrumental in defining developmental roles for domain-specific, simple mono-, di- or trisaccharide modifications on serine/threonine (more...) Drosophila possesses a family of 10 polypeptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcT/PGANTs encoded by pgant genes; Chapter 10). Systematic mutational and RNAi-mediated knockdown analysis of individual pgant genes showed that pgant4, 5, 7, and 35A are essential for viability. Loss of pgant3 impacts extracellular matrix secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion during development, and pgant4 modulates proteolytic cleavage of substrates essential for secretory granule formation. Loss of pgant4 also results in loss of the secreted peritrophic membrane of the digestive tract, leading to disruption of the progenitor cell niche. pgant9 affects glycosylation of certain mucins and the morphology of secretory granules. Thus, mucin-type O-glycosylation in Drosophila regulates essential developmental programs and modulates trafficking through the secretory pathway, providing blueprints for studying similar functions in vertebrate systems. Once initiated by ppGalNAcT/PGANT enzymes, the extension of mucin type glycans in Drosophila results in the production of three different core structures. Core 1 structures predominate, but core 2 glycans are also present, as well as an incompletely defined HexNAc-HexNAc core. A family of core 1 galactosyltransferases (C1GalTs) exists in Drosophila and the loss of certain members disrupts the nervous system and neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). Each core type can be modified by the addition of glucuronic acid (GlcA), either as a terminal or as a branching residue. Loss of the glucuronic acid transferase GlcAT-P results in the loss of glucuronic acid on core 1 structures and results in nervous system defects and alterations in the NMJs. Glucuronic acid is also detected as an internal residue within an extended chain, reminiscent of a glycosaminoglycan disaccharide structural unit (Chapter 17) or of the matriglycan repeat on mammalian dystroglycan (Chapter 13). In Drosophila and mosquito, sulfated mucin type glycans are also detected. Species-specific expression also exists with regard to the relative abundance of different core structures and the existence of specific postsynthetic modifications. For example, O-glycans can be decorated with phosphoethanolamine linked to HexNAc residues in mosquito and wasp species, but not in Drosophila. Other types of O-linked glycan modifications are also present in insects. The discovery that O-GlcNAc decorates protein components of the Drosophila polytene chromosome added weight to initial demonstrations of the existence of nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation in animal cells (Chapters 18 and 19). Subsequently, this finding was reinforced by the observation that the gene encoding the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), was affected in super sex combs (sxc) mutants. The sxc locus is one of several polycomb group (PcG) genes that function as homeotic regulators of gene expression along the antero-posterior axis during Drosophila development. In a dramatic convergence of independent studies, major sites of PcG binding along the Drosophila genome were also shown to be major sites of genomic O-GlcNAc modification, indicating that addition of O-GlcNAc to DNA-binding proteins regulates their genomic binding specificity. Additionally, O-GlcNAc is also added to secreted and membrane proteins by the extracellular O-GlcNAc transferase EOGT.'
 'Fucα1-3GlcNAc is immunogenic in humans and rabbits, resulting in the production of antibodies against the so-called horseradish peroxidase (HRP) epitope. Anti-HRP antibodies show that the Fucα1-3GlcNAc epitope is restricted primarily to neural tissue in a broad range of arthropods. Drosophila does not extend its core fucose residues with additional capping monosaccharides nor modify its N-linked glycans by O-methylation, both of which occur extensively in Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25). The demonstration of fucosylated, sialylated, sulfated, hybrid, biantennary complex, and triantennary complex glycans in all stages of the D. melanogaster life cycle makes the diversity of the arthropod N-glycans generally comparable to that of mammals (Chapter 27), except for the very limited use of sialic acids (Sias). The relative paucity of complex N-linked glycans in Drosophila has been attributed at least partially to the presence of a hexosaminidase in the secretory pathway. Encoded by the fused lobes (fdl) gene, the enzyme is capable of efficiently removing N-acetylglucosamine residues that are added by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcT-I encoded by Mgat1) to the nonreducing terminal Manα1-3 arm of the Man5GlcNAc2 core glycan. GlcNAcT-I catalyzes the first committed step toward the generation of hybrid or complex glycans (Chapter 9). Therefore, removal of this N-acetylglucosamine residue effectively blocks subsequent extension reactions, generating the observed predominance of high-mannose or paucimannose glycans on glycoproteins. The presence of hybrid and complex glycans in Drosophila predicts the existence of specific enzymes that act on acceptor substrates that have escaped trimming by Fdl. For instance, α1-6 fucosyltransferase, GlcNAcT-I, -II, -III, -IV, galactosyltransferase (GalT), and sialyltransferase (SiaT) activities are required to generate structures more complex than paucimannose glycans. Of these enzymes, only GlcNAcT-I and the single SiaT are reasonably well-characterized in Drosophila. Genome annotations predict the existence of the other enzymes, although their activity and expression have not been characterized. Phenotypes have been described for mutations in key N-linked glycan processing and synthetic enzymes (Table 26.1). Loss of the Golgi-trimming enzyme, α1-2-mannosidase (Golgi mannosidase I, mas1) has little or no impact on the processing of high-mannose glycans, which led to the identification of an alternative mannosidase activity that effectively bypasses loss of mannosidase I. However, the embryonic peripheral nervous system, the wing, and the adult eye show mild alterations in the Drosophila mas1 mutant, suggesting that the bypass is not complete in all tissues, similar to the tissue-specific bypass identified in mouse following targeted disruption of mouse α-mannosidase (mGMII, Golgi mannosidase II) (Chapter 9). To date, relatively few mutations in genes affecting core N-linked glycosylation have been reported in Drosophila. One exception is the glucosyltransferase Alg5, which adds glucose (Glc) to the Dol-P-GlcNAc2Man9 precursor. Mutations in the Drosophila Alg5 gene, known as wollknäuel (wol), show deficient protein secretion, extracellular matrix deposition, and cuticle elaboration, phenotypes that reflect inefficient protein glycosylation and altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. Genes that affect the synthesis or function of Drosophila glycans  Mutations in genes responsible for subsequent processing steps have begun to reveal the importance of glycan complexity in Drosophila. Reduction in the activity of the Fdl hexosaminidase results in altered brain structure.'
 'Glycosphingolipid glycan diversity. The arthroseries glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are built by extension from a mactosylceramide core (Manβ1-4Glcβ-ceramide). Neutral arthroseries glycans are frequently modified by the addition of phosphoethanolamine (more...) Vertebrates generally build GSLs on a lactosylceramide core (Galβ1-4Glcβ-ceramide). In contrast, the arthropods add a mannose residue to Glcβ-Cer to generate a core (Manβ1-4Glcβ-ceramide), called “mactosylceramide.” Addition of the next two monosaccharides, N-acetylglucosamine in β1-3 linkage to the underlying mannose and a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine in β1-4 linkage, produces a substrate for the addition of ethanolamine-phosphate (EthNP) to C-6 of N-acetylglucosamine (EthNP-6GlcNAcβ1-3Manβ1-4Glcβ-Cer). Therefore, the neutral core of most arthroseries glycolipids is more correctly described as zwitterionic rather than neutral. Arthroseries cores with more than one N-acetylglucosamine residue are found with zero, one, or two EthNP groups. The functional significance of EthNP modification is currently unknown. Additional species-specific core diversity has also been identified. For example, the arthroseries triosylceramide in Drosophila can be alternatively extended with galactose rather than N-acetylgalactosamine, followed by addition of glucuronic acid (Figure 26.6). Other arthropod species add galactose to mactosylceramide or to the arthroseries tetraosylceramide with subsequent capping and EthNP modification (Figure 26.6). The expanding diversity of alternative core extensions detected in arthropods provides a larger pool of structural variants from which these organisms can tailor GSL expression for specific developmental or tissue-restricted functions, similar to core switching in vertebrate species (Chapter 11). Mutations that affect the first steps in Drosophila GSL synthesis were originally identified as modulators of cell fate. Biochemical analysis showed that genes called egghead (egh) and brainiac (brn), respectively, encode the mannosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that add the second and third monosaccharide residues (Figure 26.6). Phenotypes associated with loss of maternal and zygotic egh and brn include overproliferation of neural cells at the expense of epithelial lineages. These egh/brn phenotypes closely resemble the embryonic phenotype of mutations in the Notch gene (Figure 26.4). An additional phenotype of egh mutants is the formation of enlarged peripheral nerves due to glial cell overproliferation with immune cell infiltration, reminiscent of the human disorder neurofibromatosis type 1. As in this human disorder, overgrowth results from enhanced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity, likely because of reduced Ras signaling. The neurofibromatosis-like phenotypes indicate the importance of the membrane glycolipid environment for propagating appropriate transmembrane signals. Mutations affecting the two partially redundant N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases that generate the tetraosylceramide of the arthroseries result in subtle behavioral phenotypes in larvae and altered EGF receptor signaling in ovarian follicle cells, but otherwise produce viable, fertile adults. It remains to be determined whether arthroseries glycans elongated beyond the tetraosylceramide possess structural information that imparts specific function. Annotation of the Drosophila genome indicates the presence of representatives for each of the known classes of animal lectins (Chapter 28). Intracellular carbohydrate-binding proteins, which in vertebrates are associated with protein folding and quality control in the ER or with trafficking through the early compartments of the secretory pathway (calnexin, calreticulin, VIP, ERGIC-53), are also found in Drosophila (Chapter 39).']","The chapter provides insights into glycosylation in Arthropoda, particularly focusing on Drosophila melanogaster. It highlights the similarities of major glycan classes with vertebrates, along with notable differences. The genetic systems in D. melanogaster have been instrumental in studying gene function, revealing the impact of glycans on growth factor signaling, morphogen gradients, protein secretion, and neural function during early development.","Arthropods are among the most successful species on Earth and are found in all types of environments. One of their characteristic features is an exoskeleton composed of chitin, which provides support and physical protection. The best-studied example is the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. In 1910, T.H. Morgan published the first paper about the genetics of D. melanogaster, which showed that white eye color was a sex-linked trait. Since then, this organism has been the predominant model organism for genetic analysis in animals. Its advantages include an easily studied developmental program, a sequenced and actively annotated genome, a relatively complex neural system, and the ability to discern literally thousands of different phenotypes in morphology, development, and behavior.

About 80% of the weight of egg jelly is a high-molecular-weight linear fucose (Fuc) sulfate polymer (FSP) with a molecular mass of >106 Da. Receptor proteins on sperm bind to FSP, triggering the opening of two pharmacologically distinct calcium channels that induce the exocytosis of the sperm's acrosome vesicle (the “acrosome reaction”). The ionic mechanisms that trigger the acrosome reaction are conserved in mammals, but the nature of the sperm surface receptors varies. FSP is a species-selective inducer of the sea urchin sperm acrosomal reaction and most FSPs are sulfated α1-3Fuc-based linear polymers made of tri- or tetrasaccharide repeats. The number of fucoses per repeat, the linkage, and sulfation patterns all help ensure species selectivity for induction of the acrosome reaction. About 20% of the egg jelly mass is a large glycoprotein containing a unique polymer of sialic acid (Sia), which can be released from crude sea urchin egg jelly by treatment with mild base (β-elimination). The sialoglycan has a novel structure—[Neu5Gcα2-5-O-glycolylNeu5Gc]n. However, its receptor on the sperm membrane is unknown. When sea urchin sperm undergo the acrosome reaction, a protein named bindin is released from the acrosomal vesicle. Bindin cements the sperm to a large egg surface glycoprotein named egg bindin receptor 1 (EBR1). Bindin can agglutinate mammalian red blood cells much like plant lectins (Chapter 32), and glycopeptide fragments of unfertilized eggs can block bindin-induced red cell agglutination. Bindin is thought to recognize glycans on EBR1. EBR1 itself has lectin-like domains, but its glycan ligands are unknown. Most studies of glycosylation in sea urchins have identified glycosyltransferase activities and the glycans they synthesize (e.g., including N-glycans with antennal β1-3-linked Gal, β1-4GalNAc, Neu5Gc, and sulphate residues as well as traces of the “invertebrate” feature of core α1-3/α1-6-difucosylation) (Figure 27.2). The functions of glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) can be investigated using genetic strategies in sea urchins, antisense morpholinos or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down gene expression have been the methods of choice, but these will likely be superseded by more precise gene editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) strategy or transcription activator–like effector (TALE) nucleases (TALENs).

This chapter discusses some general features of glycosylation and glycan-binding interactions in a few examples of species that belong to the deuterostome lineage, with particular emphasis on sea urchins, frogs, zebrafish, and mice. These organisms provide excellent models for studying the functions of glycans in development and physiology. Animal evolution split into two major lineages ∼500–600 million years ago—the deuterostomes and the protostomes (Chapter 20). The superphylum Deuterostomia contains the major phyla of Echinodermata (sea urchins and starfish), Hemichordata (acorn worms), Urochordata (ascidians), Cephalochordata (amphioxus), and Vertebrata (fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals). In deuterostomes, cell divisions of the zygote occur by radial cleavage, and cell fates are not precisely determined. Another characteristic feature is that the first opening to form in the blastula becomes the anus and the second opening becomes the mouth. The other superphylum, the Protostomia, contains the major phyla of Porifera (corals and sponges), Cnidara (anemones and hydra), Annelida (segmented worms), Mollusca (clams, oysters, snails, and slugs), and Arthropoda (insects, spiders, and crustacea). In protostomes, unlike deuterostomes, cell division during early development occurs in a highly organized manner and cell fate is precisely determined. Examples of well-studied protostome model organisms include the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25) and the arthropod Drosophila melanogaster (Chapter 26). Deuterostomes have been extensively studied because of their relatedness to humans and because they provide excellent model systems for understanding vertebrate biology. Sea urchins, frogs, zebrafish, and mice have received the most attention and each provides certain advantages for studying functions of glycans in reproduction, early development, or adult physiology. In numerous instances, these models have revealed aspects of glycobiology that were later confirmed in more evolutionarily distant organisms, and they often serve as excellent models for understanding human disease. Challenges exist, however, in describing the glycomes of the more ancient deuterostomes, mainly because of poor genome annotation, ignorance of individual glycosyltransferase substrates, and the presence of glycans with unusual structures. Each of these models is briefly described below with references to other sections of the book for additional details. Sea urchin glycans involved in fertilization have been studied extensively. In fact, much of what we know about the biochemistry of fertilization was first discovered in this organism (Figure 27.1), and the information subsequently applied to mammalian sperm–egg interactions. One of the advantages of studying fertilization in sea urchins is that eggs and sperm are easy to obtain in large quantities. Because fertilization occurs outside the adult body, it is also easy to experimentally manipulate sperm and eggs. (Top left) The purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.

 'Adults are easy to maintain and can be induced to lay eggs up to three times a year by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin. The very large eggs allow easy microinjection experiments to express exogenous cDNAs encoding RNAs and proteins of interest. Although frog embryos develop quickly, the generation time for adults is long (1–2 yr), and the frog genome is tetraploid, making genetic studies difficult. Nevertheless, as for sea urchins, inhibition of gene expression has been accomplished by injection of antisense morpholinos or shRNAs into early embryos. These techniques suffer from off-target effects and the future will see a shift to newer gene editing strategies including CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs. In addition, in situ hybridization and overexpression techniques have been used in Xenopus embryos. For example, the functions of two polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases in transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenic protein signaling were distinguished, showing that this organism is useful for discovering glycan biosynthetic steps and mechanisms by which glycans regulate development. Indeed, developmental changes in the X. laevis N-glycome (Figure 27.2) have been reported, whereas the O-glycans of frog egg mucins can be extremely complicated in a species-dependent manner. X. laevis oocyte cortical granules contain a lectin called XL35, which is released at fertilization and binds to glycoproteins expressing mucin-type O-glycans (Galα1-3GalNAc) in the jelly surrounding the egg. XL35 is an oligomer made up of monomers, each of which has a molecular weight of 35 kDa. Light scattering experiments showed that the oligomer exists primarily as a 12-mer, allowing it to cross-link its glycoprotein ligands in the egg jelly to form a relatively rigid layer on the fertilization envelope. This molecular complex functions to block polyspermy and also serves as a barrier against microbial infection. Homologs of XL35, known as “X-lectins,” exist in some of the most primitive deuterostomes, such as the sea squirt, but also in more complex vertebrates such as zebrafish, mice, and humans. Mice and humans have two orthologs termed intelectins-1 and -2 (Chapter 30) because of their initial discovery in the intestines. It is interesting to note that the sea squirt homolog (Halocynthia roretzi) shows a similar monomeric molecular weight to human intelectin 1 (Hint-1) and is 34% identical at the amino acid level. Hint-1 exists as a trimer when secreted from goblet cells in intestinal and respiratory epithelia. IL-13, a cytokine involved in the type TII innate immune response, induces a remarkable increase in Hint-1 transcripts. Constitutively expressed transcripts for Hint-1 are also found in heart and lung tissue. Hint-2, in contrast, is only expressed in Paneth cells that function in immune surveillance in the crypts of the small intestine. Glycan microarray results show that both Hints bind to the glycans of a unique set of human pathogenic bacteria that have in common the presence of particular cis-diols on their outer surface polysaccharides and include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Crystal structures of Hint-1 and the Xenopus embryonic epidermal lectin show a conserved mechanism of glycan recognition. But clearly, the carbohydrate binding determinants for each intelectin studied are unique. It is becoming clear that the X-lectin family plays key roles in deuterostome innate immune responses against pathogens. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) provides an excellent model organism for understanding the functions of genes in early vertebrate development (Figure 27.3). Females lay several hundred eggs weekly, which undergo external fertilization. Embryos develop rapidly (in hours), and their translucence allows visualization of early development. Zebrafish are relatively easy to maintain compared with other vertebrate species.'

Etzler, and Ajit Varki. This chapter provides an overview of naturally occurring glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), the history of their discovery, some of their biological functions, ways in which GBPs are identified, and challenges in defining their biologically relevant ligands. The chapters that follow describe the analysis of glycan–protein interactions (Chapter 29), the physical principles involved (Chapter 30), and the structures and biological functions of important subclasses of GBPs (Chapters 31–38). GBPs (which exclude glycan-specific antibodies) are found in all living organisms and fall into two overarching groups—lectins and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (compared in Online Appendix 28A). Lectins are further classified into evolutionarily related families identified by carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) based on primary and/or three-dimensional structural similarities (Figure 28.1). CRDs can exist as stand-alone proteins or as domains within larger multidomain proteins. They typically recognize terminal groups on glycans, which fit into shallow but well-defined binding pockets (Chapters 29 and 30). In contrast, proteins that bind to sulfated GAGs (heparan, chondroitin, dermatan, and keratan sulfates; Chapter 17) do so via clusters of positively charged amino acids that bind specific arrangements of carboxylic acid and sulfate groups along GAG chains. Most of these proteins are evolutionarily unrelated. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GAG hyaluronic acid (hyaladherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that facilitates recognition of short segments of the invariant hyaluronan repeating disaccharide (Chapter 16), so they are best classified as lectins rather than grouped with sulfated GAG-binding proteins. The rest of this chapter emphasizes lectins, different families of which are detailed in Chapters 31–37. Sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also discussed, and are detailed further in Chapter 38. Representative structures from four common animal lectin families. The emphasis is on the extracellular domain structure and topology. The following are the defined carbohydrate-binding domains (CRDs) shown: (CL) C-type lectin; (GL) galectin; (MP) P-type (more...) Lectins were discovered in plants in 1888 when extracts of castor bean seeds were found to agglutinate animal red blood cells. Subsequently, seeds of many plants were found to contain such “agglutinins,” later renamed lectins (Latin for “select”) when they were found to distinguish human ABO blood groups (Chapter 14), important for blood transfusions. Lectins are particularly common in the seeds of leguminous plants and these “L-type” lectins, including concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin, have been extensively studied. Although their specific glycan-binding activities make such plant lectins extremely useful scientific tools, their biological functions in plants remain mostly unknown. The first animal lectin discovered was the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) identified by Anatol Morell and Gilbert Ashwell in the late 1960s during investigations of the turnover of a serum glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin. Like most glycoproteins circulating in blood, ceruloplasmin has complex N-glycans with sialic acid termini. To prepare radiolabeled ceruloplasmin, the terminal sialic acids were removed, leaving an exposed galactose. Surprisingly, asialoceruloplasmin had a circulation half-life (in rabbits) of minutes, whereas intact ceruloplasmin remained in the blood for hours.'
 'These interactions can take various forms, resulting in movement of molecules, cells, and information. Directing movement of glycoproteins within and between cells is a common function for lectins in many organisms. In eukaryotic cells, including yeast as well as “higher” eukaryotes, several groups of lectins are important in glycoprotein biosynthesis and intracellular movement (Chapter 39). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), two lectins—calnexin and calreticulin—bind monoglucosylated high-mannose glycans present on newly synthesized glycoproteins, forming part of a quality control system for protein folding. This binding keeps proteins in the ER until they are correctly folded. Other groups of lectins in the ER, including M-type lectins and proteins containing mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domains, take part in the process of ER-associated glycoprotein degradation (ERAD), binding partially processed high-mannose glycans on terminally misfolded glycoproteins, causing them to be retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm for deglycosylation, followed by degradation in the proteasome. One of the best characterized functions of GBPs is in delivery of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi to lysosomes. P-type lectins (Chapter 33) recognize mannose 6-phosphate residues that have been added to N-glycans on lysosomal enzymes in the Golgi apparatus, targeting them to endosomes for fusion with lysosomes. Once released from cells, glycoproteins can also be taken up for degradation in lysosomes. As noted above, the ASGPR on mammalian hepatocytes controls turnover of many serum glycoproteins by recognition of terminal Gal or GalNAc residues. Similarly, the mannose receptor on macrophages and sinusoidal cells of the liver binds and clears glycoproteins with oligomannose N-glycans that are released from cells during inflammation and tissue damage. Not all lectin-mediated targeting leads to degradation. Glycan-binding subunits of secreted bacterial and plant toxins typically target them to glycolipids on cell surfaces and facilitate entry of the toxins into cells (Chapter 37). Many enzymes contain glycan-binding domains that bring another domain with enzyme activity into close proximity with its substrates. One notable group includes bacterial cellulases in which cellulose-binding modules position the enzymatic domain for optimal degradation of cellulose fibers. Following a similar principle, GalNAc-binding domains in polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases that initiate O-linked glycosylation in animals position these enzymes to add further GalNAc residues to regions of polypeptides that already bear O-glycans (Chapter 10). Distinctive glycans on the surfaces of different eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells make them targets for GBPs. Binding of glycans on the surface of one cell by GBPs on an adjacent cell can induce recognition and adhesion, whereas cross-linking glycans on different cells by multivalent soluble lectins provides an alternative mechanism. Such interactions are exploited in specialized situations exemplified by transient contacts between moving cells. The selectins—three receptors that function in interactions between white blood cells, platelets, and endothelia—provide some of the best characterized examples of lectin–glycan interactions in cell–cell adhesion (Chapter 34). For example, L-selectin on lymphocytes binds glycans on specialized endothelial cells of lymph nodes to induce lymphocyte homing, wherein circulating lymphocytes leave the bloodstream and enter the lymph node. Other mammalian GBPs that mediate binding of cells to each other or that recognize ligands on the same cell surface include Siglecs (Chapter 35) and galectins (Chapter 36). Lectins in multicellular organisms also mediate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix and support the organization of matrix components. For example, proteins containing link modules that bind specifically to hyaluronan in cartilage (and other tissues) are essential for structuring the extracellular matrix (Chapter 38), and other extracellular proteins bind to sulfated GAGs to organize cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (Chapter 38). Many bacteria also use lectins to adhere to glycans on host cells, often keeping them from getting washed away.']","The protein bindin, released from the acrosomal vesicle during the acrosome reaction in sea urchin sperm, plays a crucial role in binding the sperm to the egg surface glycoprotein EBR1. Bindin exhibits agglutination properties similar to plant lectins, and experiments have shown that glycopeptide fragments from unfertilized eggs can effectively inhibit bindin-induced agglutination of mammalian red blood cells.","Bindin is thought to recognize glycans on EBR1. EBR1 itself has lectin-like domains, but its glycan ligands are unknown. Most studies of glycosylation in sea urchins have identified glycosyltransferase activities and the glycans they synthesize (e.g., including N-glycans with antennal β1-3-linked Gal, β1-4GalNAc, Neu5Gc, and sulphate residues as well as traces of the “invertebrate” feature of core α1-3/α1-6-difucosylation) (Figure 27.2). The functions of glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) can be investigated using genetic strategies in sea urchins, antisense morpholinos or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down gene expression have been the methods of choice, but these will likely be superseded by more precise gene editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) strategy or transcription activator–like effector (TALE) nucleases (TALENs).",1.0,0.6381702146013302,0.6443707882345436,0.022058823529411766,0.999999999975,1.0
"Complete the following paragraph: A wide variety of methods for coupling monosaccharides and complex glycans to create affinity resins have been developed. As mentioned above, many sulfated-GAG-binding proteins have been discovered by affinity chromatography using immobilized GAG chains.","['The binding of L-PHA is used to identify specific types of branched N-glycans in cells. L-PHA binding is dramatically decreased in mice genetically null for the branching β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT5 and -5B) (Chapter 9). The expression of L- or E-PHA-binding glycoproteins is increased in many tumor cells (Chapter 47). Similar studies show E-PHA binds bisected complex-type N-glycans containing the GlcNAcβ1-4Man-R in the core, and such structures are produced by MGAT3, and E-PHA-binding glycans are also elevated in some tumor cells. Thus, using a variety of lectins and antibodies, it is possible to deduce many aspects of glycan structures. Microarrays in which a variety of lectins and antibodies are printed on a slide can also give valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. This approach is especially sensitive in regard to defining whether biological samples differ in glycosylation. For example, such microarrays have been used to identify glycosylation differences in melanoma metastasis, leading to the identification of core fucose as a critical determinant of metastatic potential. There are several approaches to using antibodies and lectins in glycan purification, including affinity chromatography or affinity binding and immunoprecipitation or lectin-induced precipitation. The proteins may be covalently coupled to a carrier such as Sepharose or biotinylated and captured on streptavidin-Sepharose. In addition, antibodies may be noncovalently captured on protein A (or G)-Sepharose. These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants. ConA-Sepharose is commonly used to isolate glycoproteins as it shows little binding to nonglycosylated proteins. However, it does not bind all glycoproteins because it recognizes specific N-glycan structures. ConA-Sepharose has also been used to isolate free oligo- and polymannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary N-glycans. When combined in a serial format, multiple lectins can be used in affinity chromatography to isolate glycoconjugates containing most of the major glycan structures present in animal cells, with glycoconjugates being separated as classes that share common determinants. An example of serial lectin affinity chromatography is shown in Figure 48.8. Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications. Release of glycans coupled with ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can yield highly pure glycans with predicted structures that can then be confirmed by mass spectrometry of native and permethylated derivatives (Chapters 50 and 51). An example of the use of different immobilized plant lectins in serial lectin affinity chromatography of complex mixtures of glycopeptides. In this example, a mixture of glycopeptides is applied to a column of immobilized concanavalin A (ConA), and the (more...) Mixed-bed lectin chromatography using a combination of different immobilized lectins is useful for simultaneously separating all types of glycoconjugates from nonglycosylated material (e.g., glycopeptides from peptides). Combinations of affinity chromatography and other chromatographic techniques can be very useful in identifying and separating glycopeptides. Thus, the ability of glycans to be recognized by lectins dependent on specific structural features in the glycans is a powerful tool for glycan identification and isolation. In some approaches, the glycans are tagged at the reducing end by fluorophores and radioisotopes or may be obtained by metabolic radiolabeling from cells or tissues grown in the presence of radiolabeled sugar precursors, such as [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans.'
 'GPI-anchored proteins (Chapter 12), with their lipid, protein, and glycan constituents, have unique physicochemical properties that can be exploited for their detection. The nonionic detergent Triton X-114 at low temperature (4°C) extracts soluble and integral membrane proteins, as well as GPI-anchored proteins. When the solution is warmed, two phases separate, and GPI-anchored and other amphiphilic proteins remain associated with the detergent-enriched phase. GPI-specific phospholipases can be used to cleave GPI anchors for further characterization. Successful cleavage by GPI-specific phospholipases can be assessed using SDS-PAGE, because removal of the GPI anchor causes a shift in molecular mass. This is a common diagnostic method for identifying the presence of a GPI anchor on a protein of interest. Another method is to treat the GPI-anchored protein with nitrous acid, which cleaves the unsubstituted glucosamine residue that links the glycan to the phosphatidylinositol. This class of glycans contains many structures, including homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides, neutral and ionic polysaccharides, and linear and branched structures, with widespread molecular sizes ranging from a few monosaccharide units to thousands (Chapters 3, 21, and 22). Most of these polymers are insoluble in aqueous solutions, occurring as complex and sometimes crystalline aggregates. But many can be extracted with water, salts, chaotropic agents, or detergents and isolated by precipitation with alcohols. Detection is based on refractive index (RI) or colorimetric reactions, because sample quantity is not usually a limitation. Once the presence and general type of glycan has been established, the next challenge is to release specific types of glycans and separate different classes in sufficient quantities for structural characterization. When glycans are released before structural analysis, it is best to use a quantitative release procedure that neither destroys nor alters the glycan. Ideally, information regarding the type of linkage between the glycan and its liberated protein or lipid should be retained, although this is not always possible. Glycolipids can often be isolated and characterized by MS and/or NMR without the need for release of glycans, but, if necessary, enzymatic methods can be used, or for glycosphingolipids, ozonolysis will separate lipid from glycan. Complex, hybrid and oligomannose N-glycans can be released from glycoproteins with N-glycosidases such as PNGase F or PNGase A (Table 50.1). Endo H may be used for the selective release of high-mannose and hybrid N-glycans, but complex N-glycans are resistant (Table 50.1; Figure 50.1). Chemical approaches suitable for release of glycans from a protein include hydrazinolysis, which releases N-glycans and/or O-glycans, depending on experimental conditions. Strong base treatment can, under carefully controlled conditions, release only O-glycans in a process called β-elimination; it is generally accompanied by reduction with borohydride to give an alditol. More recently methods have been developed in which base treatment is accompanied by derivatization with pyrazolone, which acts as a UV-absorbing label during chromatographic separation. However, all of the above chemical methods can result in partial or complete loss of labile modifications of the glycan, such as O-acetylation or sulfation, and degradation of the protein. Glycans released from a glycoconjugate usually form a complex mixture. Even when only one glycosylation site in the protein is occupied, individual molecules can bear different glycan species generating multiple glycoforms. The high-throughput analysis of these glycan mixtures using glycomics technologies is described in Chapter 51. Preparation of glycan samples for structural analysis will rely on separation techniques. Chromatographic separations commonly used to isolate pure glycans, or at least glycan mixtures of reduced complexity, include size exclusion chromatography (SEC), strong or weak anion exchange chromatography (SAX or WAX), and some forms of reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).'
 'A common method involves affinity fractionation of proteins on Sepharose columns containing covalently linked GAG chains, usually heparin. The bound proteins are eluted with different concentrations of sodium chloride, and the concentration required for elution is generally proportional to the Kd. High-affinity interactions require 0.5–2 m NaCl to displace bound ligand, which usually translates into Kd values of 10−7–10−9 m (determined under physiological salt concentrations by equilibrium binding). Proteins with lower affinity (10−5–10−7 m) often require only 0.2–0.5 m NaCl to elute. This method assumes that GAG–protein interactions are entirely ionic, which is not entirely correct. Nevertheless, it can provide an assessment of relative affinity, when comparing different GAG-binding proteins. A number of more sophisticated methods are now in use that provide detailed thermodynamic data (ΔH [change in enthalpy], ΔS [change in entropy], ΔCp [change in molar heat capacity], etc.), kinetic data (association and dissociation rates), and high-resolution data on atomic contacts in GAG–protein interactions (Table 38.2). Regardless of the technique one uses, it must be kept in mind that in vitro binding measurements are not likely to be the same as those when the protein binds to proteoglycans on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix, where the density and variety of GAG-binding proteins, proteoglycans, and other interacting factors varies greatly. To determine the physiological relevance of the interaction, one should consider measuring binding under conditions that can lead to a biological response. For example, one can measure binding to cells with altered GAG composition (Chapter 49) or after treatment with specific lyases to remove GAG chains from the cell surface (Chapter 17) and then determine whether the same response occurs as observed in the presence of GAG chains. The interaction can then be studied more intensively using the in vitro assays described above. Methods to measure glycosaminoglycan (GAG)–protein interaction  As mentioned above, most GAG-binding proteins interact with HS and/or heparin. The likely basis for this preference is greater sequence heterogeneity and more extensive and variable sulfation compared with other GAGs. The unusual conformational flexibility of iduronic acid, which is found in heparin, HS, and DS, also has a role in their ability to bind proteins. GAGs are linear helical structures, consisting of alternating residues of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) with glucuronic acid (GlcA) or IdoA (with the exception of KS, which consists of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and galactose residues; Chapter 17). Inspection of heparin oligosaccharides containing highly modified domains ([GlcNS6S-IdoA2S]n) shows that the N-sulfo and 2-O-sulfo groups of each disaccharide repeat lie on opposite sides of the helix from the 6-O-sulfo and carboxyl groups (Figure 38.1). Analysis of the conformation of individual sugars shows that N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid residues assume a preferred conformation in solution, designated 4C1 (indicating that carbon 4 is above the plane defined by carbons 2, 3, and 5 and the ring oxygen, and that carbon 1 is below the plane; Chapter 2). In contrast, IdoA2S assumes the 1C4 or the 2S0 conformation (Figure 38.1), which reorients the position of the sulfo substituents, thereby creating a different orientation of charged groups. In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding. IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind.'
 'Figure 38.3D shows a model of a tetramer built on the known dimer structure (PDB id, 1U4L) and complexed with CS hexamers 4-O-sulfated on all three N-acetylgalactosamine residues of the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc repeats. Individual dimers are shown as green and sea green ribbons. Additional dimers can be added to each end to build a filament structure. The interactions between protein residues and charged groups on the CS involve a classic BBXB motif (R44, K45, N46, R47) plus a more remote arginine (R17). Each positively charged arginine is positioned to have strong electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the negatively charged carboxylate of a glucuronic acid residue and 4-O-sulfo group of the following N-acetylgalactosamine residue. The positioning of these arginine residues may be unique to CS, and other GAG segments may bind quite differently. The model of the filament in Figure 38.3D is also not unique, and both positioning of dimeric subunits and flexibility in CS binding geometry may allow longer GAG chains to cross-link adjacent dimers and facilitate oligomerization. A final point of note is that the groups responsible for interaction with the CCR5 receptor on leukocytes are near the amino terminus, a segment deeply buried in the dimer interface. These groups may be transiently exposed on filament dissociation to release monomers or they may be more permanently exposed on filament ends. Much additional structural work will be required to fully understand the function of CCL5. In some cases, the interaction of GAG chains with proteins may depend on metal cofactors. For example, L- and P-selectins have been shown to bind to a subfraction of HS chains and heparin in a divalent-cation-dependent manner. This observation raises the possibility that other examples of cation-dependent interactions with GAG chains may exist. Indeed, annexin A2 and annexin V have been shown to bind HS in a calcium-dependent manner. The co-crystal structures of annexin A2 and annexin V with heparin oligosaccharides revealed that calcium ions can either directly or indirectly (through sequestered water) participate in the interactions with HS. Another example is calcium-dependent interaction between cytokine S100A12 and HS. In this case, formation of the functional HS-binding site requires a calcium-induced conformational change of S100A12. Although the vast majority of GAG–protein interactions were identified and studied under neutral pH, quite a few GAG-binding proteins have been shown to interact with GAG only under acidic pH. Such proteins include histidine-rich glycoproteins, cystatin-C, selenoprotein P, and serum amyloid A. There is good reason to believe that the interactions between these proteins and GAG are physiologically relevant because extracellular environments with acidic pH exist under many physiological and pathological conditions. In fact, for these proteins, pH change essentially functions as an on/off switch of their interactions with GAG, which might bear physiological significances. Not surprisingly, histidines are often found in the GAG-binding site of these proteins because of its pH-dependent protonation of the imidazole ring. A main technical challenge to understand GAG–protein interactions is to dissect the essential structural elements of GAGs that contribute to the binding. Unlike researchers studying DNA-binding proteins who have access to all possible DNA sequences, researchers studying GAG-binding proteins traditionally do not have access to GAG oligosaccharides with defined structures. Fortunately, this situation has begun to change in the last 5 years. With the rapid progress of chemoenzymatic and chemical synthesis (or a combination of both) of HS/CS oligosaccharides, a growing number of structural defined oligosaccharides (dp4-dp20) have become available. Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.38 Ding Xu, James H. Prestegard, Robert J. Linhardt, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosaminoglycans bind to many different classes of proteins mostly through electrostatic interactions between negatively charged sulfate groups and uronic acids and positively charged amino acids in the protein. This chapter focuses on examples of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins, methods for measuring GAG–protein interaction, and information about three-dimensional structures of the complexes. In contrast to lectins, which tend to fall into evolutionarily conserved families (Chapters 28–37), GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds and instead appear to have evolved by convergent evolution. Several hundred GAG-binding proteins have been discovered, which make up the GAG-interactome and fall into the broad classes presented in Table 38.1. To a large extent, studies of the GAG-interactome have focused on protein interactions with heparin, a more highly sulfated, iduronic acid (IdoA)-rich form of heparan sulfate (HS; Chapter 17). This bias reflects, in part, the commercial availability of heparin and heparin-Sepharose, which are frequently used for fractionation studies, and the partially incorrect assumption that binding to heparin mimics binding to HS present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. There are also a large number of proteins known to interact with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) with comparable avidity and affinity; there are fewer examples of specific interactions with keratan sulfate (KS), but this may reflect fewer studies of KS. In some cases, CS may be the physiologically relevant ligand because CS predominates in many tissues. Determining the physiological relevance of these interactions is a major area of research. Examples of various classes of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins  Interactions between GAGs and proteins can have profound physiological effects on processes such as hemostasis, lipid transport and absorption, cell growth and migration, and development. Binding to GAGs can result in immobilization of proteins at their sites of production or in the extracellular matrix for future mobilization, regulation of enzyme activity, binding of proteins to their receptors, protein oligomerization, and protection of proteins against degradation. Several viruses and bacteria also exploit GAGs expressed in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces as attachment factors. For example, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, enters through the respiratory tract and infects epithelial cells lining the airways by interactions of the viral spike protein with heparan sulfate. The ability of virions to attach to cell-surface heparan sulfate facilitates capture of the virus and transfer to proteinaceous receptors (e.g., host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in the case of SARS-CoV-2) as well as subsequent viral glycoprotein processing and infection. The interactions of GAG-binding proteins are often driven by a general complementarity of charge (e.g., thrombin–heparin interactions). In some cases, the interaction has been shown to depend on rare but specific sequences of modified sugars in the GAG chain (e.g., antithrombin binding). Numerous methods are available for analyzing GAG–protein interactions, and some provide a direct measurement of Kd values. A common method involves affinity fractionation of proteins on Sepharose columns containing covalently linked GAG chains, usually heparin. The bound proteins are eluted with different concentrations of sodium chloride, and the concentration required for elution is generally proportional to the Kd.

The observation that many lectins fall into structurally distinct families provides an alternative way to identify novel GBPs through analysis of protein sequences. Sequence motifs characteristic of CRDs are routinely used to screen sequences from whole genome sequencing. These motifs can also be used to screen specific cDNA and gene sequences of interest because of their association with biological functions.,0.7142857142857143,0.5735186104496386,0.49732838697728143,0.024,0.6791666666496875,0.0
"Complete the following paragraph: Another variation is generally termed a “pull-down assay,” akin to a type of immunoprecipitation. In this approach a solution containing potential ligands is incubated with a GBP that may be immobilized on a surface (e.g., a bead). Afterward the bead-GBP is subjected to several steps (e.g., magnetic separation or centrifugation) to remove the unbound material.","['If a glycan or a glycosylated macromolecule binds tightly to an immobilized GBP, a buffer containing a known glycan ligand may be added to force dissociation of the complex. For example, oligomannose-type and hybrid-type N-glycans will bind avidly to an agarose column containing the plant lectin concanavalin A (ConA-agarose) and 10–100 mm α-methyl mannoside is required to elute the bound material efficiently. In contrast, many highly branched complex-type N-glycans will not bind. Biantennary complex-type N-glycans bind to ConA-agarose, but they do not bind as tightly as high-mannose-type N-glycans and their elution can be achieved using 10 mm α-methyl glucoside. In this manner, one can assess the binding specificity of a GBP. In practice, this approach is rather crude, and although it gives valuable practical information about the capacity of an immobilized lectin to bind specific glycans, it does not provide quantitative affinity measurements. A variant of this method is to immobilize the glycan ligand through covalent linkage or by capturing a biotinylated glycan on a streptavidin-linked surface and then measuring GBP binding. A more sophisticated version of this approach, termed frontal affinity chromatography, can provide quantitative measurements of the equilibrium binding constants. In this technique, a solution containing a glycan of known concentration is continuously applied to a column of immobilized GBP, and the elution front of the glycan from the column is monitored. Eventually, enough ligand is added through continuous addition that its concentration in the eluant equals that in the starting material. If the glycan has no affinity for the GBP, it will elute in the void volume V0; if, however, the glycan interacts with the GBP, it will elute after the V0 and at a volume Vf (Figure 29.3). Example of frontal affinity chromatography, in which different concentrations of a glycan are applied to a column of immobilized GBP. The profile depicts the elution of one glycan that binds the GBP and the elution of another glycan that does not bind (more...) The advantages of frontal affinity chromatography are similar to those discussed for equilibrium dialysis: (1) the approach is easy and inexpensive; (2) if the affinity is high, then relatively small amounts of protein are needed (typically a few milligrams), and only a single column is required; (3) correspondingly, small amounts of glycan may be used if the Kd is in the range of 10 nm to 10 mm; (4) if the glycans are stable, they may be recovered and reused; (5) radioactive glycans may be used; and (6) reliable equilibrium measurements can be made. There are some limitations to this approach, including (1) only the Kd can be derived, not kon or koff; (2) the conjugation of the GBP to the matrix must be stable and the protein must retain reasonable activity for many different column runs; (3) the amount of GBP conjugated and active must be defined; (4) many different column runs must be made with a single glycan; and (5) if the Kd is high (>1 mm), this approach is typically not feasible. Overall, frontal affinity chromatography is quite useful and is automated. Another variation is generally termed a “pull-down assay,” akin to a type of immunoprecipitation. In this approach a solution containing potential ligands is incubated with a GBP that may be immobilized on a surface (e.g., a bead). Afterward the bead-GBP is subjected to several steps (e.g., magnetic separation or centrifugation) to remove the unbound material. The material bound to the bead-GBP may then be eluted for measurement and further analyses. Using this pull-down setup, one can perform a concentration-dependent binding assay to obtain an apparent Ka of the ligand for the immobilized GBP. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is one of the most rigorous means of defining the equilibrium binding constant between a glycan and a GBP or indeed any protein and its ligand. The binding of a glycan to the GBP is measured as a change in enthalpy using a commercial microcalorimeter.'

The binding of a glycan to the GBP is measured as a change in enthalpy using a commercial microcalorimeter. In this technique, a solution containing a glycan of interest is added in increments into a solution containing a fixed concentration of GBP. The glycan is added at many intervals and the heat evolved from binding is measured relative to a reference cell. Over the course of the experiment, the concentration of glycan is increased in the mixing cell over a glycan-to-GBP molar ratio of 0–10. The heat absorbed or evolved during binding is determined and the data are replotted as kcal/mole of injectant versus the molar ratio (Figure 29.4). These data are then analyzed by replotting data to obtain the Kd. The heat change is directly related to the enthalpy of reaction ΔHo. From knowledge of the Kd and ΔHo, and using Equation 4, it is possible to define the binding entropy ΔSo. Example of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). (Top) Increasing amounts of a glycan are injected to a fixed amount of glycan-binding protein (GBP) in a cell, and the heat produced upon binding is measured as μcal/sec. (Bottom) The total kcal/mol (more...) The major advantage of this approach is that it can provide thermodynamic information about the binding of a glycan to a GBP and is thus superior to equilibrium dialysis and affinity chromatography. The limitations of this approach are that (1) relatively large amounts of protein may be required to conduct multiple experiments (>10 mg); (2) relatively large amounts of glycans may be required; and (3) because of the above-mentioned problem, it is not typical for such analyses to use a wide range of different glycans. Nevertheless, this approach is rigorous and if the titration cell dimensions could be decreased in the future, then lower amounts of materials would be required. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is used to measure association and dissociation kinetics of ligands (analytes) with a receptor. In SPR, the association of the analyte and receptor, with one or the other immobilized on a sensor chip, which incorporates a critical metal sensing surface, induces a change in total surface plasmon waves resulting in a change in the refractive index of the layer in contact with a gold film (Figure 29.5). This change is recorded as the SPR signal or resonance units (RUs). Binding is measured in real time, and information about the association and dissociation kinetics can thus be obtained, which in turn can be used to obtain Ka and Kd from Equations 2 and 3. There are several instruments available from various companies based on the principle of SPR. Example of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). (A) In SPR, the reflected light is measured and is altered in response to binding of the analyte in the flow cell to the immobilized GBP. (B) An example of a sensorgram showing the binding of the analyte to (more...) A variety of chemistries are available for coupling ligand or receptor to the surface of the chip, including reaction with amines, thiols, or aldehydes and noncovalent biotin capture. In some approaches, a glycoprotein ligand for a GBP is immobilized and binding of the GBP is measured directly. It is also possible to degrade the immobilized glycoprotein ligand on the chip sequentially by passing over solutions containing exoglycosidases and reexamining at each step the binding to different GBPs, thereby obtaining structural information about the ligand. The immobilized ligand is usually quite stable and can be used repeatedly for hundreds of runs during a period of months.'
 'The glycans or glycan-containing materials are printed, much like DNA is printed for DNA microarrays, using contact printers or piezoelectric (noncontact) printing (Figure 29.6). Usually, a few nanoliters of solutions containing glycans in concentrations of 1–100 µm are deposited by a robotic printer on the glass surface in ∼100-µm-diameter spots. Slides are incubated for several hours to allow the chemical reactions to covalently fix the samples on the slides. The slides are then blocked to prevent nonspecific binding of reagents, and these microarrays overlaid with a buffer containing the GBP and incubated for several hours to allow equilibrium binding to occur. The slides are washed to remove unbound GBP and then analyzed. Analyses involve fluorescence detection, which means that either the GBP has to be directly fluorescent-labeled or a fluorescent-tagged antibody to the GBP must be used.

However, the clustered and relatively high amount of glycans densely packed that can bind detectable amounts of GBPs, may also promote binding of even relatively low affinity multivalent GBPs. Thus, the density of the ligand should be taken into account when interpreting the results. The type of linker used and the state of the monosaccharide at the reducing end (i.e., open ring, open or closed ring form attached to the linker) can also affect binding. Binding is visualized or imaged as intensely fluorescent spots against a dark background. The data are visually imaged on a scanner and then graphically represented. In a typical successful analysis a GBP may bind to several glycans that share structural features, often termed glycan-binding determinants or motifs. If desired, the GBP can then be tested for its binding to the identified candidates by other methods such as titration microcalorimetry or fluorescence polarization, to define the Kd as discussed above. The use of microarrays in characterizing GBPs is a central component of functional glycomics (Chapter 51). Publicly available glycan microarray binding data repositories are increasingly used in the field. A variation of glycan microarrays is a bead-based Luminex-type assay. In this high-throughput approach glycans are covalently immobilized on Luminex beads of different fluorophore properties. Thus, a multiplexed approach is taken where a GBP is mixed with a set of conjugated beads each identifiable by its fluorescent properties. The GBP may be biotinylated, allowing detection by fluorescent streptavidin, or the GBP may be detected by binding to specific antibody or another reagent if the GBP is epitope-tagged. The degree of binding of the GBP is a measure of its affinity and specificity for a particular glycan. The advantages of this approach is that it is high-throughput, allowing thousands of assays to be performed automatically, as well as utilizing small amounts of both glycan and GBP. The collection of data and its analysis are also automated. A limitation of the approach is that each glycan to be derivatized must be activated by having a primary amine or other chemistry for conjugation, and each conjugation of a glycan needs to be independently validated. Multivalent GBPs interacting with multivalent ligands, as expressed on cells, can cause the cells to agglutinate. This can be exploited by allowing one to measure the ability of a soluble glycan to block the agglutination activity of the GBP. The concentration of the soluble glycan that provides 50% inhibition of agglutination is taken as the inhibitory concentration (IC50). Such approaches have been used for many years in studies on lectin-induced agglutination of cells and were useful in elucidating the nature of the human blood group substances. If a sufficiently large panel of soluble glycans is used, then the relative efficacies of each of these can be measured to help define the specificity of the GBP. A major advantage of this technique is that it does not require tagging of the glycans.'

If a sufficiently large panel of soluble glycans is used, then the relative efficacies of each of these can be measured to help define the specificity of the GBP. A major advantage of this technique is that it does not require tagging of the glycans. Furthermore, polystyrene or dextran beads modified with discrete glycans can be used in lieu of cells. In this case, the glycans on the agglutinating particle are better defined. Usually, the IC50 does not relate directly to the binding affinity, because inhibition is being measured. The actual binding affinity must be defined by other techniques described earlier in this chapter. The interaction of a multivalent GBP or antibody with a multivalent ligand allows formation of cross-linked complexes in solution. In many cases, these complexes become insoluble and precipitate. Precipitation may be highly specific and reflects the affinity constant of the ligand for the receptor. To quantify this interaction a fixed amount of GBP or antibody is titrated against a glycoprotein or a glycan to which it binds and a precipitate will form at a precise ratio of ligand to receptor. The amount of protein or ligand in the precipitate can be measured directly by chemical means, using assays for glycans or proteins. The technique of precipitation is useful for studying potentially multivalent ligands, and it has been used recently to show that each branch of terminally galactosylated complex-type di-, tri-, and tetra-antennary N-glycans is independently recognized by galactose-binding lectins. Another precipitation approach takes advantage of the fact that a complex between a GBP and a glycan can be “salted out” or precipitated by ammonium sulfate. A variation of this approach was used in early studies on the characterization of the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR), in which the ligand 125I-labeled asialoorosomucoid was incubated with a preparation of receptor. The sample was treated with sufficient ammonium sulfate to precipitate the complex but not the unbound ligand. The precipitated complex was captured on a filter and the amount of ligand in the complex was determined by γ-counting. In this approach, a glycoprotein (or ligand) is mixed with a GBP or antibody and the mixture is electrophoretically separated in polyacrylamide. For glycosaminoglycans, this technique is termed affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE). This method is particularly useful in defining the apparent Kd of the interaction and allows identification of subpopulations of glycosaminoglycans that differentially interact with the GBP. In another method, termed crossed affinity immunoelectrophoresis, a second step of electrophoresis is conducted in the second perpendicular dimension across an agarose gel that contains precipitating monospecific antibody to the glycoprotein or ligand. The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested.'
 'In some approaches, a glycoprotein ligand for a GBP is immobilized and binding of the GBP is measured directly. It is also possible to degrade the immobilized glycoprotein ligand on the chip sequentially by passing over solutions containing exoglycosidases and reexamining at each step the binding to different GBPs, thereby obtaining structural information about the ligand. The immobilized ligand is usually quite stable and can be used repeatedly for hundreds of runs during a period of months. The advantages of this approach are that (1) affinities in the range from millimolar to picomolar can be measured; (2) complete measurements of kon and koff are routine (see Equations 2 and 3), making calculations of Kd straightforward; (3) for immobilization of a molecule using amine coupling, only 1–5 µg is normally sufficient; (4) typically, the concentration range of the analyte is 0.1–100×Kd and the typical volumes needed are in the range of 50–150 µL; and (5) measurements are extremely rapid and complete experimental results can be obtained within a few days. The drawbacks of this approach are that (1) analytes must have sufficient mass to cause a significant change in SPR on binding (thus, the glycan is usually immobilized instead of the protein); (2) coupling of free glycans to the chip surface may be inefficient, and thus neoglycoproteins or some other type of large conjugate may be needed; and (3) there may be inhomogeneity in conditions on the SPR instrument because of mass transport effects, which could affect the dissociation rate and thus provide an inaccurate Kd measurement. A related technology is biolayer interferometry (BLI), in which an optical biosensor analyzes the interference pattern of white light reflected from two surface. One surface carries the GBP immobilized in a biosensor tip, and the other surface is used as a reference. Binding of molecules to the biosensor tip changes the interference pattern in real time, thus allowing measurement of the kinetics of binding and dissociation. A clear advantage of this technique is that it does not require labels, such as fluorescent tags for detection (i.e., it is label-free). Additionally, BLI is generally performed in a 96- or 384-well format enabling it to be high-throughput. It is not quite as sensitive, however, as SPR, and thus small ligands, such as small oligosaccharides, may not provide robust signals. Like SPR, one of the interacting partners (e.g., the GBP) must be immobilized; with multiple tips it is difficult to ensure equal levels of immobilization. Nevertheless, this technique is easy to use and less costly compared to SPR, and when employed with the Cheng–Prusoff model in assays to determine oligosaccharide inhibition, BLI has been shown to generate solution Kd values that agree with those from NMR assays. Fluorescence polarization is an established technique but only relatively recently has it been applied to measure the binding constants of glycans to GBPs. This approach is based on the reduced rotational motion of a relatively small glycan when it is bound to a relatively large protein compared with the rotation of the free glycan in solution. Light absorbed by the fluorophore is emitted as fluorescence, but the angle of the emission relative to the incident light is depolarized by rotation of the molecule in solution, as measured through a filter to select molecules oriented close to the plane of incident polarized light. In practice, a fluorescently labeled glycan is incubated with increasing concentrations of a GBP and the fluorescence depolarization is measured. In the absence of the GBP, the fluorescently labeled glycan tumbles randomly and the degree of polarization is low. However, if the fluorescently labeled glycan binds to the GBP, its rate of rotation is diminished and the polarization remains high. By this approach, one can measure directly the Kd of the interaction as a function of the GBP concentration.']","The material bound to the bead-GBP may then be eluted for measurement and further analyses. Using this pull-down setup, one can perform a concentration-dependent binding assay to obtain an apparent Ka of the ligand for the immobilized GBP.","The material bound to the bead-GBP may then be eluted for measurement and further analyses. Using this pull-down setup, one can perform a concentration-dependent binding assay to obtain an apparent Ka of the ligand for the immobilized GBP. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is one of the most rigorous means of defining the equilibrium binding constant between a glycan and a GBP or indeed any protein and its ligand. The binding of a glycan to the GBP is measured as a change in enthalpy using a commercial microcalorimeter. In this technique, a solution containing a glycan of interest is added in increments into a solution containing a fixed concentration of GBP. The glycan is added at many intervals and the heat evolved from binding is measured relative to a reference cell. Over the course of the experiment, the concentration of glycan is increased in the mixing cell over a glycan-to-GBP molar ratio of 0–10. The heat absorbed or evolved during binding is determined and the data are replotted as kcal/mole of injectant versus the molar ratio (Figure 29.4).",0.75,0.6564582040162735,0.8156044915266678,0.007575757575757576,0.99999999998,1.0
"Complete the following paragraph: It is important to note that structural methodology is continually evolving, with additional information coming from techniques like small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Recent advances in cryo-EM provide many exciting opportunities to study protein–glycan interactions, which will also be discussed.","['If the geometry of the pocket is known, this allows elucidation of the orientation or polarity of the glycan in the binding pocket. The above provides a glimpse of NMR experiments that can be used to investigate protein–glycan interactions. There are many others that take advantage of additional properties such as differences in translational diffusion constants and specific interactions with water molecules. Many of these have been adopted as screening methods used in fragment based drug discovery programs. Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation.'
 'An initial structure for the minimal acceptor, Galβ1-4GlcNAc, was generated using the GLYCAM WebTool, but glycosidic bonds and hydroxyl groups were allowed to rotate during docking. Docking used the program AutoDock Vina. As in the previous example, an additional MD step in explicit water was used to refine the top ranked docked structure containing protein, donor, and acceptor. Interaction energies were then generated by applying MM/GBSA routines from Amber12 to 100-nsec MD production runs. Although the positions of donor and amino acid residues near the donor were modeled to be quite similar to those seen in other transferases, the docking/MD procedure provides a unique view of a possible acceptor position and its interactions. Most of the interaction energy holding the acceptor in place comes from interactions with the galactose ring, which is well-positioned to allow nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the nucleotide-activated Neu5Ac. This energy results from hydrophobic stacking of Tyr-366 with the nonpolar face of the pyranose ring and a network of hydrogen bonds between Asp-271, Asn-230, His-367, and Gln-232 of the protein and O2, O3, O4, and O6 hydroxyl groups of Gal. The position of the GlcNAc is more variable but does contribute to binding energy. The position and interactions among protein, donor, and acceptor are depicted in Figure 30.7.

J Biol Chem 288: 34680−34698.)  Structural biology is an evolving area of science both in terms of methodology and questions to be answered. The principle methodologies discussed here are each evolving: crystallographic methods using new X-ray sources (e.g., X-ray lasers) are allowing the analysis of microcrystals at room temperature and femtosecond timescales, thereby eliminating temperature- and beam-induced artifacts. Cryo-EM single-particle methods are approaching resolutions previously confined to X-ray crystallography. Single-particle and tomography EM approaches are continuing to undergo rapid development in terms of EM infrastructure, sample preparation, and data acquisition. Several user-friendly pipeline data processing packages exist, making this technology attractive to an increasing scientific audience. Hyperpolarization methods are reducing the sensitivity limitations of NMR, and solid-state NMR methods are allowing application to amorphous materials, including fibrils, cell-wall structures, and membrane fragments. Advances in computational technology are enabling simulation of ever larger systems and timescales. At the same time, structural targets are shifting from detailed characterization of single proteins and protein–glycan complexes to large-scale assemblies that cooperate to elicit a functional response. This is a promising situation for improved understanding of glycan function in biological systems. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Barbara Mulloy, Dillon Chen, and Sean Stowell.'

The biological effects that glycans elicit are frequently dependent on recognition of specific glycan features by the proteins with which they interact. In this chapter, some of the key structural features underlying glycan–protein interactions, as well as the primary experimental methods that have led to an understanding of these features, are discussed, specifically X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cryo-electron microscopy, and computational modeling. As emphasized in previous chapters, the numbers of distinct glycans produced by various organisms are enormous, but at the same time, glycans lack the diversity in functional groups displayed by other molecules. To achieve specificity in glycan recognition, proteins rely as much on the stereospecific placement of glycan hydroxyl groups at chiral centers, use of different linkage sites, and extensive branching as they rely on specific modifications of hydroxyl groups by processes such as sulfation, phosphorylation, and esterification. This puts placement of various residues and functional groups in three dimensions at a premium. Building a three-dimensional picture of how recognition of glycans by proteins occurs is therefore essential if we are to understand how glycans are synthesized and recognized in the many physiological and pathological processes they control. It is also essential if we are to use knowledge of glycan recognition as a basis for the production of therapeutic agents that can control these processes in the event of disease. Building a structure depicting glycan recognition is not without its challenges. Most glycans are highly dynamic in solution, sampling many conformations. Often, a single or a small subset of conformations is selected when a complex forms. This works against the formation of stable complexes for structural studies and the direct use of solution conformational data in defining conformations of bound glycans. The search for a structural basis of glycan recognition by proteins is not new. The concept of glycans fitting into pockets on protein surfaces dates back to Emil Fischer, who used the phrase “lock and key” to refer to enzymes that recognize specific glycan substrates. Lysozyme was the first “carbohydrate-binding protein” to be crystallized and have its three-dimensional structure determined. Subsequent work in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a structure complexed with a tetrasaccharide that confirmed the existence of specific interactions occurring between sugars and proteins, and the ability of proteins to select the appropriate “key” from numerous possibilities. Today, protein crystallography has reached a very high degree of sophistication and is responsible for the vast majority of the more than 170,000 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB); however, producing a structure with ligands in place is still challenging. The structures that exist tend to have ligands that are relatively small and interact with particularly high binding constants. Glycan recognition frequently involves contacts with multiple residues to achieve specificity. So, native glycan ligands are often larger than other types of ligands. Often, high avidity is achieved through multivalent interactions, in which case the affinity for an isolated ligand–protein interaction is small. Nevertheless, there are a significant number of crystal structures for glycan–protein complexes, and these have contributed greatly to our understanding of the types of interactions that make glycan recognition possible. Structural information on bound glycan ligands that is complementary to that from X-ray crystallography is increasingly coming from NMR methods. This is particularly valuable in that it is applicable to ligands with a broader range of affinities, including many that have the lower affinities amplified in multivalent interactions. It is also applicable in solution under near-physiological conditions in which concerns about the effects of crystal lattice contacts and occlusion of some interaction sites are absent. It is even possible to conduct some experiments on assemblies that mimic a membrane surface environment, an environment in which many protein–glycan interactions occur.'
 ""The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50. When protein–glycan interactions are of interest, the situation becomes more complex with hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and electrostatic interactions between glycan and various amino acids becoming important. For very limited sets of atoms, it is possible to pursue an understanding of interactions using advanced quantum mechanical (QM) methods, but for larger systems other approaches based on semiempirical “force fields” are used, as in molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Empirical “force fields” used in MM and MD modules of packages such as Amber, CHARMM, and GROMOS are typically represented in terms of bond, bond angle, torsion angle, van der Waals, and electrostatic contributions to a molecular energy. Parameters in functions representing each of these terms have been optimized to reproduce QM as well as a selection of thermodynamic and spectroscopic data. Initially, these force fields were developed for proteins alone, so they did not include contributions such as the anomeric and exo-anomeric effects found in glycans. Subsequently, force fields explicitly designed to represent the energetics of glycans have been developed for use with these packages (e.g., the GLYCAM force field that is widely used with Amber). There still are challenges in simulating molecular interactions with these packages, among them perfecting models for solvent and accurately representing electrostatic interactions. These issues are very important for glycans, which are rich in hydroxyl groups that act as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in their interactions with water. Some glycans (e.g., GAGs) are highly charged, having both carboxylate groups and sulfate groups that interact strongly with positively charged amino acids in proteins and with water. Although early simulations were performed with implicit solvent models based on dielectric behavior, recent improvements in computational capabilities have allowed use of explicit solvent models, such as TIP3P and TIP5P. MD, which uses the force fields directly in Newton's second law of motion, simulates movement of all atoms in addition to generating an ensemble of conformations and orientations that can be reached over times accessible to simulation (nsec to msec depending on the size of the system and efficiency of the computational platform). One advantage of MD is that certain important motional properties, such as the time for diffusion through a channel or the time needed for a conformational transition, can be modeled. One must remember, however, that force fields are meant to represent molecules near energy minima of a conformational surface and may not accurately represent the height of larger barriers separating different conformational states and certainly cannot represent changes in bonding that occur in a chemical reaction. The actual characterization of how a ligand (a glycan in our case) interacts with a protein involves not just the conformational energetics of the free glycan, but also the conformational energetics of amino acid residues involved in the binding site and the energetics of the glycan–protein interaction. In some cases, there may be relatively little information on where the binding site on a protein is, so the characterization involves locating the best binding site, finding the best conformation for the ligand in the bound state, and finding the best conformations for the parts of the protein involved in binding.""
 'Paper, textiles, cellophane, and rayon are other examples of everyday materials made from glycans. As our supply of petroleum runs out, glycans will increasingly be used to provide materials for the manufacture of plastics and a myriad of polymers (Chapter 59). Various forms of modified cellulose, for example, will be critical for the manufacturing of exotic materials and as carbon sources for various chemicals. Advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation and methods in recent years have been remarkable (Chapters 50 and 51). The ability to use mass spectrometry to map glycan attachment sites, to profile glycan structural variations, and to determine detailed fine structures of glycans has progressed rapidly because of technological advances in instrumentation, including electron capture and electron transfer dissociation fragmentation methods, and the development of ion traps with very high mass accuracy and sensitivity. In the future, ion-mobility separations in the gas phase will allow the identification of glycan isomers that have identical molecular masses in mixtures. In addition, there have been major advances in the chromatographic isolation and separation of complex glycans. New ultra-high-pressure pumps and very small particulate high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) resins that can withstand high pressures will also greatly increase the resolving power of chromatography. Advances in ion mobility and high-resolution mass spectrometric methods are, for the first time, allowing us to begin to decode the information content of glycosaminoglycans (Chapter 17). The development of induced hyperpolarization methods shows great promise in greatly increasing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of glycans (Chapter 50), which has been a major limitation in the analyses of biological samples. Recent advances in solution NMR spectroscopy that allows measurements of NOEs between OH groups have increased the number of distance restraints and improve the quality of glycan three-dimensional structures (Chapter 50). Bio-orthogonal labeling methods continue to be developed that will allow the study of changes in glycans in living cells in real time. Currently, for atomic structural analyses of glycoproteins, including X-ray crystallography, it is usually necessary to remove glycans to allow for crystallization. As electron imaging methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), continue to reach higher resolution approaching that achieved by crystallographic analyses, we will be able to obtain images of glycoconjugates at atomic resolution, without the need to remove the glycans. In fact, recent cryo-EM structures of the oligosaccharyltransferases have significantly impacted our molecular understanding of N-linked glycosylation. As NMR becomes more sensitive and can handle larger molecules, one will also be able to visualize glycoconjugates in physiologically relevant solvents and at appropriate temperatures. These developments will allow a much more accurate view of the 3D structures of glycoconjugates. Eventually, one will need to define the population of molecular species (glycoforms of glycoproteins and glycolipids) at an organismal and cellular level to fully understand structure/function relationships of glycoconjugates in response to extracellular stimuli. Existing technologies that show great promise include top-down glycoproteomics and high-throughput, high-resolution imaging methods. In the past few years, there have also been major advances in glycoproteomics. In contrast to glycomics, glycoproteomic approaches do not lose the context of where on a polypeptide glycans are attached (Chapter 51). In theory, if these methods live up to their promise, one day it may be possible to define the complete set of molecular species of glycoconjugates in a population and thus elucidate how they collectively contribute to the many individual functions of a gene product. However, all these methods still result in loss of information about labile modifications of glycans and also involve breaking apart the intact glycome into pieces before analysis. Ultimately, one will need to understand the actual structure of the intact glycome in situ in living systems. In parallel with advances in such sophisticated methods, it is also important to “democratize” the practical approach to glycobiology by developing simple methods that can be used by the average biologist working at the bench without sophisticated instrumentation. The NIH Common Fund has recently supported research designed to make the study of glycosciences more accessible to biologists and biochemists not in the field.']","It is important to note that structural methodology is continually evolving, with additional information coming from techniques like small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

"Complete the following paragraph: Ricinus communis is native to Africa and India and has been used for millennia, by many cultural groups, for numerous medical and industrial purposes. Two lectins, originally termed RCA-I and RCA-II, can be purified from the seeds.","['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health.

The R-type lectin superfamily is characterized by a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) originally reported in a polypeptide of ricin, a plant toxin. Ricin was the first lectin discovered, and the R-type lectins are named after it. Through evolution, the R-type lectin domain has given rise to various protein forms, some containing this domain alone and others containing additional functional domains (e.g., enzyme or toxin). We will discuss the diversity of this superfamily in terms of molecular tinkering and “bricolage,” based on structure–function relationships. In 1888, Peter Hermann Stillmark at the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu, Estonia) reported that protein extracts from seeds of Ricinus communis (commonly called “castor oil plant”; seeds are called “castor beans”) contained a factor (which he termed “ricin”) capable of agglutinating erythrocytes. Ricin was already well known as a toxin, but its carbohydrate-binding specificity was not analyzed in detail until the mid-20th century, when it was classified as a lectin. Structural analysis of ricin, performed around a century after its discovery, showed that the CRD had a “β-trefoil” (three-leaved) fold with a common Q-x-W motif in each subdomain. This domain structure defines the R(icin)-type lectins, a superfamily also classified as carbohydrate-binding molecule (CBM) 13 (http://www.cazy.org/CBM13.html) in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 6). These lectins are widely present in all three biological domains (and their viruses) as glycan-binding proteins, including enzymes and toxins (Figure 31.1). The R-type lectin superfamily. Different groups within the superfamily are characterized by the domain structures shown.  Ricinus communis is native to Africa and India and has been used for millennia, by many cultural groups, for numerous medical and industrial purposes. Two lectins, originally termed RCA-I and RCA-II, can be purified from the seeds. RCA-I (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) is a hemagglutinin and a very weak toxin. RCA-II (∼60 kDa), better known as ricin, is an agglutinin and a very potent toxin. Ricin is easily extractable from castor beans and can kill humans at very small doses. RCA-II (ricin; Figure 31.2) is synthesized as a single prepropolypeptide of 576 amino acid (aa) residues containing a secretion signal peptide (residues 1–35), an A chain (residues 36–302), a 12-aa linker region (residues 303–314), and a B chain (residues 315–576). The A-chain toxin is an N-glycoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.22) that inactivates the 60S ribosome. The B-chain lectin domain binds to galactose (Gal) and β-galactosides. The amino-terminal signal sequence brings the propolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal is cleaved off, and the polypeptide is glycosylated. The A chain is linked to the B chain by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 294 and 318 (Cys4 in the free B chain), and four intrachain disulfide bonds are formed. After glycosylation, ricin is transported to protein storage bodies in castor beans, where the mature ricin protein is generated by removal of the linker peptide by an endopeptidase.

RCA-I (agglutinin) is a tetramer consisting of two noncovalently associated ricin-like heterodimers. Each heterodimer contains an A chain disulfide-linked to a Gal-binding B chain. The A-chain sequences of RCA-I and RCA-II differ in 18 residues and are 93% similar, whereas the B-chain sequences differ in 41 of 262 residues and are 84% similar. The subunits are all N-glycosylated and usually display oligomannose-type N-glycans. Several other lectins having high homology with ricin are also encoded by the R. communis genome; some of these are termed ricin-A, -B, -C, -D (ricin), and -E. The B chain of both RCA-I (agglutinin) and RCA-II (ricin) contains two CRDs in the polypeptide. RCA-I binds preferentially to terminal β-linked Gal, whereas RCA-II binds to either terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc. These lectins are often purified and separated by differential elution from Gal-based affinity resins; RCA-II is eluted with GalNAc, and RCA-I is then eluted with Gal. These lectins have very low binding affinities for monosaccharides (Kd in the range 10−3 to 10−4 m), but very high affinities (10−7 to 10−8 m) for cells, because of their multivalency and enhanced binding to multiple surface glycans having nonreducing terminal Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (type-2 LacNAc) sequences. Both lectins also bind strongly to glycans with GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-R (LacdiNAc), and weakly to the isomer Galβ1-3GlcNAc-R (type-1 LacNAc). Neither lectin binds appreciably to glycoconjugates having nonreducing terminal α-linked Gal residues. Ricin is highly toxic and the effects of ingestion are severe, with symptoms appearing after a 2- to 24-h latent period. The lethal dose (LD50) of ricin is extremely low (3–5 µg/kg body weight). Ricin is classified as a type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP-II). RCA-I (agglutinin) is less toxic than ricin, because of the weaker enzymatic activity of its A-chain. Type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP-I), which lack a B chain with R-type lectin domains, are much less toxic than ricin because toxin entry into target cells is facilitated by B-chain carbohydrate-binding activity. RIP-I expressed in tissues of various types of plants affects disease resistance. Horizontal transmission of RIP-I gene to the genome of whitefly (Hemiptera, Insecta) feeding on such plants was recently demonstrated. Ricin bound to a β-linked cell-surface Gal/GalNAc containing glycans is transported into endosomes (Figure 31.3), and then migrates by retrograde trafficking to ER via the trans-Golgi network and Golgi apparatus. In the ER, A and B chains separate following reduction of the disulfide bond, perhaps catalyzed by the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase. A portion of the free A chain, which may be partially denatured in the ER, escapes by retrotranslocation through the Sec61 translocon and enters the cytoplasm.'
 ""Each subdomain could conceivably have a carbohydrate-binding site; however, in most R-type lectins only one or two subdomains bind a carbohydrate ligand. Carbohydrate-binding of RCA-I and RCA-II arises from aromatic amino acids stacking against Gal/GalNAc residues and from hydrogen bonding between aa's and hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate ligands. A wide variety of R-type lectins with diverse configurations, including RIP-IIs and heterotetramers such as RCA-II, have been purified from various plant tissues. Nontoxic lectins isolated from elderberry (genus Sambucus) bark include SSA (Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin) and SNA (Sambucus nigra agglutinin UniProt Q41358). These are useful because it is the rare R-type lectin that binds strongly to α2-6-linked sialic acid–modified glycans, but not to α2-3-linked sialylated ligands. Both are heterotetramers (∼140 kDa) composed of two heterodimers, each containing an A chain (resembling ricin A chain) disulfide-bonded to a B chain (R-type lectin). Expression of R-type lectins in roots and shoots of rice (Oryza sativa) was shown to be up-regulated in response to changing environmental conditions, based on genome informatics of Man and Gal-binding β-trefoil fold group EUL (UniProt B3SV73) found in Euonymus europaeus. Analysis of the promoter region of rice EUL genes revealed diverse stress-responsive elements. Analysis of expression profiles revealed that the genes were regulated in response to various types of stress (drought, osmotic, hormonal). Thus, β-trefoil fold lectins are involved in plant stress signaling and defense. Molecular structures of plant proteins having R-type lectin or β-trefoil fold domains vary extensively. Amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus) is an ancient South American crop plant with high nutritional value. Amaranthin (PDB 1JLX), purified from amaranth seeds, is a homodimeric lectin (Mr 66,000) consisting of two identical tandem-repeat β-trefoil fold domains. The primary structure of the lectin is ∼20% similar to that of ricin B-chain. Amaranthin specifically recognizes Thomsen–Fredenreich (TF or T antigen) (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) and sialyl-T (Siaα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) antigens. A GalNAc residue of the T-antigen disaccharide is captured by β- and γ-subdomains; thus, the mechanism of oligosaccharide binding by amaranthin differs from that of ricin B-chain and FGF (PDB 2AXM), in which a disaccharide is captured by a single subdomain. Phylogenetic survey of plant genomes revealed that many families have amaranthin-like R-type lectin domain sequences in their polypeptides. The sequences consist either of solely lectin domains (prototype R-type lectin), and include tandem repeats, or of a combination of lectin with various functional domains (chimera-type R-type lectin). Plants use R-type lectin domain by combining it with functional domains such as “aerolysin,” a pore-forming bacterial toxin. Tandem-repeat and chimera-type genes containing an amaranthin-like R-type lectin domain are expressed in many tissues and at different developmental stages, suggesting that R-type lectins respond to various external environmental stimuli. R-type lectins are present in fungi, protists, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Almost all of them have the same Q-x-W sequence and bind to Gal, GalNAc, and Man. Some are dimeric or oligomeric forms of simple β-trefoil subunits (prototype R-type lectin); others are tandem-repeat R-type lectins having two CRDs in the polypeptide chain. Chimeric forms have functional domains (enzymes, toxins) associated with R-type lectin, similar to those in plants and bacteria. Diverse forms of R-type lectins have been found in fungi (Chapter 23). Some consist solely of β-trefoil subunits.""
 ""In the ER, A and B chains separate following reduction of the disulfide bond, perhaps catalyzed by the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase. A portion of the free A chain, which may be partially denatured in the ER, escapes by retrotranslocation through the Sec61 translocon and enters the cytoplasm. Pathway of ricin uptake by cells and mechanism whereby toxic activity of A chain in cytoplasm results in cell death.  Just a few molecules of ricin A-chain in the cytoplasm are sufficient to kill cells. The catalytic subunit of A-chain is an rRNA N-glycosylase having eight α-helices and eight β-strands, which cleaves one purine base (adenine 4324) in the exposed GAGA tetraloop of the 28S RNA of the eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunit. This deletion results in loss of binding of elongation factor-2, inability of ribosomes to perform protein synthesis, and consequent cell death. Sequence analysis of RCA-I and RCA-II revealed that their B-chains contain two similar, characteristic regions in the polypeptide (i.e., the tandem-repeat R-type lectin). Each of the domains is approximately 120 aa long, with three tandem repeats of a 40-residue subdomain. Each subdomain contains a Q-x-W motif (x represents any aa). This tandem repeat is present in other toxins from plants of various phyla and is evidently characteristic of plant lectins. In the late 1990s, similar sequences were discovered in lectins from nonplant organisms, indicating that the ricin-B-like pattern is universal. In the early 2000s, these lectins were classified as the “R-type lectin superfamily,” and this superfamily is now categorized as a single domain (Pfam: PF14200) or tandem-repeat domain (Pfam: PF00652). Crystal structure analysis of ricin (Figure 31.2) indicated that B-chain (PDB 2AAI) has a barbell-like shape with the two tandem R-type CRDs at the ends, ∼35 Å apart. R-type lectins have a fold termed “β-trefoil fold” (from the Latin “trifolium” meaning “three-leaved,” as seen for example in clover) (Figure 31.4). The β-trefoil fold presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding the 40-residue subdomain. The three subdomains, termed α, β, and γ, each consist of 12 β-strands and loops arranged around a central axis, giving the protein internal pseudorotation symmetry. β-trefoil fold is maintained by the characteristic Q-x-W motif in each subdomain of ricin B-chain and common R-type lectins. More than 10% of lectins use this fold for glycan recognition (Chapter 30). Structures of β-trefoil folds of R-type lectin domains in various proteins. (Top) Structures derived from bacteria, fungi, and slime molds: AH (actinohivin in actinobacteria; PDB 4DEN), CNL (nematocidal lectin from conifer-loving mushroom Clitocybe (more...) In view of the conserved structures consisting of variable loops and a short β-barrel, in combination with low sequence homology based on β-strands connected by loops, the ability of β-trefoil proteins to flexibly select a variety of carbohydrate partners is not surprising. β-Trefoil proteins have been divided into several groups on the basis of biological function; these include lectins, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (PDB 2AXM; Chapter 38), interleukin-1 (PDB 1ILT), Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (PDB 4IHZ), and the actin cross-linking protein hisactophilin (PDB 1HCE), although they have no Q-x-W motif. Each subdomain could conceivably have a carbohydrate-binding site; however, in most R-type lectins only one or two subdomains bind a carbohydrate ligand. Carbohydrate-binding of RCA-I and RCA-II arises from aromatic amino acids stacking against Gal/GalNAc residues and from hydrogen bonding between aa's and hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate ligands.""

Rabinovich, and Avadhesha Surolia. The L-type lectins occur in the seeds of leguminous plants. They have structural motifs present in a variety of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) from other eukaryotic organisms. The structures of many of these lectins have been characterized, and many L-type lectins are used in a wide range of biomedical and analytical procedures and implicated in biomedical processes. This chapter discusses the structure–function relationships of these lectins and the various biological roles they have in different organisms. The L-type lectins have a rich history going back to the end of the 19th century when it was found that extracts from the seeds of leguminous plants (Fabaceae family but also called the Leguminosae family) could agglutinate red blood cells. These agglutinins (later named lectins) were found to be soluble proteins abundant in the seeds of leguminous plants. Different species of legumes were found to differ in hemagglutination specificity. Much work on these proteins was performed in the early part of the 20th century, including the crystallization of concanavalin A (ConA; the hemagglutinin [HA] from jack beans), which was first isolated by James Sumner in 1919 and crystallized in 1936 and was the first commercially available lectin. The legume lectins were also found to have hemagglutinating properties because of their ability to bind glycans on the cell surface. The abundance of these proteins in the soluble extracts of legume seeds (up to ∼5%–10% total protein) enabled many lectins to be isolated and characterized. Such seed lectins have considerable amino acid sequence homology, and the variety of carbohydrate-binding specificities found among these lectins made them useful tools in a wide variety of analytical and biomedical procedures. The crystal structures of a number of legume seed lectins allowed the identification of the carbohydrate-binding sites. Structural similarities in the tertiary structures were identified among these lectins and several other lectins, including the galectins (see Chapter 36), as will be discussed in this chapter. For this reason, the term “L-type lectins” has recently been designated as a classification for all proteins with this legume seed lectin-like protein structure. The L-type lectins are distinguished from other lectins primarily based on tertiary structure and not the primary structure. In general, either the entire lectin monomer or the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of the more complex lectins is composed of antiparallel β-sheets connected by short loops and β-bends, and they usually lack any α-helices. These sheets form a dome-like structure related to the “jelly-roll fold,” which is often called a “lectin fold.” The carbohydrate-binding site is generally localized toward the apex of this dome. The tertiary structure of the monomer of ConA, the lectin from the seeds of the legume Canavalia ensiformis, is shown in Figure 32.1. The crystal structures of at least 20 other legume L-type lectin monomers have been determined by high-resolution X-ray crystallography and are almost superimposable on this structure. Thus, it is not surprising that the amino acid sequences of legume lectins show remarkable homology with one another and of the sequences of many other legume seed lectins sequenced but not yet crystallized. Fewer, but significant, homologies in primary structure have been found between legume L-type lectins compared with some L-type lectins from far distant sources, such as ERGIC-53 and VIP36, found in vertebrates. Yet, in other L-type lectins, no homology is found with the seed lectins, although they contain similar lectin folds.']","RCA-I (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) is a hemagglutinin and a very weak toxin.

The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet. The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand. An exception to this case is found in two lectins (ConA and the closely related Dioclea grandiflora lectin) in which the glycine is replaced with an arginine. Both the glycine and arginine form hydrogen bonds with the ligand via their main-chain amides. Loop C contains an invariant asparagine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via its side chain, and an invariant hydrophobic amino acid. Besides these invariant amino acids, backbone atoms of the residues of loop D also contribute to monosaccharide recognition.

The bound sugar (lactose) is shown as a “ball-and-stick” model. Calcium and manganese ions are (more...) The legume L-type lectins are generally classified into groups based on their carbohydrate specificities as often identified by the ability of monosaccharides to inhibit their agglutinating activity. These differences in specificities are brought about by variability in the conformation and size of the D loop and to some extent by the C loop. Although the main specificity regions of the legume lectins are determined by the loops, there are sites other than these that contribute to lectin specificity. There are several additional modes of refining these specificities, such as interaction with water, posttranslational modifications, and state of oligomerization. Legume L-type lectins are oligomeric—mostly dimeric or tetrameric in nature—and adopt a variety of quaternary structures. The back β-sheet in the monomeric unit is involved in oligomerization. Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class. Interestingly, some legume lectins have a hydrophobic binding site that binds adenine and adenine-derived plant hormones with micromolar affinity; this is two to three orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for monosaccharides.'
 'Fewer, but significant, homologies in primary structure have been found between legume L-type lectins compared with some L-type lectins from far distant sources, such as ERGIC-53 and VIP36, found in vertebrates. Yet, in other L-type lectins, no homology is found with the seed lectins, although they contain similar lectin folds. For example, a comparison of the tertiary structure of the legume soybean lectin with the structure of human galectin-3 shows that both proteins contain the typical L-type lectin fold, but no amino acid sequence homology exists between the two lectins (Figure 32.2).

Both lectins display a related β-barrel (more...) Relationships between sequences of L-type lectins from legumes compared with the phylogeny of the various species within the Fabaceae family of plants suggest that these lectins most probably arose from divergent evolution. It remains an open possibility that the tertiary structures of some of the other members of the “L-type lectin family” arose by convergent evolution. It must also be noted that for a protein to be firmly placed in the L-type lectin category it must have the lectin fold and glycan-binding activity. All soluble L-type lectins found to date are multimeric proteins, although all do not have the same quaternary structure. Thus, these lectins are multivalent with more than one glycan-binding site per lectin molecule. The same multivalent principle applies to the membrane bound L-type lectins because the presence of two or more molecules on a membrane surface essentially presents a multivalent situation. In addition to increasing the avidity of the lectins for branched and/or cell-surface glycans, this multivalence can have great biological significance. Binding of the lectins to the cell surface can lead to aggregation of specific glycan receptors, promoting a variety of biological responses such as mitogenesis and various signal transduction processes. Plant L-type lectins are primarily found in the seeds of leguminous plants and are synthesized during seed development several weeks after flowering; they are transported to the vacuole where they become condensed into specialized vesicles called protein bodies. They are stable during desiccation of the seeds and can remain in that state indefinitely until the seeds germinate. They represent one of several classes of proteins stored in high concentrations in the seeds and are often called storage proteins. During seed germination, the storage bodies become the vacuoles of the cotyledons, which appear as the first leafy appendages of the plant. During the first week of development, these cotyledons provide food for the plant and eventually shrivel up and disappear. L-type lectins have also been found in the bark of some leguminous trees, and very low amounts of these lectins are also found in other vegetative tissues of legumes. In some cases, these latter lectins are encoded by separate but very similar genes. More than 100 of the seed legume L-type lectins have been characterized and are the most extensively studied proteins of this class. It also should be noted that the L-type fold has been observed in noncarbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectin-like receptor kinases in plants that are important in development and stress responses. A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B).'

 'The UniLectin3D classification of more than 500 distinct lectins results in 35 lectin domain folds, 109 classes, and 350 families sharing ∼20% and ∼70% sequence similarity, respectively. For each structure, links for coordinates, references, and taxonomy are provided, as well as glycan array data when available at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. Mining for structural data is therefore possible, and structures can be analyzed at different levels revealing not only atomic details of the binding sites but also protein folds and oligomeric states. Examples are given below that illustrate how convergent evolution has built robust systems for efficient recognition of glycans by lectins. The interactions between carbohydrates and amino acids include hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, ionic bonds, and a number of more specialized interactions. CH-π interactions, for example, are associated with the frequent occurrence of aromatic amino acids in carbohydrate-binding sites. Water molecules are often observed that bridge between carbohydrate hydroxyl groups and amino acids. Interestingly, a significant number of enzymes and lectins use divalent ions that directly coordinate to the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates and to side-chains of amino acids. Among the 350 different lectin families crystallized to date, more than 40 involve calcium ions in their binding sites. Most of them belong to the C-type lectin families (including selectins and DC-SIGN [dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin]), but other types of lectins from different origins are also found to have one calcium ion in their binding site (Figure 30.1). LecB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires the presence of two closely located calcium ions. Calcium ions contribute to the specificity of lectins by selecting for precise stereochemistries of hydroxyl groups; the two calcium ions of LecB, for example, only coordinate monosaccharides bearing the specific sequence of two equatorial and one axial hydroxyl group present in “fuco” and “manno” configurations. The ions also play a role in enhanced affinity through delocalization of charge as evaluated by quantum chemical calculations and through compensation for binding entropy losses by releasing strongly coordinated water molecules.

(A) Human MBP-A complexed with mannoside (1KWU), (B) Pseudomonas aeruginosa LecA complexed with galactose (1OKO), (C) sea cucumber (more...) Lectin structures adopt a limited number of folds (Figure 30.2). Among them, there is a strong predominance of β-sheet-containing domains, such as β-sandwich, β-prism, β-trefoil, or β-propeller. The β-sandwich fold, which is an assembly of two β-sheets, characterizes a large family with different structures that vary in size and localization of binding sites. For example, fimbrial adhesins are very different from galectins in that they use a site near the edge of a sheet as opposed to the concave surface of a sheet. Some structural convergence is nevertheless observed.

The polypeptide chains are represented as ribbons (more...) Convergence is also observed for the β-propeller fold, which is a circular arrangement of small β-sandwiches, called blades. Structures with five, six, or seven blades have been observed for lectins. With the exception of bacterial and fungal fucose-binding six-blade β-propellers, which are evolutionary related, these structures do not present sequence similarities. However, they share the same global shape allowing for the presentation of all binding sites on the same side of the “donut,” providing for very efficient multivalent binding to glycoconjugates on cell surfaces.'
 'Although the L-type lectin domain occurs in many proteins, in many cases evidence for carbohydrate binding and/or specificity is lacking. Examples include the L-type lectin receptor kinases (LecRKs) in plants, which is a large family of several thousand members comprising membrane receptors that are key to plant development, immunity, and adaptive responses to stimuli; and mammalian thrombospondins, a family of matricellular proteins implicated in angiogenesis and inflammation, including TSP-1, which has a carboxy-terminal domain that shows the typical β-sandwich of two curved antiparallel β-sheets, a feature of the jelly-roll topology, in which the L-type lectin domain is compactly assembled with three calcium-binding type 3 (T3) repeats The authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Yasuhiro Ozeki.']","The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet.

"Complete the following paragraph: The original experiments of Neufeld showed that a portion of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the medium, but may be recaptured by the same cell or by adjacent cells expressing cell-surface CI-MPRs (Figure 33.1). Enzymes that bind to such cell-surface MPRs are endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, eventually reaching the same late endosomal compartments in which newly synthesized molecules arrive from the Golgi.","['Although the cryo-EM structure at pH 7.4 is unable to visualize the N- (domains 1–3) and C- (domain 15) termini with sufficient resolution, it does provide insight into the arrangement of the entire extracellular region of the CI-MPR. The proposed cryo-EM model does not position the two M6P-binding domains (3 and 9) sufficiently close to bind a single, diphosphorylated N-glycan. This suggests that the high-affinity binding of this N-glycan is due to the spanning of binding sites located on different monomers of the CI-MPR. An alternative possibility is that the receptor is dynamic, with the spacing between the two M6P-binding sites being flexible, to enhance interactions with lysosomal enzymes containing phosphorylated glycans at various positions on their protein backbones. The dynamic nature of the receptor is supported by structural and biophysical studies which show that the conformation of the CI-MPR is affected by pH. The CI-MPR adopts a more compact structure under acidic conditions that may facilitate unloading of lysosomal enzymes in the acidic environment of endosomal compartments. Targeted disruption of the CD-MPR gene in mice is associated with normal or only slightly elevated levels of lysosomal enzymes in the circulation and an otherwise grossly normal phenotype. However, thymocytes or primary cultured fibroblasts from such mice show an increase in the amount of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes secreted into the medium. This indicates that mechanisms exist, which can compensate for the deficiency in vivo. Intravenous injection of inhibitors of other glycan-specific receptors capable of mediating endocytosis (e.g., the mannose receptor of macrophages and the asialoglycoprotein receptor of hepatocytes; see Chapter 34) gives rise to a marked increase in lysosomal enzymes in the serum of the deficient mice. Thus, such receptors are likely part of the compensatory mechanisms in vivo. Like fibroblasts that lack only CD-MPR, fibroblasts that lack only CI-MPR have a partial impairment in sorting. Fibroblasts from embryos that lack both receptors show a massive missorting of multiple lysosomal enzymes. Thus, both receptors are required for efficient intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes. Comparison of lysosomal enzymes secreted by the different cell types indicates that the two receptors may interact preferentially with different subgroups of enzymes. Thus, the structural heterogeneity of the M6P recognition marker within a single lysosomal enzyme and between different enzymes is one explanation for the evolution of two MPRs with complementary binding properties: that is, to provide an efficient but varied targeting of lysosomal proteins in different cell types or tissues. What initially appeared to be a precise lock-and-key mechanism turned out to be a far more complex and flexible system, with functionally useful biological flexibility. At steady state, MPRs are concentrated in the TGN and late endosomes, but they cycle constitutively between these organelles, early (sorting) endosomes, recycling endosomes, and the plasma membrane (Figure 33.5). MPRs avoid delivery to lysosomes, in which they would be degraded. This trafficking is governed by a number of short amino acid sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. The TGN is the site in which newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes bind to MPRs that are then collected into clathrin-coated pits and packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to the early endosome. This process involves interaction of the MPRs with two types of coat proteins: the GGAs (Golgi-localized, γ-ear–containing, ADP-ribosylation factor binding) and AP1 (adapter protein 1). In addition to binding MPRs, the coat proteins recruit clathrin for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles. Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases. Late endosomes then undergo dynamic fusion/fission with lysosomes, allowing selective transfer of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes and leaving the MPRs behind in subdomains of the late endosomes.'

Late endosomes then undergo dynamic fusion/fission with lysosomes, allowing selective transfer of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes and leaving the MPRs behind in subdomains of the late endosomes. These MPRs may then either return to the TGN mediated by a multiprotein retromer complex or move to the plasma membrane, in which internalization via clathrin-coated pits occurs, mediated by the coat protein AP2. There are several pathways for the MPRs to be returned to the TGN from the various endosomal compartments, although the relative importance of the different pathways is unclear. Subcellular trafficking pathways of glycoproteins, lysosomal enzymes, and M6P receptors (MPRs). Newly synthesized glycoproteins originating from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pass through the Golgi stacks and are then sorted to various destinations. (more...) The original experiments of Neufeld showed that a portion of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the medium, but may be recaptured by the same cell or by adjacent cells expressing cell-surface CI-MPRs (Figure 33.1). Enzymes that bind to such cell-surface MPRs are endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, eventually reaching the same late endosomal compartments in which newly synthesized molecules arrive from the Golgi. This secretion–recapture pathway is a minor one in most cells, but plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy. As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme. Some of these enzymes that are targeted to lysosomes via the M6P pathway have been prepared in large quantities as recombinant soluble proteins and used in enzyme replacement therapy. To date, the benefits have been variable but less than optimal. There are a number of potential reasons for this. First, some of the preparations may not contain the physiologic complement of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker. It is reasonable to suggest that a greater M6P content may improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement in these patients. This has been shown to be the case in mouse and dog model systems. However, even with fully phosphorylated enzymes there may be obstacles that are difficult to overcome. For example, some cell types in the body may not express adequate levels of the CI-MPR on their surfaces to endocytose sufficient enzyme to restore normal lysosomal function. Also, the organ that is most seriously affected in many of these diseases (the brain) is inaccessible because of the blood–brain barrier. Although the first intraventricular M6P-dependent enzyme replacement therapy for children deficient for the lysosomal tripeptidyl peptidase 1 are very promising, further studies are needed. Although the MPR pathway has a major role in vertebrate lysosomal enzyme trafficking, its contribution in invertebrate systems is not prominent. Lysosomal enzymes are targeted in organisms such as Saccharomyces, Trypanosoma, and Dictyostelium, without the aid of identifiable MPRs. The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum produces a novel methylphosphomannose structure on some of its lysosomal enzymes that can be recognized in vitro by the mammalian CI-MPR (not the CD-MPR). However, despite the presence of a GlcNAc-P-T that recognizes α1-2-linked mannose residues, the enzyme does not specifically recognize lysosomal enzymes, and no receptor for M6P has been found in this organism. Additionally, the Dictyostelium GlcNAc-P-T appears to differ from its mammalian hexameric counterpart because sequences related to the γ subunit have not been found in the Dictyostelium genome. The protozoan Acanthamoeba produces a GlcNAc-P-T that specifically recognizes lysosomal enzymes. However, this organism lacks a gene that could encode an “uncovering” enzyme, and so would not be expected to form M6P available to an MPR.'
 'NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.33 Nancy Dahms, Thomas Braulke, and Ajit Varki. Lysosomes are intracellular membrane-bound organelles that turn over and degrade many types of macromolecules, via the action of lysosomal enzymes (also called acid hydrolases because of the low-pH characteristic of lysosomes). These enzymes are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on membrane-bound ribosomes and traverse the ER–Golgi pathway along with other newly synthesized proteins. At the terminal Golgi compartment, they are segregated from other glycoproteins and selectively delivered to lysosomes. In most “higher” animal cells, this specialized trafficking is achieved primarily through the recognition of N-glycans containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) by “P-type” lectins. As the first clear-cut example of a biological role for glycans on mammalian glycoproteins and the first shown link between glycoprotein biosynthesis and human disease, the interesting history of its discovery is described in some detail. More recent data on other proteins with “P-type” lectin domains are also mentioned. Early studies of human genetic “storage disorders” by Elizabeth Neufeld indicated a failure to degrade cellular components, which therefore accumulated in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Soluble corrective factors from normal cells could reverse these defects when added to the culture media. These factors were later identified as lysosomal enzymes that were found to be deficient in patients with storage disorders. These enzymes, secreted in small quantities by normal cells in culture, or by cells from patients with a different “complementary” defect (Figure 33.1), existed in two forms: a “high-uptake” form, recognized by saturable, high-affinity receptors that could correct the defect in deficient cells, and an inactive “low-uptake” form that could not correct. Cross-correction of lysosomal enzyme deficiencies in cultured cells. Small amounts of high-uptake lysosomal enzymes secreted by normal fibroblasts (thin arrows) were taken up by fibroblasts from a patient with a genetic lack of a single lysosomal enzyme, (more...) Fibroblasts from patients with a rare genetic disease showing prominent inclusion bodies in cultured cells (therefore termed “I-cell” disease) were found to be deficient in almost all lysosomal enzymes. Interestingly, all these enzymes are actually synthesized by I-cells, but are mostly secreted into the medium, instead of being retained in lysosomes. Neufeld showed that although I-cells incorporated the high-uptake enzymes secreted by normal cells, enzymes secreted by I-cells were not taken up by other cells (Figure 33.1). She therefore proposed that I-cell disease results from a failure to add a common recognition marker to lysosomal enzymes. This marker was assumed to be responsible for the proper trafficking of newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes in normal cells. The “high-uptake” property was destroyed by strong periodate treatment, which oxidizes vicinal hydroxyl groups in glycans, predicting that the recognition marker was a glycan. High uptake of lysosomal enzymes was next found, by William Sly, to be blocked by M6P and its stereoisomer fructose 1-phosphate, but not by other sugar phosphates. Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis.'
 'But one should not necessarily assume that M6P-containing N-glycans on all of these proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking. Just as phosphorylation of serine residues has diverse biological roles, M6P might be used for more than one purpose in a complex multicellular organism. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoproteins have also been shown to carry N-glycans with M6P. In these cases, M6P is on complex N-glycans, suggesting that it originates from a distinct biosynthetic pathway. Regardless of its mode of synthesis, interaction of cell-free VZV with CI-MPR at the cell surface is required for viral entry into endosomes. Interestingly, intracellular CI-MPR can also divert newly synthesized enveloped VZV to late endosomes in which the virions are inactivated before exocytosis. This is suggested as the mechanism by which this successful pathogen limits immediate excessive spread and avoids killing the host or, possibly, a form of host defense. Biopsies of VZV-infected human skin showed that CI-MPR expression is lost in maturing superficial epidermal cells, preventing diversion of VZV to endosomes and allowing constitutive secretion of infectious VZV. These data implicate CI-MPR in the complex biology of VZV infection. Although the M6P recognition marker has a crucial role in trafficking newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to vertebrate lysosomes, alternate mechanisms exist in some cell types. In patients with I-cell disease some cells and tissues, such as the liver and circulating granulocytes, have essentially normal levels of enzymes. B-lymphoblast lines derived from these patients also do not show the complete phenotype of enzyme deficiency seen in fibroblasts. One possible explanation is that the M6P pathway for trafficking of lysosomal enzymes is a specialized form of targeting, superimposed on some other basic mechanisms that more primitive organisms use, some of which remain undefined. In this regard, two lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase ACP2 and β-glucocerebrosidase, are not at all affected in their distribution in I-cell disease fibroblasts. With ACP2, the enzyme is synthesized initially as a membrane-bound protein, and once in the lysosome, it is proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature soluble form. Glucocerebrosidase is targeted to lysosomes independently of the MPR pathway by forming a complex with LIMP-2, a lysosomal membrane protein that contains a targeting signal in its cytoplasmic tail. Likewise, other integral membrane proteins of the lysosome use similar targeting motifs in their cytoplasmic tails to traffic to the lysosome. Furthermore, several M6P-independent cargo receptors for the transport of lysosomal enzymes have been identified such as the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), LRP2 (megalin), sortilin, and mannose receptors. A small number of proteins have now been identified that are related to the P-type lectins because of the presence of MRH domains. These MRH domains contain the residues that bind mannose, but lack the residues that bind phosphate. In several instances, the proteins have been shown to bind to oligomannosyl structures. Most of these proteins reside in the ER where they function either as lectins (e.g., OS-9 and XTP3-B) or as glycosidases (e.g., glucosidase II) in the ER quality control pathway. Interestingly, the γ-subunit of GlcNAc-P-T has an MRH domain that plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of a subset of lysosomal enzymes. Similar to GlcNAc-P-T, it has been proposed that the MRH domain in the β-subunit of glucosidase II acts to optimally present the glycan to the catalytic α-subunit of this heterodimeric enzyme for efficient removal of glucose residues. The precise biologic role of these MRH domains remains to be elucidated. The authors appreciate the contributions of Stuart Kornfeld to the earlier edition and helpful comments and suggestions from Sneha Komath and Anne Imberty.'
 ""Sugars that lie too close to the lipid bilayer apparently give limited access to soluble lysosomal enzymes, and additional proteins called saposins are required to present the substrates to the enzymes. Saposins (SAPs), also called “liftases,” form complexes with multiple degradative enzymes for more efficient hydrolysis of short glycolipids close to the membrane. SAPs are derived from a 524-amino-acid precursor called prosaposin, which is processed into four homologous activator proteins each comprising ∼80 amino acids: saposins A, B, C, and D. Despite their homology, each saposin has different properties. SAP-A and SAP-C help β-galactosyl- and β-glucosylceramidase degradation, respectively. SAP-B assists arylsulfatase A, α-galactosidase, sialidase, and β-galactosidase. The activation mechanism of SAPs is thought to be similar to that of the GM2 activator described below. SAP-D and SAP-B also assist in sphingomyelin degradation by sphingomyelinase. Complete absence of prosaposin is lethal in humans, and deficiencies in SAP-B and SAP-C lead to defects that clinically resemble arylsulfatase A deficiency (metachromatic leukodystrophy) and Gaucher's disease. These symptoms might be predicted based on the enzymes that these saposins assist. GM2 activator protein forms a complex with either GM2 or GA2 and presents them to β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A for cleavage of β-GalNAc. The activator protein binds a molecule of glycolipid, forming a soluble complex, which can be cleaved by the hexosaminidase. The resulting product is then inserted back into the membrane, and the activator presents the next GM2 molecule, and so on. Genetic loss of this activator protein causes the accumulation of GM2 and GA2, resulting in the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. Endocytic vesicles deliver membrane components to the lysosome for degradation and are often seen as intralysosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs). They appear like vesicles within the lysosome and are especially prominent in patients with glycolipid storage disorders. How do “vesicles within vesicles” form and what is their function? The internal surface of the lysosomal membrane has a thick, degradation-resistant glycocalyx of integral and peripheral membrane proteins decorated with poly-N-acetyllactosamines, which protect the lysosomal membrane against destruction. However, these proteins would also shield incoming membranes from degradation if vesicle fusion simply occurred. By creating multiple internal membranes seen in typical MVBs, the target molecules are exposed to the soluble lysosomal enzymes, and digestion proceeds efficiently on the membrane surfaces of these internal vesicles. MVB formation starts with inward budding of the limiting endosomal membrane. Lipids and proteins are sorted to either the internal or the limiting membrane. Ubiquitination of cargo proteins targets them to internal vesicles of MVBs, but ubiquitin-independent routes also exist. Intra-endosomal membranes and limiting endosomal membrane have different lipid and protein compositions. Membrane segregation and lipid sorting prepare the internal membranes for lysosomal degradation. During maturation of the internal membranes, cholesterol is continually stripped away (to <1%) and a negatively charged lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) increases up to 45%. This molecule is highly resistant to phospholipases. BMP also stimulates sphingolipid degradation on the inner membranes of acidic compartments. Because BMP is not present in the lysosomal outer membrane, the unique lipid profile ensures that degradation by hydrolases and membrane-disrupting SAPs occurs without digesting the lysosomal outer membrane. Degradation of glycans is not always complete. Partially degraded or incomplete glycans on glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycosphingolipids can be internalized within a functional Golgi compartment containing sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases and then elongated. In the case of glycosphingolipids, this pathway makes a substantial contribution to total cellular synthesis, but in glycoproteins it probably makes a relatively small contribution.""]","This secretion-recapture pathway plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy, where lysosomal enzymes deficient in patients with storage disorders can be recaptured and taken up by cells expressing cell-surface CI-MPRs, facilitating their endocytosis and eventual delivery to late endosomal compartments for further processing and utilization.","This secretion–recapture pathway is a minor one in most cells, but plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy.

C-type lectins (CTLs) are Ca++-dependent glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that share primary and secondary structural homology in their carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). The CRD of CTLs is more generally defined as the CTL domain (CTLD), because not all proteins with this domain bind either glycans or Ca++. CTLs include collectins, selectins, endocytic receptors, and proteoglycans, some of which are secreted and others are transmembrane proteins. They often oligomerize, which increases their avidity for multivalent ligands and enhance recognition of pattern recognition receptor (PRRs). CTLs differ significantly in the types of ligands that they recognize with high affinity (e.g., glycans, proteins, lipids, and inorganic compounds). These proteins that recognize pathogens or self-expressed ligands function as adhesion, phagocytic, and signaling receptors in many pathways, including homeostasis and innate and adaptive immunity, and are crucial in inflammatory responses, leukocyte and platelet trafficking, and tissue remodeling. The CTL family is remarkably diverse and is the largest family of known GBPs. The first CTL identified in animals was the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), also termed the hepatic Gal/GalNAc receptor or Ashwell–Morell receptor (AMR). The sequences of the AMR and other CTLs revealed a CRD unique to this family of proteins. Glycan binding by CTLs is typically Ca++-dependent because of specific amino acid residues that coordinate Ca++ and bind the hydroxyl groups of sugars, but some CTLDs bind glycans without coordinating Ca++. The CTLD is defined by the sequence of amino acids and Cys positions, as well as the folded structure. Interestingly, comparisons of the folded structure of the CTLD to that in other proteins revealed a common folded structure, termed the CTL fold (CTLF), which is a structurally rigid scaffold that comprises a remarkable number of sequence variations, yet may have no sequence in common with CTLs, such as the major tropism determinant (Mtd), which is a receptor-binding protein of Bordetella bacteriophage. The evolutionarily ancient CTLF may occur in at least 1013 different sequences, a diversity that rivals the immunoglobulin fold in its conservation of structure using millions of different primary amino acid sequences. The CRD of CTLs is a compact region of 110–130 amino acid residues with a double-looped, two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet formed by the amino- and carboxy-terminal residues connected by two α-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Figure 34.1). The CRD has two conserved disulfide bonds and up to four sites for binding Ca++, with site occupancy depending on the lectin. Amino acid residues with carbonyl side chains are often coordinated to Ca++ in the CRD, and these residues directly bind to sugars when Ca++ is bound in site 2. A ternary complex may form between a sugar, the Ca++ ion in site 2, and amino acids within the CRD, whereas the specific residues within the CRD determine sugar specificity. Key conserved residues that bind sugars include the “EPN” motif (which promotes binding to Man, GlcNAc, Fuc, and Glc) and “WND” motif (which promotes binding to Gal and GalNAc), as seen in mouse L-selectin and rat mannose-binding protein C (Figure 34.1). However, because the CTLD is relatively shallow with few contacts to sugars, it is not possible to predict the glycan structures that bind to a particular CTL. In several CTLs, such as P-selectin and the AMR, Ca++ binding induces structural changes in the CRD that stabilize the double-loop region.'
 'However, because the CTLD is relatively shallow with few contacts to sugars, it is not possible to predict the glycan structures that bind to a particular CTL. In several CTLs, such as P-selectin and the AMR, Ca++ binding induces structural changes in the CRD that stabilize the double-loop region. Loss of Ca++ can lead to destabilization of these loops and loss of ligand binding, even when Ca++ is not directly involved in complexing the ligand, as seen in the macrophage mannose receptor. This destabilization is also important in pH-induced changes that lead to loss of ligand-binding affinity, because of the pH-induced loss of Ca++. In CTLD-containing proteins such as human tetranectin, which is not known to bind glycans, the CTLD can bind Ca++, but in the absence of Ca++ the CTLD is important for interactions with kringle-domain-containing proteins, such as plasminogen.

CTLDs have been categorized into 16 groups that are distinguished by their domain architecture. There are 86 proteins encoded in the human genome that contain a CTLD (mice have 123) (Figure 34.3). Most of these groups have a single CTLD, but the macrophage mannose receptor (group 6) is an example of a multi-CTLD protein and has eight of these domains. Several groups have CTLDs that lack critical Ca++ residues, but can bind glycans (e.g., dectin-1 and layilin in group 5); the REG group 7 lacks Ca++ binding but it is unclear whether they bind glycans, whereas tetranectin in group 9 binds Ca++ and again it is unclear if it binds glycans.

Interestingly, the viral proteins have more similarity to mammalian CTLD-containing proteins than the bacterial proteins. There are at least 278 genes encoding CTLDs within the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, but only a small number have the key amino acid residues required to form the primary Ca++ binding site.

 'Carboxy-terminal proteolysis of PC1 during its secretion releases a cytoplasmic portion that becomes nuclear and regulates cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, the CTLD of PC1 appears to bind collagen in a Ca++-dependent fashion that is inhibitable by sugars, including dextrans, but the precise nature of the interaction is still unclear. Some small proteins with CTLDs include Reg3α and PSP (pancreatic stone protein), which are in the REG group 7 of CTLs, and are essentially isolated CTLDs that are preceded by a signal sequence. Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'CRDs are typically independently folding segments of proteins; often one can separate the glycan-binding activity from other activities of the protein by expressing its CRD in isolation. In some cases, the CRDs constitute the entire GBP (Figure 28.2). Arrangements of carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) in lectins. Proteins containing just CRDs or CRDs associated with other types of functional domains, with membrane anchors or with oligomerization domains, are depicted schematically. A single lectin (more...) When a lectin is comprised simply of its CRD, its functions often are dependent on multivalency, which endows lectins with the ability to cross-link glycan-containing structures. This arrangement explains the ability of many plant lectins to agglutinate cells and to cluster glycoproteins on cell surfaces, which can induce mitogenesis as well as other signaling pathways. Other GBPs that function this way include the galectins, which can bridge glycans on one cell surface or between cells. Sometimes other activities are encoded within the structure of the same domain that binds glycans; some cytokines comprised of a single folded domain may have distinct sites for binding glycans and other target receptors. More commonly, other activities of lectins reside in separate modules in multidomain proteins (Figure 28.2). Such arrangements are widespread. The domains associated with CRDs perform many different functions, including binding other types of ligands, performing enzymatic reactions, anchoring proteins to membranes, and directing oligomerization. GBPs often contain multiple modules, combining several functions in one protein. Membrane anchors in lectins take multiple forms, but they often span the membrane, linking extracellular CRDs with cytoplasmic domains. This arrangement facilitates the flow of information between glycan-binding sites on the extracellular surface and the cytoplasm. Simple sequence motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane lectins often control trafficking of receptors and their bound glycan ligands. Common functions of such intracellular movements are internalization of cell-surface receptors, directing bound ligands to endosomes and lysosomes, and movement through intracellular compartments such as the ER and Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. Flow of information in the opposite direction can lead to stimulation of signaling complexes on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane in response to glycan binding at the cell surface. Clustering of glycan-binding sites (multivalency) is often critical to both recognition and biological functions and is achieved in different ways: by formation of simple oligomers of CRDs, as a result of the presence of multiple CRDs in a single receptor polypeptide, and through association of CRD-containing polypeptides via independent oligomerization domains. Some oligomers are stable, whereas others, such as those formed by some galectins, are in equilibrium with monomers. These arrangements facilitate multivalent binding to increase avidity and direct the geometrical arrangement of binding sites. Multiple CRDs may face in the same direction for surface recognition or in opposite directions to facilitate cross-linking. Multivalent CRDs may have fixed spacing or flexible spacing to accommodate different target glycans. In some cases, oligomerization domains also form structural features, serving as stalks that project CRDs from the cell surface. Oligomerization domains can also embody other functions, such as the protease-binding sites in the collagen-like domains of mannose-binding protein. It is convenient to classify lectins based on the structures of the CRDs that they contain (Figure 28.3). CRDs are found in a large number of different structural categories, indicating that many different protein folds can accommodate glycan binding (Chapter 30). Based on this observation, glycan recognition must have evolved independently many times and the diversity of CRD structures must have arisen to address a diversity of functions. Several major structural families of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) and their biological distributions. (CBM) carbohydrate-binding module; (EUL) Euonymus europaeus lectin; (ABA) Agaricus bisporus agglutinin; (EDEM) ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like (more...) GBPs appear across all domains of life, but the types of lectins in each kingdom vary considerably. Several families appear in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their distributions suggest different evolutionary histories.'
 'CLEC9A (DNGR-1) binds F-actin exposed by dying cells and regulates innate and adaptive immunity by tempering immunopathology associated with tissue damage; it also regulates adaptive immunity during acute tissue damage and by promoting phagosomal rupture and cross-presentation of internalized dead cell-associated antigens to CD8+ T cells. It is not yet clear whether recognition of the endogenous and exogenous ligands involves similar binding sites in the CTLD. CLR signaling of both PAMPs released following viral infections and DAMP from collateral injured cells may ensure microbial control while preserving integrity of the infected organs. The various signaling pathways by which many of these myeloid CTLDs function is illustrated in Figure 34.5. Most of these proteins express immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in their cytoplasmic domain. An example is dectin-1, which contains an activating ITAM-like motif, and like other activatory ITAM CTLs, also contains a tri-acidic motif that promotes downstream signaling. Some CTLs in myeloid cells, such as MICL (CLEC12A) and macrophage antigen h (MAH) (CLEC12B), contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). Such motifs on phosphorylation recruit tyrosine phosphatases to negatively regulate signaling pathways. Some CLRs, such as DC-SIGN, utilize alternative pathways (e.g., the serine/threonine kinase RAF-1). In fact, the same CLR can vary in function according to the ligand (physical nature, affinity, avidity) and thereby integrate distinct positive and negative signals, e.g., MINCLE and CLEC9A can trigger opposing signals through SYK or SHP-1. Signaling activity of C-type lectins (CTLs) in innate immune responses. CTLs expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages interact with different glycans, often expressed on pathogen-derived glycans. Activation of CTLs occurs through glycan binding, (more...) Among the myeloid CTLDs, CLEC-2 is expressed by NK cells, DCs, megakaryocytes, and platelets, but it is also expressed on some tumor cells. CLEC-2 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein whose signaling is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of a single tyrosine in the YXXL motif of its cytoplasmic domain. Signaling involves Src and Syk kinases and phospholipase Cγ2. CLEC-2 is also a receptor for the platelet-activating snake toxin rhodocytin, from the Malayan viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma. The major endogenous glycoprotein ligand for CLEC-2 is podoplanin (also called Aggrus), expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). CLEC-2 binds to the sialylated O-glycans and peptide portions of podoplanin. This is physiologically important and serves both as an alternative pathway for in vivo platelet activation, as well as fundamentally serving to drive lymphangiogenesis through the signaling functions of podoplanin. In the absence of extended O-glycans on podoplanin, as engineered in mice lacking C1GalT1 (T-synthase), due to loss of T-synthase or its chaperone Cosmc (C1GalT1C1), podoplanin is dysfunctional. This leads to defects in lymphangiogenesis, for lack of platelet involvement, a phenotype that closely phenocopies that seen in podoplanin-deficient mice. The CLEC-2-podoplanin pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cell motility and lymph node architecture and regulates inflammation notably during sepsis. Interestingly, different regions of the CTLD in CLEC-2 can bind the O-glycosylated podoplanin and the nonglycosylated rhodocytin. Another potential adhesion molecule is prolectin (CLEC17A), which is expressed in dividing B cells in germinal centers, and interacts with glycans containing terminal α-linked mannose or fucose residues.']","CTLs include collectins, selectins, endocytic receptors, and proteoglycans, some of which are secreted and others are transmembrane proteins. They often oligomerize, which increases their avidity for multivalent ligands and enhance recognition of pattern recognition receptor (PRRs). CTLs differ significantly in the types of ligands that they recognize with high affinity (e.g., glycans, proteins, lipids, and inorganic compounds). These proteins that recognize pathogens or self-expressed ligands function as adhesion, phagocytic, and signaling receptors in many pathways, including homeostasis and innate and adaptive immunity, and are crucial in inflammatory responses, leukocyte and platelet trafficking, and tissue remodeling.

"Complete the following paragraph: Of all the Siglecs, CD22 has the most conserved specificity for sialylated ligands, binding primarily to α2-6-linked Sias of the type Neu5Ac(or Neu5Gc)α2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc, which are common capping structures of many complex-type N-glycans. Additional specificity can be conferred by the nature of the Sia moiety as well as sulfation of the underlying glycan. Neither human nor mouse CD22 binds 9-O-acetylated Sias; mouse CD22 has a strong preference for Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac, whereas human CD22 binds both of the latter forms.","['CD22 has seven Ig-like domains and the intracellular region has six tyrosine-based signaling motifs, three of which could function as ITIMs. CD22 is a well-established negative regulator of B-cell activation, making an important contribution toward the threshold for signaling via the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex. Following BCR cross-linking, CD22 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated on its ITIMs by the protein tyrosine kinase Lyn. This leads to recruitment and activation of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase and subsequent inhibition of downstream signaling mediated via the BCR. Although some activating molecules are also recruited to the phosphorylated tyrosine motifs in CD22, the net phenotype of CD22-deficient mice is consistent with a primary role of CD22 in negative regulatory signaling, manifested by enhanced BCR-induced calcium signaling, enhanced B-cell turnover, reduced numbers of recirculating B cells in the bone marrow, and reduced numbers of marginal zone B cells. Of all the Siglecs, CD22 has the most conserved specificity for sialylated ligands, binding primarily to α2-6-linked Sias of the type Neu5Ac(or Neu5Gc)α2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc, which are common capping structures of many complex-type N-glycans. Additional specificity can be conferred by the nature of the Sia moiety as well as sulfation of the underlying glycan. Neither human nor mouse CD22 binds 9-O-acetylated Sias; mouse CD22 has a strong preference for Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac, whereas human CD22 binds both of the latter forms. Recombinant soluble CD22 can precipitate a subset of glycoproteins from B-cell lysates including CD45, a major sialoprotein of T and B cells. However, on B cells, CD22 appears to mainly be either cis-associated with other CD22 molecules in a glycan-dependent manner, or with the BCR, which it inhibits in a glycan-independent manner. These interactions are consistent with studies of mouse mutants that either lack CD22 glycan ligands or express mutated forms of CD22 unable to bind glycans. B cells from ST6Gal-I-deficient mice that lack CD22 ligands show an anergic phenotype, essentially the opposite of the phenotype observed in CD22-deficient mice. Mice expressing a lectin-inactive version of CD22 with a mutated binding site arginine also show reduced BCR signaling (anergy) and, similar to ST6Gal-I-deficient mice, they show increased CD22-BCR association and stronger CD22 phosphorylation (Figure 35.3). Likewise, Cmah-null mice deficient in Neu5Gc have reduced ligands for mouse CD22 and Siglec-G (see below) and show B cell hyperactivity. Proposed biological functions mediated by CD22. CD22 glycan-dependent homotypic interactions in equilibrium with CD22–BCR interactions. CD22 is clustered together by Sia-dependent homotypic interaction and kept away from BCR on wild-type B cells, (more...) Besides regulating B-cell functions via cis-interactions, CD22 can also mediate trans-interactions with sialylated ligands on other cells that sequester CD22 away from the BCR. This could be important for raising B-cell activation thresholds to “self”-antigens and may help to ensure that signaling through the BCR can only occur in lymphoid tissues in which CD22 α2-6-sialylated ligands are abundant. Although CD22-deficiency alone does not lead to extensive autoimmune reactions, mice deficient in both CD22 and the other major B-cell Siglec, Siglec-G, develop SLE-like symptoms, including production of IgG autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis. The restricted expression and properties of CD22 make it an attractive therapeutic target. Antibody-based CD22-targeting agents, such as antibody–drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin and recombinant antibody–toxin fusion protein moxetumomab pasudotox, have been approved for clinical use (for acute B-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, respectively).'
 'Structural basis of Siglec binding to ligands. X-ray crystal structures of the V-set domains of sialoadhesin (Sn) (A) and Siglec-7 (B) are shown complexed with sialic acid. (C,D) Molecular details of the interactions of sialic acid with Sn and Siglec-7. (more...) The cell-surface glycocalyx of most vertebrate cells is richly decorated in glycoconjugates that contain Sias (Chapter 15). The high local concentration of Sias is likely to greatly exceed the Kd value of each Siglec, resulting in self-binding to sialoglycans on the same membrane (cis) that can be directly functional or that can “mask” the Sia-binding site from interacting with sialoglycans on other cells (trans). Consequently, the Sia-dependent binding activity of most naturally expressed Siglecs is strongly enhanced following treatment of cells with sialidase to eliminate the cis-interacting sialylated glycans. A notable exception is Sn, which was discovered via its native property as a Sia-dependent cell-adhesion molecule on macrophages. The “masked” state of most Siglecs is a dynamic equilibrium with multiple cis ligands. Thus, an external probe, a cell surface or a pathogen bearing high-affinity ligands or very high densities of Sia residues, can effectively compete for binding to “masked” Siglecs. In addition, changes in expression of glycosyltransferases or sialidases of endogenous or exogenous origin could influence masking and unmasking of Siglecs at the cell surface, especially during immune and inflammatory responses. Siglecs show restricted patterns of expression in single or related cell types (see below). This is most striking for the conserved Siglecs—Sn (macrophage), CD22 (B lymphocyte), MAG (myelin-forming cell), and Siglec-15 (osteoclast). This theme extends to some of the CD33rSiglecs, most notably in humans, including Siglec-6 on placental trophoblasts, Siglec-7 on NK (natural killer) cells, and Siglec-11 and -16 on tissue macrophages, including brain microglia in humans. In the mouse, Siglec-H and CD33 are excellent markers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) and blood neutrophils, respectively, and Siglec-F is a useful marker of eosinophils and alveolar macrophages. These cell type–restricted expression patterns are thought to reflect discrete, cell-specific functions mediated by each of these Siglecs. However, certain key cells of the human immune system, such as monocytes and conventional DCs, express multiple CD33rSiglecs. Most Siglecs have one or more tyrosine-based signaling motifs in their cytoplasmic tails or associate with membrane adaptor proteins containing cytosolic tyrosine motifs. The most prevalent motif is the ITIM with the consensus sequence (V/I/L)XYXX(L/V), where X is any amino acid. Up to 300 ITIM-containing membrane proteins are identified in the human genome, and many of these are established inhibitory receptors of the hematopoietic and immune systems. Following tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, they function by recruiting and activating SH2-domain-containing effectors, especially the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. These counteract activating signals triggered by receptors containing ITAMs. Some Siglecs, notably Siglecs-14, -15, -16, and -H and mouse CD33, have a positively charged residue within the transmembrane region, which can associate with the DAP12 ITAM-containing adaptor, thereby mediating activating functions. Sn (CD169) was identified as a Sia-dependent sheep erythrocyte receptor expressed by mouse stromal macrophages. Sn has an unusually large number of Ig domains (seventeen), which are conserved among mammals and reptiles. These may be important for extending the Sia-binding site away from the plasma membrane to promote intercellular interactions.'
 'ICAM-1 plays crucial roles in cell–cell interactions, extravasation, inflammation, and host defense. Hemolin is an IgSF plasma protein from lepidopteran insects that binds lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria. Hemolin appears to have two binding sites for LPS—one that interacts with the phosphate groups of lipid A and another that interacts with the O-specific glycan antigen and the outer-core glycans of LPS. There is indirect and less convincing evidence for interactions of other IgSF molecules with glycans, such as the peripheral myelin protein P0 with HNK-1, CD83 with Sias, and CD2 with Lewis x (Lex). Overall, with the exception of the Siglecs and the PILRs, the direct assignment of an IgSF fold as the actual binding pocket for glycans has not been achieved. The rest of this chapter is devoted to Siglecs, the best-characterized I-type lectins. All Siglecs are type-1 membrane proteins with a Sia-binding, amino-terminal V-set domain and varying numbers of C-set Ig domains that act as spacers, projecting the Sia-binding site away from the plasma membrane. The V-set domain and the adjacent C-set domain contain a small number of invariant amino acid residues, including an “essential” arginine on the F β-strand required for Sia binding, and an unusual organization of cysteine residues. Instead of the typical intersheet disulfide bond between the B and F β-strands, the V-set domain of Siglecs displays an intrasheet disulfide bond between the B and E β-strands, permitting increased separation between the β-sheets. The resulting exposure of hydrophobic residues allows specific interactions with constituents of Sia ligands. All Siglecs studied so far also appear to contain an additional unusual disulfide bond between the V-set domain and the adjacent C-set domain, which would be expected to promote tight packing at the interface between the first two Ig domains. Although the significance of this bond for ligand recognition is unclear, optimal Sia-binding activity of many Siglecs requires the adjacent C-set domain, probably for correct folding and stability. Three-dimensional structures for the mouse Sn, human Siglec-7, and human CD33 V-set domains, the V-set and adjacent C-set domain of Siglec-5, first three Ig-like domains of human CD22, and all five Ig-like domains of mouse MAG have been determined by X-ray crystallography, in the presence and absence of Sia ligands (Figure 35.2). Along with the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of Siglec-8, structural templates for Sia recognition by Siglecs appear to be shared among Siglecs. In all instances, an “essential” arginine residue is located in the middle of the F β-strand, making a bidentate salt bridge with the carboxylate of Sia. Siglecs also contain conserved hydrophobic amino acids on the A and G β-strands that interact with the N-acetyl group and glycerol side chain of Sia, respectively. Although all Siglecs appear to use a common template for recognizing Sias, their binding preferences for extended glycan chains vary greatly. The peptide loop between the C and C′ β-strands is highly variable among Siglecs and has a key role in determining their fine sugar specificity. For example, molecular grafting of the C–C′ loop between Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 resulted in switched sugar-binding specificities. Structural studies have shown that this loop appears to be highly flexible, being able to make specific and varied interactions with long glycan chains. In addition, V-set domain sequences are the most rapidly evolving regions in these molecules, likely explaining species differences in binding specificity.

 'The extracellular regions of these proteins are >99% identical because of gene conversion events. Siglec-11 and Siglec-16 bind weakly to α2-8-linked Sias in vitro. These Siglecs appear to be absent from circulating leukocytes, but are expressed widely on populations of tissue macrophages, including resident microglia in the brain, where high levels of α2-8-linked Sias are present on gangliosides. Expression of Siglec-11 on microglia can impair their phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, yet alleviates neurotoxicity by suppressing neuroinflammation. Interestingly, microglial expression of Siglec-11 appears unique to humans. Siglec-16 is also present on microglia. These paired receptors exhibit dualistic responses to Escherichia coli K1, which expresses polysialic acid ligands. The ancestral condition of some hominid Siglecs (e.g., Siglec-11) appears to have been preferential binding to Neu5Gc, a Sia specifically lost in human evolution ∼2–3 million years ago (Chapter 15). This loss could have resulted in some Siglec unmasking, possibly leading to a state of heightened innate immune reactivity. Some human Siglecs have undergone an adjustment to allow increased Neu5Ac binding, and the question arises whether the adjustment is yet complete. Possibly, as a consequence of Neu5Gc loss, several Siglecs seem to have undergone human-specific changes in comparison to our great ape evolutionary cousins. For example, Sn is expressed on most human macrophages, whereas only subsets of chimpanzee macrophages are positive. This may be related to the fact that Sn has a strong binding preference for Neu5Ac rather than Neu5Gc, which is not synthesized by humans. Human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 appear to have undergone a restoration of the “essential” arginine residue needed for Sia recognition, which is mutated in chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Siglec-7 is selectively expressed in human pancreatic islets. The gene encoding Siglec-11 has undergone a human-specific gene conversion, resulting in a new protein expression in brain microglia along with its paired receptor, Siglec-16. Siglec-12 has suffered a human-specific and human universal inactivation of the “essential” arginine residue with subsequent permanent pseudogenization by a frameshift in some humans. Siglec-13 underwent a human-specific gene deletion and Siglec-17 has a frameshift mutation, events possibly occurring close to the time of the common ancestor of modern humans. Expression patterns of some Siglecs have also undergone changes, with placental expression of Siglec-6 and amniotic epithelium expression of Siglec-5/14 being human-specific, and a general suppression of all CD33rSiglecs on human T cells compared with the chimpanzee. The functional implications of these human-specific changes in Siglec biology for physiology and disease are under exploration and may be related to human propensities for certain diseases (Chapter 15). Although CD33rSiglecs can modulate innate immune cell responses via recognition of endogenous sialoglycans as “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), many pathogens take advantage of this property by generating sialylated molecular mimics on their surfaces, using a variety of biochemical mechanisms. The naturally occurring “essential” arginine mutations mentioned above appear to be one way that the host can evade this subversion. However, pathogens in turn have evolved mechanisms to directly engage CD33rSiglecs via protein–protein interactions—for example, the β-protein of Type-Ia GBS engages human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 independent of Sias. Early evidence indicates that more such examples exist, as well as alternate endogenous nonsialylated ligands within the host, such as the heat-shock protein HSP-70, cardiolipin, and another self-glycan, hyaluronan. As with many other classes of receptors whose original discovery was based on one canonical function, it is likely that evolutionary forces have generated many other functions for Siglecs, independent of their ability to recognize sialoglycans. The authors appreciate contributions of Paul Crocker to the earlier editions and helpful comments and suggestions from Pamela Stanley and Susan L. Bellis.'
 'The restricted expression and properties of CD22 make it an attractive therapeutic target. Antibody-based CD22-targeting agents, such as antibody–drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin and recombinant antibody–toxin fusion protein moxetumomab pasudotox, have been approved for clinical use (for acute B-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, respectively). MAG, a minor constituent of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin, has five Ig-like domains and is well conserved among vertebrates. It is expressed by myelin-forming cells: oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS. In mature myelinated axons it is found primarily on the innermost (periaxonal) myelin wrap, directly across from the axon, but not in the multilayers of compacted myelin. MAG-deficient mice develop normal myelin, but defects in myelin and axons increase as animals age, indicating a role for MAG in the maintenance of myelinated axons, rather than in the process of myelination. MAG-null mice display late-onset axonal degeneration leading to progressive loss of motor function. MAG-null mice fail to show characteristic myelin-induced increases in neurofilament phosphorylation and therefore reduced axon diameters, indicating that MAG signaling is required for optimal myelin–axon interactions. Mendelian disorders (autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 75) caused by homozygous mutation in the MAG gene, including a point mutation in its Sia-binding arginine, have been reported, and clinical features of the disease are consistent with the roles of MAG revealed by the studies of Mag-deficient mice. MAG also directly inhibits neurite outgrowth from a wide variety of neuronal cell types in vitro. This contributes to the inhibitory activity of myelin on axon outgrowth after nervous system injury, hampering functional recovery. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that gangliosides (sialylated glycolipids) are important physiological ligands for MAG, mediating both myelin–axon stability and inhibition of axon outgrowth. Recombinant forms of MAG bind selectively to the abundant axonal gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (Chapter 11). The phenotype of MAG-deficient mice is similar to that of mice lacking an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (coded by the B4galnt1 gene) required for synthesis of GD1a and GT1b, resulting in progressive motor dysfunction. Notably, human mutations in the same gene (B4GALNT1) result in hereditary spastic paraplegia, a progressive motor neuropathy reminiscent of that of B4galnt1-null mice. Binding of soluble MAG to some types of neurons, and subsequent MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth, is Sia and ganglioside dependent. MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth from B4galnt1-null mouse neurons is diminished, whereas MAG still inhibits neurite outgrowth from the neurons of mice lacking the “b-series” gangliosides (GD3 synthase-null; Chapter 11), which lack GT1b but express GD1a. These findings suggest that gangliosides GD1a or GT1b act as functional docking sites for MAG on neuronal cells. MAG binds to other axonal receptors including a family of GPI-anchored proteins (Nogo receptors NgR1 and NgR2) and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB). Gangliosides, NgRs, and PirB may act independently or interactively as MAG receptors, linking MAG binding to axonal signaling in different neuronal cell types. Siglec-15 was first described as a highly conserved ancient Siglec in vertebrates. It lacks the typical arrangement of cysteines seen in the V-set Ig domain of other Siglecs and has an unusual intron–exon arrangement. Nevertheless, it can bind the Sialyl-Tn structure (Neu5Acα2-6GalNAcα) and other structures containing a Neu5Acα2-6HexNAc determinant. It associates with DAP12 but also has an ITIM-like motif in its cytoplasmic tail.']","CD22, among all the Siglecs, exhibits the highest degree of conservation in its specificity for sialylated ligands. It predominantly binds to α2-6-linked Sias, specifically recognizing the Neu5Ac(or Neu5Gc)α2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc structure commonly found as capping structures on various complex-type N-glycans. The specificity of CD22 can be further influenced by the specific nature of the Sia moiety and the sulfation status of the underlying glycan. Notably, neither human nor mouse CD22 interacts with 9-O-acetylated Sias. In terms of preference for Neu5Gc versus Neu5Ac, mouse CD22 strongly favors Neu5Gc, while human CD22 can bind to both Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac forms.","Recombinant soluble CD22 can precipitate a subset of glycoproteins from B-cell lysates including CD45, a major sialoprotein of T and B cells. However, on B cells, CD22 appears to mainly be either cis-associated with other CD22 molecules in a glycan-dependent manner, or with the BCR, which it inhibits in a glycan-independent manner.

"Complete the following paragraph: Following the discovery of the Ashwell–Morell asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR) in the liver, many investigators sought other such receptors by affinity chromatography with immobilized asialoglycoproteins. In 1975, a novel lectin of ∼15 kDa was isolated from electric organs of the electric eel, and named “electrolectin.” This noncovalently linked homodimer displayed hemagglutinating activity toward trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes that was inhibitable by β-galactosides; inclusion of β-mercaptoethanol in the isolation buffers was required to maintain the binding activity.","['Interestingly, the viral proteins have more similarity to mammalian CTLD-containing proteins than the bacterial proteins. There are at least 278 genes encoding CTLDs within the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, but only a small number have the key amino acid residues required to form the primary Ca++ binding site. The AMR is expressed primarily on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes and was discovered serendipitously during studies on clearance of the serum glycoprotein ceruloplasmin, a major copper carrier in mammalian plasma. Glycosylation of ceruloplasmin was found to regulate its lifetime in the rabbit circulation; enzymatic desialylation of radiolabeled ceruloplasmin exposed penultimate β-linked Gal residues and caused rapid accumulation of asialoceruloplasmin into hepatocytes. Removal or modification of the exposed Gal residues lessened the rate of clearance. In 1974, the Ca++-dependent AMR was purified from rabbit liver by affinity chromatography on asialoorosomucoid-Sepharose. The rabbit AMR is a heterooligomer containing two subunits of 48 kDa and 40 kDa, whereas the human AMR contains two subunits of 50 kDa (H1) and 46 kDa (H2) that occur as a heterooligomeric type I transmembrane protein (trimers and high-order oligomers) comprised of small and large subunits. The purified rabbit AMR agglutinated desialylated human and rabbit erythrocytes and induced mitogenesis in desialylated peripheral lymphocytes, which represented the first demonstration that an animal GBP could profoundly affect cellular metabolism. Interestingly, hepatic AMR can also recognize some sialylated ligands (Siaα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R). A homologous GBP identified in chicken hepatocytes recognizes glycoproteins containing terminal GlcNAc, rather than Gal, residues. Interestingly, circulating glycoproteins in birds constitutively lack sialic acid (Sia) compared with their mammalian counterparts. The AMR was one of the first proteins shown to participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) and, along with the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, transferrin receptor, and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), represents some of the best characterized receptors. The AMR internalizes its ligands captured at the cell surface at physiological pH; via coated pits, the AMR in complex with its ligand is internalized into coated vesicles (Figure 34.4), and changes in pH in late endosomes lead to dissociation of Ca++ from the AMR and release of ligand. The uncomplexed AMR then recycles to the plasma membrane, whereas the ligand is delivered to lysosomes where it is degraded. For some nonrecycling receptors (e.g., dendritic cell [DC]-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin [DC-SIGN]), both the ligand and receptor are targeted to lysosomes and degraded. Internalization of ligands by the AMR in hepatocytes is rapid, occurring in 2–3 minutes, and the receptor recycles to the surface within 4–5 minutes. The efficiency of the AMR in endocytosis has led it to be a target for gene therapy and delivery of molecules to hepatocytes. Some C-type lectins (CTLs) are endocytic receptors. Ligands are internalized by clathrin-dependent pathways and delivered to early and then late endosomes. Receptors may be recycled or degraded, depending on the receptor and the type of ligand it endocytoses. (more...) The precise orientation of the trimers within the AMR can dictate its affinity to specific glycans that have multivalent presentations. The AMR binds glycans with terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc residues; however, tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans, with appropriate branching and presentation of nonreducing terminal Gal/GalNAc, bind to the rat AMR with >100,000× higher affinity (∼nm range) than ligands with a single terminal Gal/GalNAc residue. Surprisingly, mice null for the AMR were found to be phenotypically normal without challenge.'
 'Lectins and antibodies are useful for characterizing cell-surface glycans when limited numbers of cells are available. Studies on glycosylation of embryonic stem cells have been greatly aided by using panels of specific lectins to identify unique glycan determinants and changes in their expression during cellular differentiation. A recent variation of this approach is to use a microarray of immobilized lectins, which are probed with fluorescently labeled glycoproteins in extracts of cells. Such assays can reveal minor differences in protein glycosylation between different samples and give insight into the glycan structures that are present. One of the oldest uses of lectins is in the agglutination and precipitation of glycoconjugates, cells, and membrane vesicle preparations. The easiest assay for many soluble lectins that are multivalent is agglutination of target cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, or even bacteria or fungi. Agglutination can often be easily observed without a microscope, but it is also measurable in instruments such as aggregometers. In these assays, a lectin solution is serially diluted and the reciprocal of the final dilution that gives measurable cell agglutination is taken to define the activity. Bacterial agglutination by plant and animal lectins is often used to explore the surface glycocalyx and changes in glycocalyx on culture conditions and to define phenotypes of different strains or serotypes. Lectin precipitation and aggregation can be used to define the glycan composition and overall architecture of polysaccharides, as has been done for bacterial, algal, plant, and animal polysaccharides. Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. Fluorescent-tagged glycoproteins from a source (e.g., cell or tissue extracts) can be applied to these arrays and the binding pattern compared to a control sample can reveal features of the glycome of the material, such as patterns of sialylation, fucosylation, and even linkages of residues with glycans using linkage-specific reagents. The advantages of this approach is the microscale in which it can be performed, the relatively high-throughput nature of the technology, and the precision of discrimination in terms of differential glycosylation between two samples. The system is particularly adaptable to include new reagents as they become available (e.g., new lectins or engineered proteins). An important use of lectins and antibodies has been in the selection of cell lines (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] cells) that express altered cell-surface glycans. The common lectins that have been used are ConA, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin), L-PHA, LCA, PSA (Pisum sativum agglutinin), E-PHA, ricin, modeccin, and abrin. The latter three lectins are heterodimeric, disulfide-bonded proteins that are classified as type-II ribosome-inactivating proteins; they contain an A subunit that constitutes an enzyme called RNA-N-glycosidase, which inactivates the 28S ribosome, and a B subunit that is a galactose-binding lectin (Chapter 31). Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture. One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained.'
 'The AMR binds glycans with terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc residues; however, tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans, with appropriate branching and presentation of nonreducing terminal Gal/GalNAc, bind to the rat AMR with >100,000× higher affinity (∼nm range) than ligands with a single terminal Gal/GalNAc residue. Surprisingly, mice null for the AMR were found to be phenotypically normal without challenge. However, it is now known that the AMR is required to clear platelets (thrombocytes) during Streptococcus pneumoniae–related sepsis, which is accompanied by microbial-dependent desialylation of platelets and consequent thrombocytopenia. Clearance helps to limit disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) caused by the infection. Such clearance of platelets during sepsis or as a result of platelet aging is also linked to production of thrombopoietin that regulates platelet production. Many other CTLs, both type I and type II transmembrane proteins, also deliver bound ligands to lysosomes via RME through their cytoplasmic motifs (Figure 34.4). Endocytosis of ligands by CTLs in DCs and macrophages can lead to receptor accumulation and degradation in phagolysosomes or to recycling of the receptor to the cell surface. The pathway taken is dependent on the bound ligand. Dectin-1 is degraded when it internalizes zymosan, but it is recycled when it endocytoses soluble ligands. Stimulation of CTLs such as dectin-1 in myeloid cells activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and enhances transcription of genes important in innate immune responses. Internalization of antigens via the CTLs in DCs induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other responses. CLEC9A (DNGR-1) and the mannose receptor divert cargo away from lysosomal compartments to allow retrieval of antigens for cross-presentation. Clustering and density of the CTLDs may determine both their specificity and their affinity for ligands because each individual CRD can act independently to bind sugar. Although the hepatic lectins subunits have a single CTLD, the macrophage mannose receptor has eight CTLDs in a single polypeptide. The adjacent CTLDs may promote binding to specific multivalent, mannose-containing glycans. The macrophage mannose receptor internalizes lysosomal enzymes containing oligomannose-type N-glycans and facilitates phagocytosis of several pathogens such as yeast, Pneumocystis carinii, and Leishmania. Interestingly, domains in some CTLs outside of the CTLD may also have receptor activity. For example, the cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor is an R-type domain (Chapter 31) that binds to glycans containing R-GalNAc-4-SO4 on pituitary glycoprotein hormones and thus acts to clear these hormones from the circulation. The collectins are a family of soluble and membrane-bound CTLs that contain a collagen-like domain amino-terminal to the CTLD and usually assemble in large oligomeric complexes containing 9–27 subunits (Figure 34.3). Bovine conglutinin was identified in the early 1900s by Bordet and Streng as a plasma protein that agglutinated erythrocytes following reactions with antibody and complement, now known to be through Ca++-dependent interactions with the exposed glycans on iC3b after proteolytic conversion from C3b. Bovine conglutinin and human conglutinin bind yeast glycans, and GlcNAc can inhibit interactions. The term conglutinin was coined in 1993 based on evidence that conglutinin had a collagen-like sequence and exhibited lectin activity. To date, nine different collectins have been identified: conglutinin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D (which were originally found in the lung but also expressed in the intestine), and collectins CL-43, CL-46, CL-P1, CL-L1, and CL-K1.'

Etzler, and Ajit Varki. This chapter provides an overview of naturally occurring glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), the history of their discovery, some of their biological functions, ways in which GBPs are identified, and challenges in defining their biologically relevant ligands. The chapters that follow describe the analysis of glycan–protein interactions (Chapter 29), the physical principles involved (Chapter 30), and the structures and biological functions of important subclasses of GBPs (Chapters 31–38). GBPs (which exclude glycan-specific antibodies) are found in all living organisms and fall into two overarching groups—lectins and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (compared in Online Appendix 28A). Lectins are further classified into evolutionarily related families identified by carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) based on primary and/or three-dimensional structural similarities (Figure 28.1). CRDs can exist as stand-alone proteins or as domains within larger multidomain proteins. They typically recognize terminal groups on glycans, which fit into shallow but well-defined binding pockets (Chapters 29 and 30). In contrast, proteins that bind to sulfated GAGs (heparan, chondroitin, dermatan, and keratan sulfates; Chapter 17) do so via clusters of positively charged amino acids that bind specific arrangements of carboxylic acid and sulfate groups along GAG chains. Most of these proteins are evolutionarily unrelated. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GAG hyaluronic acid (hyaladherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that facilitates recognition of short segments of the invariant hyaluronan repeating disaccharide (Chapter 16), so they are best classified as lectins rather than grouped with sulfated GAG-binding proteins. The rest of this chapter emphasizes lectins, different families of which are detailed in Chapters 31–37. Sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also discussed, and are detailed further in Chapter 38. Representative structures from four common animal lectin families. The emphasis is on the extracellular domain structure and topology. The following are the defined carbohydrate-binding domains (CRDs) shown: (CL) C-type lectin; (GL) galectin; (MP) P-type (more...) Lectins were discovered in plants in 1888 when extracts of castor bean seeds were found to agglutinate animal red blood cells. Subsequently, seeds of many plants were found to contain such “agglutinins,” later renamed lectins (Latin for “select”) when they were found to distinguish human ABO blood groups (Chapter 14), important for blood transfusions. Lectins are particularly common in the seeds of leguminous plants and these “L-type” lectins, including concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin, have been extensively studied. Although their specific glycan-binding activities make such plant lectins extremely useful scientific tools, their biological functions in plants remain mostly unknown. The first animal lectin discovered was the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) identified by Anatol Morell and Gilbert Ashwell in the late 1960s during investigations of the turnover of a serum glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin. Like most glycoproteins circulating in blood, ceruloplasmin has complex N-glycans with sialic acid termini. To prepare radiolabeled ceruloplasmin, the terminal sialic acids were removed, leaving an exposed galactose. Surprisingly, asialoceruloplasmin had a circulation half-life (in rabbits) of minutes, whereas intact ceruloplasmin remained in the blood for hours.'
 'Many of the murine mAbs to glycan antigens are of the IgM isotype. However, if the animal is well-immunized and serum titers are high, IgGs are frequently generated (e.g., ∼35% of the plant-glycan-directed mAbs are IgG). The higher valency of IgM antibodies that form pentamers or hexamers can affect the binding specificity. Some antibodies to glycan antigens are commercially available, whereas others are obtainable only from individual laboratories or stock centers. Some antibodies against mammalian antigens are shown in Figures 48.5 and 48.6, and they recognize terminal glycan determinants, although subterminal sequences may also be required for binding and or in some cases may decrease binding. Many of the antibodies generated to date against plant glycans recognize internal structural features of these polysaccharides. Several antibodies against the plant cell wall homogalacturonans or xylans bind to internal backbone residues, frequently with varying sensitivities as to the level of backbone substitution by either glycan or nonglycan substituents. In some cases, the length of the unsubstituted backbone that is recognized by an antibody varies, thereby allowing the antibodies to be used to identify variations in backbone substitution density. In addition, the context of expression (free glycan vs. glycoprotein vs. glycolipid) or the class of glycan (N- vs. O-linked) may play a significant role in determining specificity and affinity. For example, antibodies to the 6-sulfo-SLex antigen require the fucose, sialic acid, and GlcNAc-6-O-sulfate residues. In contrast, the MECA-79 antibody recognizes extended core-1 O-glycans that contain internal GlcNAc-6-O-sulfate residues; it does not require either the fucose or sialic acid for recognition, but it does require the core-1 O-glycan. There are also many mAbs that recognize different glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans. With the growing understanding of the principles of glycan recognition (Chapter 29), there have been several novel glycan-detection reagents reported based on engineering mutant forms of endogenous lectins (engineered lectin) or carbohydrate-processing enzymes. Recombinant and engineered proteins can offer advantages over lectins or antibodies. They may be expressed, often in Escherichia coli, as opposed to being isolated from plant, fungal, or animal sources. Expression reduces batch variations that may result from isolation and offers a scalable solution to the demand for reagents. With protein engineering being based on the ever-increasing number of crystal structures of oligosaccharide-protein complexes, the structural origin of the specificity of an engineered protein may be well-understood. This stands in contrast to the case of antibodies that may be specific, but are rarely analyzed crystallographically, and thus the molecular origin of their specificity often remains unknown. For this reason, it is challenging to predict or interpret antibody specificity or cross-reactivity between glycans. In recent years, there has been increased interest in recombinant lectins derived from bacterial adhesins (e.g., “Siglec-like” binding regions [SLBRs] from Streptococcus mutans) and engineered lectins with altered specificities. Another avenue of new reagents has been the conversion of enzymes into reagents for detecting substrates. The concept was demonstrated more than 40 years ago, with anhydrotrypsin serving as an early example. In the specific case of glycan-binding reagents derived from inactivated glycosylhydrolases or other enzymes, the specificity is conferred by the endogenous enzyme, which is often well known. Inactivation—for example, by point mutation of the catalytic nucleophile—generally leads to a protein that retains the desired specificity and may still retain sufficient affinity to be useful as a detection reagent. As an example, an inactivated bacteriophage-derived endosialidase has been shown to have lectin-like properties and can be used as a probe in the specific detection of its substrate, polysialic acid. More often, however, the inactivated enzyme requires additional engineering to amplify its affinity and/or improve its selectivity/specificity for the glycan substrate of interest.']","In 1975, a novel lectin of ∼15 kDa was isolated from electric organs of the electric eel, and named “electrolectin.” This noncovalently linked homodimer displayed hemagglutinating activity toward trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes that was inhibitable by β-galactosides; inclusion of β-mercaptoethanol in the isolation buffers was required to maintain the binding activity.","Soon thereafter, in 1976, similar β-galactoside-binding lectins were isolated from chicken muscle and from extracts of calf heart and lung (∼15 kDa; now designated as galectin-1). These proteins were initially referred to as S-type lectins to denote their sulfhydryl dependency, presence of free cysteine residues, and solubility, along with shared primary sequence. In the early 1980s, a 35-kDa protein termed CBP35 that also bound to β-galactosides was identified in mouse fibroblasts. The same protein was studied by other groups under the names IgE-binding protein, L-29, and L-31 and is currently known as galectin-3. The nomenclature for galectins was systematized in 1994 and the first galectin type found (∼15 kDa, discussed above) retained the name galectin-1.

Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity. Because the adhesins and the receptors often cluster in the plane of the membrane, the resulting combinatorial avidity can be great. An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips. The most well-characterized bacterial lectins include the mannose-specific type-1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding F-17 fimbriae, which are produced by different strains of Escherichia coli. Fimbriated bacteria express 100 to 400 of these appendages, which typically have a diameter of 5–7 nm and can extend hundreds of nanometers in length (Figure 37.3) Thus, pili extend well beyond the bacterial glycocalyx comprised of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharides (see Chapter 21). Escherichia coli express hundreds of pili, as indicated by the fine filaments extending from the bacterium. (Reprinted, with permission of Elsevier, from Sharon N. 2006.

This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells. Uroplakin Ia presents high levels of terminally exposed mannose residues that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers.

 ""Both receptors bind with highest affinity to glycans carrying two M6P residues (Figure 33.2, structure C) whereas only the CI-MPR interacts with molecules bearing GlcNAc-P-Man phosphodiesters (Figure 33.2, structures A and B). Binding to molecules carrying one M6P (Figure 33.2, structure D) is intermediate in affinity. Removal of outer mannose residues by processing Golgi mannosidases enhances binding. Genes encoding both MPRs have been cloned and extensively characterized. Both are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with extracytoplasmic, transmembrane, and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The CI-MPR has 15 contiguous repetitive units of ∼145 amino acids with partial identity to one another. The CD-MPR has a single extracellular domain, showing homology with the repeating domains of the CI-MPR (Figure 33.4A). Together with conservation of certain intron–exon boundaries, this homology suggests that the two genes evolved from a common ancestor. On the basis of their sequence relationships and unique binding properties to M6P, the two MPRs have been formally classified as P-type lectins. Structural homologs of the MPRs are present in yeast and Drosophila, but these proteins lack M6P-binding ability.

Shown are the two monomers (magenta and cyan ribbons) of the dimer as well as the ligand M6P (gold (more...) The CD-MPR exists mainly as a dimer, with each monomer binding one M6P residue. The CI-MPR also seems to be a dimer in the membrane, although it readily dissociates on solubilization. Two of its repeating units (3 and 9) bind M6P phosphomonoesters with high affinity, a third (5) binds M6P phosphodiesters, and a fourth (15) binds both M6P phosphomonoesters and diesters with equal affinity. Mutagenesis studies have identified the specific residues of these receptors involved in M6P binding, and crystal structures of several M6P-binding domains have been obtained in complex with M6P. Comparison of the binding pockets reveals four residues (Gln, Arg, Glu, Tyr) are positionally conserved and form the same contacts with the mannose ring. The CD-MPR has been crystallized as a dimer, with each monomer folded into a nine-stranded flattened β-barrel that has a striking resemblance to the protein folds in avidin (Figure 33.4B). The distance between the two ligand-binding sites of the dimer provides a good explanation for the differences in binding affinity shown by the CD-MPR toward various lysosomal enzymes. Crystal structures of recombinant forms of the CI-MPR have also been solved that encompass all but two of the 15 contiguous domains in its extracellular region (i.e., domains 1–5, domains 7–11, and domains 11–14). Each domain shows a topology similar to that of the CD-MPR. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the CI-MPR isolated from bovine liver has been carried out under conditions: (1) not conducive to ligand binding (pH 4.5), and (2) found at the cell surface (pH 7.4) and bound to the non-glycosylated ligand, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) via CI-MPR's domain 11. Although the cryo-EM structure at pH 7.4 is unable to visualize the N- (domains 1–3) and C- (domain 15) termini with sufficient resolution, it does provide insight into the arrangement of the entire extracellular region of the CI-MPR. The proposed cryo-EM model does not position the two M6P-binding domains (3 and 9) sufficiently close to bind a single, diphosphorylated N-glycan.""
 'The heparin fragment ([GlcNS6Sα1-4IdoA2Sα1-4]3) was helical and bound to a turn-rich heparin-binding site on the surface of FGF2. Only one N-sulfo group and the 2-O-sulfo group from the adjacent iduronic acid are bound to the growth factor in the turn-rich binding domain, and the next GlcNS residue is bound to a second site, consistent with the minimal binding sequence determined with oligosaccharide fragments. Unlike antithrombin–heparin interaction, no significant conformational change in FGF2 occurs on heparin binding. The crystal structure of acidic FGF (FGF1) has also been solved and shows similar sequences on its surface. However, the oligosaccharide sequence that binds with high affinity to FGF1 contains 6-O-sulfo groups. Crystal and solution structures of GAG–protein complexes.

The cocrystal structure of the complex of (FGF2-FGFR)2, first solved in the absence of heparin/HS ligand, showed a canyon of positively charged amino acid residues, suggestive of an unoccupied heparin-binding site. Subsequently, the heparin–oligosaccharide-containing complex was solved after introduction of heparin oligosaccharides, suggesting a 2:2:2 complex of FGF2:FGFR1:HS (Figure 38.3). Another important feature of this complex is the orientation of the nonreducing ends of the HS chains that terminate in an N-sulfoglucosamine residue, which arises by endolytic cleavage of chains by the enzyme heparanase (Chapter 17). The structure of the FGF1–FGFR2–HS complex is not without controversy; structural analysis of complexes formed in solution and purified by gel filtration has suggested a very different structure consisting of a 2:2:1 complex (Figure 38.3). Chemokines are another class of proteins exhibiting strong interactions with GAGs. However, these interactions do not directly affect activities of inhibitors or signaling molecules as in previous examples. Instead, they stabilize chemotactic gradients of chemokines; these gradients, in turn, direct leukocytes to sites of injury or infection. They may also facilitate cell migration through the endothelial layer of the blood vessels in which they circulate. This is no easy task; blood is flowing rapidly in these vessels and would easily destroy gradients in the absence of these interactions. CCL5, also called RANTES, is a member of a chemokine subclass that has two adjacent cysteines (CC) near its amino terminus. It is among the earliest discovered and among the most studied of the chemokines. CCL5 binds both HS and CS; but given the abundance of CS chains in normal plasma and the association of CS proteoglycans with vascular development and disease, a specific discussion of CCL5–CS interactions seems appropriate. Although CCL5 is a small protein (∼8 kDa), it exists primarily as dimers (Kd<1 µM) that assemble into larger filamentous structures, especially in the presence of GAGs. These characteristics have made it difficult to study CCL5 structurally. Most studies have involved a mutated form (E66S) and/or study at lower pH—conditions that limit oligomerization to a dimer. Nevertheless, complementary solution data, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have allowed construction of filament models, both with and without GAGs present. Figure 38.3D shows a model of a tetramer built on the known dimer structure (PDB id, 1U4L) and complexed with CS hexamers 4-O-sulfated on all three N-acetylgalactosamine residues of the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc repeats. Individual dimers are shown as green and sea green ribbons.'
 'In particular, these structures are recognized by the mannose receptor and by dectin-2. These are C-type lectins expressed by immune cells that are important in both innate and adaptive immune responses (see Chapter 34). PLM antigens may be shed by C. albicans and, through interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLR-2), they can induce nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and cytokine responses such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. Galectin-3, a ubiquitous member of the galectin family of lectins that is highly expressed in macrophages, also appears to recognize C. albicans expressing β1-2-linked mannose residues, resulting in opsonization of the yeast. A. fumigatus is an environmental mold that spreads by airborne particles. It causes serious invasive disease in immunocompromised people that is difficult to treat, leading to high mortality rates. As with other fungal pathogens, the surface glycans of A. fumigatus are critical for interactions with the host. The cell wall of infectious forms of this fungus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors. The hyphal wall has a core of branched β1-3-glucan covalently linked to other glucan components, chitin, and galactomannan, which consists of a mannose backbone with short galactofuranose side chains. Interestingly, galactomannan also occurs anchored to the plasma membrane by a GPI. This polysaccharide is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and is probably transferred to the cell wall by transglycosidases, in the same way as GPI-anchored proteins. A. fumigatus also produces an extracellular matrix composed of monosaccharides, α1-3-glucan, galactomannan, and a galactosaminogalactan composed of variable galactopyranose repeats linked to N-acetylgalactosamine, which are partially de-acetylated. This structure has been implicated in adhesion and fungal virulence. The extracellular matrix also plays an important role in concealing the immunogenic β1-3 glucan layer from the immune system. C. neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental basidiomycete yeast that causes severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, leading to roughly half a million deaths per year worldwide. It is unique among pathogenic fungi in having an extensive polysaccharide capsule that is required for virulence (Figure 23.6). The capsule is a dynamic structure that changes in thickness and composition depending on the environment and growth conditions. It is particularly large in the context of mammalian infection, in which it impedes host immune responses. It is composed of two large (millions of Da) polysaccharides named for their monosaccharide components: glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal). GXM is an extended α1-3 mannan substituted with β1-2Xyl, β1-4Xyl, and β1-2GlcA (Figure 23.7); a subset of the mannose residues are 6-O-acetylated (not shown). The second polymer, GXMGal, is based on α1-6 galactan, with side chains of galactose, glucuronic acid, mannose, and xylose (Figure 23.7); the backbone is also modified with small amounts of β1-2-linked galactofuranose (not shown). Association of the capsule with the cell surface relies on a cell-wall component, α1-3 glucan. Although α1-3 glucan is not present in the cell walls of S. cerevisiae or C. albicans, it is common in other fungi. N-glycans of C. neoformans are generally high mannose with modest outer chain extensions and may include xylose β1-2-linked to the trimannosyl core. Both N- and O-glycans may also be modified with xylose and xylose phosphate. A quick-freeze deep-etch image of the edge of a Cryptococcus neoformans cell.'
 'HMO structures have been characterized by advanced glycomic analytical tools such as liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (see Chapter 50). Hundreds of structures have been observed, although one mother typically produces about 100 structures. There are two HMO phenotypes (from four genotypes) that determine the types of structures in the milk. Mothers who secrete their blood type or the Lewis b epitope are termed secretors. Secretors produce structures that contain α1-2-linked fucose. Nonsecretors produce little or no α1-2-linked fucose but instead produce fucosylated glycans that are primarily (1-3)- or (1-4)-linked. One of the most abundant components in milk of secretor mothers is 2-fucosyllactose, whereas nonsecretor mothers produce very little or none of this compound. Similarly, secretor milk is slightly richer in fucosylated compounds, whereas nonsecretor milk is slightly richer in sialylated compounds. HMOs have altered our concept of the function of food. Human milk was thought to be primarily nutritive. However, despite the large abundances of HMOs in the milk, there are no human enzymes in the infant gut that can degrade them. Instead, characterization of the gut microbiome of infants have revealed that HMOs are primarily food for the gut bacteria. Indeed, Bifidobacteria, found in the microbiome of heathy breastfed infants, have glycosyl hydrolases that specifically catabolize HMOs. Additionally, HMOs may also have a protective role by blocking the binding of pathogens in the gut. Linkage variation plays an important role in the structural properties of polysaccharides as illustrated for two closely related glucose polymers having repeating units (RUs) of -[4Glcβ1-]n and -[4Glcα1-]n. The former is the structural polymer, cellulose, that forms the foundation of all plant cell walls and is a major component of materials such as wood and cotton. The latter is starch, an easily digestible material with no significant structural utility. The ability of one polymer to associate in long fibrils having both crystalline and amorphous regions contributing to its structural properties, and the lack of these tendencies in the other polymer, is clearly linked to the stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon (β for cellulose and α for starch) and the preferred torsional angles about the C1′-O4 and O4-C4 bonds of the glycosidic linkages. The torsion angles are referred to as φ and ψ, much the same as primary structural variables in polypeptides; by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) convention they are defined by four connected atoms, O5′-C1′-O4-C4 and C1′-O4-C4-C3, respectively. Because the torsion angle can be monitored directly through couplings between protons at the ends of the glycosidic linkage observed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, an alternate NMR definition is also in common use—namely, H1′-C1′-O4-C4 for φ and C1′-O4-C4-H4 for ψ. Glycosidic torsion angles differ considerably in crystalline cellulose and starch. Using IUPAC definitions they prefer ∼−95° and ∼+95° in the former and ∼+115° and ∼+120° in the latter. Figure 3.2 depicts these differences in the repeating disaccharide units of cellulose and starch as represented by the isolated disaccharides having common names cellobiose and maltose, respectively. These local preferences influence association properties and ultimately structural characteristics. When extended to a long cellulose polymer, cellobiose units generate elongated strands that can pack and interact with other strands through hydrogen bonds to form layers. Layers in turn interact through a combination of forces to form fibrils composed of 18 polymer chains. The more helical strands in starch cannot pack easily and result in a more amorphous material.']","The ""catch-bond"" properties of FimH result in the binding strength of individual FimH adhesins being augmented by increasing the shear forces on surface-bound E. coli cells.","This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells.

Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers. The resulting bacterial aggregates are flushed out of the urinary tract.

Etzler, and Ajit Varki. This chapter provides an overview of naturally occurring glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), the history of their discovery, some of their biological functions, ways in which GBPs are identified, and challenges in defining their biologically relevant ligands. The chapters that follow describe the analysis of glycan–protein interactions (Chapter 29), the physical principles involved (Chapter 30), and the structures and biological functions of important subclasses of GBPs (Chapters 31–38). GBPs (which exclude glycan-specific antibodies) are found in all living organisms and fall into two overarching groups—lectins and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (compared in Online Appendix 28A). Lectins are further classified into evolutionarily related families identified by carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) based on primary and/or three-dimensional structural similarities (Figure 28.1). CRDs can exist as stand-alone proteins or as domains within larger multidomain proteins. They typically recognize terminal groups on glycans, which fit into shallow but well-defined binding pockets (Chapters 29 and 30). In contrast, proteins that bind to sulfated GAGs (heparan, chondroitin, dermatan, and keratan sulfates; Chapter 17) do so via clusters of positively charged amino acids that bind specific arrangements of carboxylic acid and sulfate groups along GAG chains. Most of these proteins are evolutionarily unrelated. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GAG hyaluronic acid (hyaladherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that facilitates recognition of short segments of the invariant hyaluronan repeating disaccharide (Chapter 16), so they are best classified as lectins rather than grouped with sulfated GAG-binding proteins. The rest of this chapter emphasizes lectins, different families of which are detailed in Chapters 31–37. Sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also discussed, and are detailed further in Chapter 38. Representative structures from four common animal lectin families. The emphasis is on the extracellular domain structure and topology. The following are the defined carbohydrate-binding domains (CRDs) shown: (CL) C-type lectin; (GL) galectin; (MP) P-type (more...) Lectins were discovered in plants in 1888 when extracts of castor bean seeds were found to agglutinate animal red blood cells. Subsequently, seeds of many plants were found to contain such “agglutinins,” later renamed lectins (Latin for “select”) when they were found to distinguish human ABO blood groups (Chapter 14), important for blood transfusions. Lectins are particularly common in the seeds of leguminous plants and these “L-type” lectins, including concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin, have been extensively studied. Although their specific glycan-binding activities make such plant lectins extremely useful scientific tools, their biological functions in plants remain mostly unknown. The first animal lectin discovered was the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) identified by Anatol Morell and Gilbert Ashwell in the late 1960s during investigations of the turnover of a serum glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin. Like most glycoproteins circulating in blood, ceruloplasmin has complex N-glycans with sialic acid termini. To prepare radiolabeled ceruloplasmin, the terminal sialic acids were removed, leaving an exposed galactose. Surprisingly, asialoceruloplasmin had a circulation half-life (in rabbits) of minutes, whereas intact ceruloplasmin remained in the blood for hours.'
 'NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.38 Ding Xu, James H. Prestegard, Robert J. Linhardt, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosaminoglycans bind to many different classes of proteins mostly through electrostatic interactions between negatively charged sulfate groups and uronic acids and positively charged amino acids in the protein. This chapter focuses on examples of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins, methods for measuring GAG–protein interaction, and information about three-dimensional structures of the complexes. In contrast to lectins, which tend to fall into evolutionarily conserved families (Chapters 28–37), GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds and instead appear to have evolved by convergent evolution. Several hundred GAG-binding proteins have been discovered, which make up the GAG-interactome and fall into the broad classes presented in Table 38.1. To a large extent, studies of the GAG-interactome have focused on protein interactions with heparin, a more highly sulfated, iduronic acid (IdoA)-rich form of heparan sulfate (HS; Chapter 17). This bias reflects, in part, the commercial availability of heparin and heparin-Sepharose, which are frequently used for fractionation studies, and the partially incorrect assumption that binding to heparin mimics binding to HS present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. There are also a large number of proteins known to interact with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) with comparable avidity and affinity; there are fewer examples of specific interactions with keratan sulfate (KS), but this may reflect fewer studies of KS. In some cases, CS may be the physiologically relevant ligand because CS predominates in many tissues. Determining the physiological relevance of these interactions is a major area of research. Examples of various classes of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins  Interactions between GAGs and proteins can have profound physiological effects on processes such as hemostasis, lipid transport and absorption, cell growth and migration, and development. Binding to GAGs can result in immobilization of proteins at their sites of production or in the extracellular matrix for future mobilization, regulation of enzyme activity, binding of proteins to their receptors, protein oligomerization, and protection of proteins against degradation. Several viruses and bacteria also exploit GAGs expressed in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces as attachment factors. For example, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, enters through the respiratory tract and infects epithelial cells lining the airways by interactions of the viral spike protein with heparan sulfate. The ability of virions to attach to cell-surface heparan sulfate facilitates capture of the virus and transfer to proteinaceous receptors (e.g., host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in the case of SARS-CoV-2) as well as subsequent viral glycoprotein processing and infection. The interactions of GAG-binding proteins are often driven by a general complementarity of charge (e.g., thrombin–heparin interactions). In some cases, the interaction has been shown to depend on rare but specific sequences of modified sugars in the GAG chain (e.g., antithrombin binding). Numerous methods are available for analyzing GAG–protein interactions, and some provide a direct measurement of Kd values. A common method involves affinity fractionation of proteins on Sepharose columns containing covalently linked GAG chains, usually heparin. The bound proteins are eluted with different concentrations of sodium chloride, and the concentration required for elution is generally proportional to the Kd. High-affinity interactions require 0.5–2 m NaCl to displace bound ligand, which usually translates into Kd values of 10−7–10−9 m (determined under physiological salt concentrations by equilibrium binding).'
 'Like most glycoproteins circulating in blood, ceruloplasmin has complex N-glycans with sialic acid termini. To prepare radiolabeled ceruloplasmin, the terminal sialic acids were removed, leaving an exposed galactose. Surprisingly, asialoceruloplasmin had a circulation half-life (in rabbits) of minutes, whereas intact ceruloplasmin remained in the blood for hours. Glycoproteins with exposed Gal residues were rapidly cleared into liver cells via an endocytic cell-surface receptor that specifically bound to terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc. ASGPR was purified by affinity chromatography using a column of immobilized asialoglycoprotein. Other glycan-specific receptors involved in glycoprotein clearance and targeting were subsequently discovered, including mannose 6-phosphate receptors for targeting lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes (Chapter 33) and mannose receptors that clear glycoproteins with terminal mannose or GlcNAc residues from the blood. Small soluble lectins specific for β-linked galactose (now called “galectins”; Chapter 36) were isolated by affinity chromatography of extracts from many biological sources ranging from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum to mammalian tissues. By the 1980s, the concept of vertebrate lectins that recognize specific glycans was well established. Although the first animal lectins identified were specific for endogenous glycans, many lectins specific for exogenous glycans of microorganisms were later found. Lectins recognizing exogenous glycans include soluble proteins that circulate in the blood of many species as well as membrane-bound receptors on cells of the immune system. Lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins are also widespread in microorganisms, although they tend to be called by other names such as hemagglutinins and adhesins. The influenza virus hemagglutinin, which binds to sialic acid on host cells (Chapter 15), was the first GBP isolated from a microorganism. The viral hemagglutinins, like many plant lectins, can agglutinate red blood cells. Many bacterial lectins have also been described. They fall into two general classes: adhesins on bacterial surfaces that recognize glycans on host cell-surface glycolipids, glycoproteins, or GAGs to facilitate bacterial adhesion and colonization, and secreted bacterial toxins that bind to host cell-surface glycolipids or glycoproteins (Chapter 37). A large group of GBPs that defy classification based on sequence or structure recognizes sulfated GAGs (Chapter 38). The best-studied example is the interaction of heparin with antithrombin. Heparin was discovered in 1916 by Jay McLean, as a medical student, but it was not until 1939 that heparin was shown to be an anticoagulant in the presence of “heparin cofactor,” which was then identified as antithrombin in the 1950s. Many other sulfated GAG-binding proteins were later discovered by affinity chromatography using columns of immobilized heparin. Growth factors and cytokines bearing clusters of positively charged amino acids along their protein surface interact with sulfated GAGs in a looser fashion—that is, they do not always show the high specificity seen with antithrombin. However, in some cases, specific GAG sequences mediate the formation of higher-order complexes, acting as a template for oligomerization or positioning of proteins such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its cell-surface receptor. GBPs function in communication between cells in multicellular organisms and in interactions between microbes and hosts and can also be involved in binding growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. These interactions can take various forms, resulting in movement of molecules, cells, and information. Directing movement of glycoproteins within and between cells is a common function for lectins in many organisms. In eukaryotic cells, including yeast as well as “higher” eukaryotes, several groups of lectins are important in glycoprotein biosynthesis and intracellular movement (Chapter 39).'
 'In addition to the widely distributed families, certain CRD families are evolutionarily restricted. In addition to animal-specific and vertebrate-specific lectin groups, there are also groups such as the I-type lectins found only in mammals (Chapter 35). The pattern of evolution of animal-specific lectins varies. Galectins seem to be similar in organization in vertebrates and invertebrates, and it may be possible to identify orthologs in quite diverse species (Chapter 36). In contrast, C-type CRDs have undergone independent radiation in vertebrates and invertebrates, and identifying orthologs even between mouse and human proteins in some cases is difficult (Chapter 34). Of the 12 different protein folds found in plant lectins, six appear to be unique to plants. It is also noteworthy that viruses seem to have developed their own approaches to binding glycans rather than borrowing from hosts (Chapter 37). In addition to families of proteins that share evolutionarily related CRDs, there are individual proteins that bind glycans through domains that are not related to CRDs in other proteins. Examples include proteins with dedicated glycan-binding domains, such as some laminin G domains that recognize glycans on α-dystroglycan (Chapter 45), pentraxins that bind modified and phosphorylated glycans, and macrophage αMβ2 integrin that binds fungal glucans and exposed GlcNAc residues on glycoproteins. Other proteins bind to glycans through domains that also have other ligands: Annexin V binds bisecting GlcNAc residues as well as phospholipids, and several cytokines have been reported to bind glycans as well as nonglycan receptors. Sulfated-GAG-binding proteins have also largely evolved by convergent evolution. There are multiple ways in which glycan recognition can be implicated in specific biological processes. One common approach is to show the ability of simple monosaccharides or small glycans to compete with a process. Information can often also be gained by modifying glycans on cells and glycoproteins with enzymes that add or remove glycans, by genetic manipulation, and by chemical inhibitors of glycan metabolism. These strategies have provided information about the glycans involved—for example, those needed for virus or toxin binding or those required for endocytosis of glycoproteins. Based on this information, it is then possible to look for GBPs that target these particular glycans, which can then be linked to the biological process. The ability to bind specific glycans, assessed in various biochemical assays, has often been the basis for direct identification of novel GBPs without reference to a particular biological function. For example, most galectins (Chapter 36) share a binding preference for β-galactosides and F-type lectins for fucosyl residues. In addition to forming a basis for binding and competition assays, the binding activity is commonly used as a means of isolating these proteins by using affinity chromatography with appropriate immobilized glycan ligands. A wide variety of methods for coupling monosaccharides and complex glycans to create affinity resins have been developed. As mentioned above, many sulfated-GAG-binding proteins have been discovered by affinity chromatography using immobilized GAG chains. A limitation of these approaches is that binding activity does not directly indicate a biological function and the roles of many well-characterized GBPs have not been fully determined. The observation that many lectins fall into structurally distinct families provides an alternative way to identify novel GBPs through analysis of protein sequences. Sequence motifs characteristic of CRDs are routinely used to screen sequences from whole genome sequencing. These motifs can also be used to screen specific cDNA and gene sequences of interest because of their association with biological functions. Detection of an appropriate motif suggests the presence of a CRD, and structural knowledge of known glycan-binding sites can suggest whether a novel protein is likely to retain glycan-binding activity. In some cases, it can even suggest potential ligands. Such predictions often motivate testing for glycan-binding activity, either by specifically examining binding to predicted ligands or by screening more generally using glycan arrays. Although structure-based predictions do not directly yield information about biological function, the organization of CRDs and their association with other domains often provide information about potential functions. This type of top–down analysis is limited to discovery of GBPs that contain domains resembling known CRDs.'
 'Several major structural families of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) and their biological distributions. (CBM) carbohydrate-binding module; (EUL) Euonymus europaeus lectin; (ABA) Agaricus bisporus agglutinin; (EDEM) ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like (more...) GBPs appear across all domains of life, but the types of lectins in each kingdom vary considerably. Several families appear in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their distributions suggest different evolutionary histories. The malectin domain, although conserved in structure and widely distributed in prokaryotes, plants, and animals, is found in proteins with distinct domain organization and different functions in the three groups. Animal malectin is a membrane-anchored CRD of the ER that binds N-linked glycans during glycoprotein biosynthesis. In plants, the malectin CRD is expressed at the cell surface and is linked to a cytoplasmic kinase domain. Bacterial malectins consist of CRDs associated with glycohydrolase domains. Similarly, R-type CRDs (Chapter 31) in plants form the cell-surface-binding component of toxins such as ricin and are linked to glycohydrolase genes in bacteria, but in animals they appear in two distinct contexts: in polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases that initiate O-GalNAc glycans (Chapter 10) and in the mannose receptor family. Although these CRDs have been adapted to serve different functions in different kingdoms, a glycan-binding function appears to have evolved early and been preserved in subsequent lineages. In contrast to CRDs with broad evolutionary distribution, two other groups of lectins have sporadic distributions. B-Lectin domains, which are broadly distributed in bacteria in association with hydrolase domains, are found as isolated or tandem CRDs in monocot plants but not in other plants, in bony fishes but not in other animals, and in some fungi. The more recently identified F-type lectins appear in a few bacterial species and several “lower” vertebrates, but have not been found in mammals. In these instances, the presence of related domains in evolutionarily distant species may reflect lateral gene transfer rather than the presence of a precursor lectin in the distant common ancestor that they share. A different pattern of evolution is observed for PA14 domains, another type of CRD found in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Although the PA14 fold is relatively widespread, suggesting that it originated early and was retained across species, only a subset have been shown to have glycan-binding activity: CRDs associated with bacterial glycohydrolases and in adhesins and flocculation factors on the surface of yeast. Similarly, β-propeller lectins have evolved in multiple contexts because of their high avidity for glycans present on cell surfaces, and are present in bacteria, fungi, and animals. The intracellular sorting lectins mentioned earlier—such as calnexin, calreticulin, and M-type lectins—are the most broadly distributed lectins that evolved from a common eukaryotic ancestor. Their distribution and the conservation of their functions probably reflect an ancient and conserved role in intracellular trafficking of glycoproteins in eukaryotes. Two other groups of CRDs appear to be found in metazoans but not simpler eukaryotes. The L-type CRDs have diverged in function between animals, in which they function in intracellular glycoprotein sorting and trafficking, and plants, in which they serve a protective function (Chapter 32). Chitinase-like glycan-binding domains across a range of species retain the ability to bind polymers of GlcNAc, but their biological functions are not well-understood, so it is unclear if they have shared roles in plants and animals. In addition to the widely distributed families, certain CRD families are evolutionarily restricted. In addition to animal-specific and vertebrate-specific lectin groups, there are also groups such as the I-type lectins found only in mammals (Chapter 35). The pattern of evolution of animal-specific lectins varies. Galectins seem to be similar in organization in vertebrates and invertebrates, and it may be possible to identify orthologs in quite diverse species (Chapter 36).']","In contrast to lectins, which tend to fall into evolutionarily conserved families (Chapters 28–37), GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds and instead appear to have evolved by convergent evolution.

"Complete the following paragraph: NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins. The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages.","['They can serve as signals to localize the folding machinery and to signal the folding status of the polypeptide. To achieve glycan-mediated folding, N-glycans are recognized by two lectin-like chaperones in the ER: calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These specialized chaperones require Ca++ for activity and bind to monoglucosylated forms of N-glycans, thus retaining the protein in the ER until proper folding occurs. The ER also contains three enzymes central to the process: α-glucosidases I and II (GI and GII), which trim glucose (Glc) from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 initially transferred to the protein and release the glycoprotein from CNX/CRT. The enzyme UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) reglucosylates the N-glycan if proper folding has not occurred. Glycoproteins that fail to fold, or to oligomerize properly, are marked with specific truncated N-glycans, and eventually retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm in which they are destroyed by N-deglycosylation and proteasomal degradation, a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). There are several ERAD pathways, which are described in the following sections. Mature N-glycan. Lettering (a–n) follows the order of addition of monosaccharides in the synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (Chapter 9). α-Glucosidase I (GI) removes residue n, and α-glucosidase II (GII) removes residues (more...) N-Glycosylation in the ER is considerably different from other types of glycosylation. It begins with the “en bloc” transfer of a 14-monosaccharide glycan to the polypeptide as it exits the translocon complex (Chapter 9). In vertebrates, addition of the N-glycan occurs on incompletely folded polypeptides. In bacteria, N-glycosylation can occur both on nascent polypeptides and on fully mature proteins (Chapter 21). N-Glycans modify the physical properties of glycoproteins by providing noncharged, bulky, hydrophilic groups that keep the protein in solution during folding. They also modulate protein conformation by forcing amino acids near the N-glycan into a hydrophilic environment. N-Glycan processing starts immediately after transfer of the precursor sugar chain to the protein in the lumen of the ER. GI removes the terminal α1-2Glc and GII then removes both α1-3Glc units (Figure 39.1). Although GII may remove the second Glc (designated m in Figure 39.1) from glycoproteins with a single N-glycan, the trimming of the second Glc occurs more efficiently when there is a second N-glycan on the same protein. Depending on cell type, a variable number of Man residues may also be removed while glycoproteins remain in the ER. GII is an ER-soluble, heterodimeric protein. Its 100- to 110-kDa α-subunit contains the catalytic activity, whereas the 50- to 60-kDa β-subunit displays a canonical ER retention/retrieval sequence (XDEL), which is partially responsible for the subcellular location of the whole enzyme. The carboxy-terminal portion of the β-subunit contains a mannose receptor homologous (MRH) domain that is homologous to the domain in the Golgi mannose 6-phosphate receptor responsible for recognizing lysosomal enzymes and for their delivery to lysosomes (Chapters 9 and 33). The affinity of the GII MRH domain is higher for the Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) N-glycan and decreases for truncated N-glycans. Consequently, the GII activity toward N-glycans diminishes for truncated N-glycans created by ER mannosidases. CNX and CRT bind to glycoproteins containing a single α1–3Glc residue (Figure 39.2).'
 'Retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ultimately depends on various protein complexes, some of which contain integral ER membrane proteins. ER membrane proteins with folding defects in the cytosolic domain are extracted from the ER membrane by the Doa10 complex via ERAD-C, whereas those in which the folding defect is present in the luminal (ERAD-L) or membrane (ERAD-M) domains use the Hrd1 complex. Both Doa10p and Hrd1p are integral membrane proteins with E3 ligase activity in their cytosolic portion. Other proteins in these complexes include chaperones, proteins with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity or proteins that recognize misfolded proteins. For instance, glycoproteins with N-glycans containing a terminal α1–6Man are bound by Yos9p and undergo ERAD only if the N-glycans are in unstructured protein, a feature recognized by Hrd3p in the Hrd1 complex. Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the pore by which ERAD-L substrates are actually transported to the cytosol has not been identified, it is known that the substrates must be unfolded in the ER lumen. Although studies on ERAD complexes have been mainly performed in S. cerevisiae, mammalian cells have homologs of nearly all proteins described in the yeast complexes. N-Glycans are removed from unfolded glycoproteins during proteasomal degradation. A cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, N-glycanase, NGLY1) plays an important role in both removing the glycan and constructing an efficient predegradation complex (Figure 39.3). NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins. The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages. First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. A cytoplasmic α-mannosidase cleaves up to four Man residues to generate Man5GlcNAc (Man c, d, e, f, and g in Figure 39.1). This glycan is then taken into the lysosome via an ATP-dependent lysosomal membrane transporter for final degradation to monosaccharides. Whether these free glycans have any function in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment before they are degraded has not been investigated. Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytoplasm, and lysosomes. Specific pathways exist for the degradation of free glycans released from misfolded glycoproteins and glycopeptides generated within the ER. Dolichol-linked (more...) Protein O-fucosyltransferases (Ofut1 in Drosophila; POFUT1 and POFUT2 in mammals) are soluble ER enzymes that O-fucosylate Ser/Thr residues. Ofut1 and POFUT1 add fucose to epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like repeats, whereas POFUT2 adds fucose to thrombospondin (TSR) type 1–like repeats (Chapter 13). EGF and TSR domains are present as tandem repeats in numerous proteins of multicellular organisms. Ofut1/POFUT1 and POFUT2 selectively fucosylate only properly folded protein domains, suggesting a role of this glycosylation in folding quality control. Indeed, several POFUT2 targets including ADAMTSL1 and ADAMTSL2 (scaffolding proteins in the extracellular matrix), ADAMTS9 (a matrix remodeling protease), and ADAMTS13 (the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease) strictly require O-fucosylation for efficient secretion.'
 'How do cells distinguish between misfolded glycoproteins and folding intermediates if both entities have almost identical structural features such as exposed hydrophobic patches? How do cells pull glycoproteins destined for degradation out from futile reglucosylation–deglucosylation cycles if those glycoproteins are indeed very efficiently glucosylated by UGGT? How are terminally misfolded glycoproteins driven to the proteasome for degradation? The key discriminating factor appears to be the structure of the truncated N-glycans that result from the relatively long stay of a misfolded glycoprotein in the ER lumen. Mammalian cells have, in addition to Man1B1, three additional homologs called EDEMs (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like) proteins, which initially were thought to be devoid of activity. However, when either Man1B1 or the EDEMs were individually knocked out in human or chicken cells, conversion of M9 to M8B (Figure 39.2) was mainly performed by EDEM2, and the contribution of Man1B1 to that particular demannosylation step was minimal. On the other hand, conversion of M8B to M7 lacking residues i and k (M7BC; Figure 39.1) was performed by EDEMs 1 and 3. Recent evidence suggests that Man1B1, initially considered as ER mannosidase I, localizes to Golgi, and appears to work as a backup enzyme to cleave off residue i in the Golgi as this residue is rather resistant to the action of Golgi α-mannosidase I. The M7BC isomer exposes an α1–6Man (residue j; Figure 39.1), which is specifically recognized by an ER lectin (OS9 in mammals and Yos9p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Like GII, this lectin also contains an MRH domain that binds N-glycans smaller than M9, including M7BC. OS9/Yos9p forms part of the complex that translocates misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol (ERAD-L; see below). Both the conversion of M9 to M8B and the conversion of M8B to M7BC are slow processes in mammalian cells when compared with deglucosylation reactions. This affords two checkpoints ensuring that only misfolded glycoproteins, and not folding intermediates, are driven toward proteasomal degradation after a relatively long ER residence. In yeast, only an ER α-mannosidase and one EDEM-like protein called Htm1p are present. The former transforms M9 to M8B very rapidly in practically all glycoproteins, whereas the latter converts M8B to M7BC slowly, thus affording only one checkpoint for the exclusive degradation of terminally misfolded glycoproteins. Htm1p forms a complex with PDI. More recent evidence further suggests that mammalian EDEMs act as active α-mannosidases forming complexes with distinct oxidoreductases. In the case of yeast the oxidoreductase-Htm1p association enhances the α-mannosidase activity of the latter and the complex participates in the recognition of ERAD substrates. However, not all glycoproteins with N-glycans terminating in α1–6Man are driven to degradation. For instance, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl acetyl-coenzyme-A reductase, a key ER enzyme in sterol biosynthesis, carries Man5GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 N-glycans that do not target it for degradation (see below). Retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ultimately depends on various protein complexes, some of which contain integral ER membrane proteins. ER membrane proteins with folding defects in the cytosolic domain are extracted from the ER membrane by the Doa10 complex via ERAD-C, whereas those in which the folding defect is present in the luminal (ERAD-L) or membrane (ERAD-M) domains use the Hrd1 complex.'
 'UGGT also glucosylates incompletely assembled multimeric complexes of fully mature monomers because it recognizes hydrophobic surfaces exposed in the absence of the appropriate subunits. UGGT is a relatively large, soluble, ER protein (150- to 170-kDa) that uses UDP-Glc as sugar donor and requires millimolar Ca++ concentrations, typically found within the ER lumen. UGGT has at least two domains. The amino-terminal one, comprising ∼80% of the molecule, recognizes abnormal protein conformers. This domain contains three tandemly repeated, thioredoxin-like domains that are frequently found in ER proteins involved in protein folding and quality-control processes. A crystal structure of the third domain showed that it contains a large hydrophobic patch hidden by a flexible carboxy-terminal helix. The carboxy-terminal domain has homology with other glycosyltransferases and is responsible for the catalytic activity. Together, UGGT and the CNX/CRT complex ensure that only properly folded and multimerized glycoproteins move from the ER to the Golgi. Unlike GII, the activity of UGGT does not decrease on reduction of N-glycan Man content. Therefore, ER α-mannosidase catalyzed removal of Man from N-glycans results in longer half-lives of UGGT reaction products that may be recognized by CNX/CRT. It is possible that the differential activities of UGGT and GII toward N-glycans with reduced Man content provides glycoproteins with a last opportunity to achieve proper folding before proteasomal degradation. The ER folding and quality-control process is not foolproof, however. Some misfolded proteins escape the ER and others may misfold after they exit. Thus, there are additional checkpoints to correct mistakes that occur later in the secretory pathway. ER–Golgi intermediate compartment 53 (ERGIC53) is a type I membrane protein that binds to oligomannosyl N-glycans in a Ca++-dependent manner. Its luminal, carbohydrate-binding domain is similar to those of soluble lectins from leguminous plants. ERGIC53 cycles between the ER and the ERGIC. The mammalian protein contains both ER-targeting (dilysine) and ER-exit (diphenylalanine) determinants at its carboxyl terminus, which bind, respectively, to COPI and COPII coatomers involved in trafficking between the ER and Golgi. ERGIC53 loads a subset of glycoproteins (coagulation factors V and VIII and cathepsins C and Z) into COPII-coated vesicles leaving the ER for the Golgi. Mutation of ERGIC53 causes combined factor V and VIII deficiency, indicating an important role in secretion of these, and probably other glycoproteins. Vesicular integral protein 36 (VIP36) is another Golgi lectin that also binds glycoproteins containing oligomannosyl N-glycans. VIP36 may facilitate transport of glycoproteins from the ERGIC to cis-Golgi cisternae, or retrieve glycoproteins bearing N-glycans that did not undergo conversion to Man5GlcNAc2 by cis-Golgi α-mannosidases IA, IB, and/or IC. Conceivably, this would provide an opportunity for new rounds of trimming and eventual formation of complex N-glycans. Both ERGIC53 and VIP36 are up-regulated as part of the unfolded protein response. Whether other lectins recognizing specific glycans are involved in post-ER quality control is still an open question. Despite the presence of a battery of classical chaperones and the CNX/CRT/UGGT cycle in the ER, the process of glycoprotein folding is relatively inefficient, with as much as 80% of some newly made proteins never maturing. How do cells distinguish between misfolded glycoproteins and folding intermediates if both entities have almost identical structural features such as exposed hydrophobic patches? How do cells pull glycoproteins destined for degradation out from futile reglucosylation–deglucosylation cycles if those glycoproteins are indeed very efficiently glucosylated by UGGT?'
 'One beautiful example of how the fine sensitivity of UGGT allows modulation of basic physiological processes is its role during antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I). Here, MHC I complexes loaded with suboptimal peptides are recognized by UGGT, thus triggering their retention in the ER. On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface. Many congenital diseases such as lysosomal storage diseases also result in the accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER, thus overloading the folding machinery. An estimated 20%–30% of normal proteins misfold, so it is not surprising that small differences in the kinetics of conformational maturation and degradation can tip the balance to ERAD for lack of sufficient chaperones and other factors that facilitate folding. Although most glycoproteins transiently associate with CNX/CRT during their maturation in the ER in vivo, other ER folding and quality-control mechanisms do the job quite efficiently in cultured cells. However, viral glycoproteins such as vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, HIV glycoprotein gp120, and M protein from hepatitis B virus, absolutely require CNX/CRT for proper folding and exit from the ER. Several viruses use components of the ERAD machinery to evade immune surveillance in the host. For instance, cytomegalovirus proteins bind to MHC I complexes and deliver them to E3 ligase complexes that result in their eventual proteasomal degradation. Similarly, expression of HIV ER protein Vpu results in the proteasomal degradation of CD4. SV40 and proteins such as cholera toxin are retrotranslocated to the ER through the secretory pathway where they use some ERAD components to reach the cytosol where they produce deleterious effects.

"Complete the following paragraph: The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation.","['Retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ultimately depends on various protein complexes, some of which contain integral ER membrane proteins. ER membrane proteins with folding defects in the cytosolic domain are extracted from the ER membrane by the Doa10 complex via ERAD-C, whereas those in which the folding defect is present in the luminal (ERAD-L) or membrane (ERAD-M) domains use the Hrd1 complex. Both Doa10p and Hrd1p are integral membrane proteins with E3 ligase activity in their cytosolic portion. Other proteins in these complexes include chaperones, proteins with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity or proteins that recognize misfolded proteins. For instance, glycoproteins with N-glycans containing a terminal α1–6Man are bound by Yos9p and undergo ERAD only if the N-glycans are in unstructured protein, a feature recognized by Hrd3p in the Hrd1 complex. Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the pore by which ERAD-L substrates are actually transported to the cytosol has not been identified, it is known that the substrates must be unfolded in the ER lumen. Although studies on ERAD complexes have been mainly performed in S. cerevisiae, mammalian cells have homologs of nearly all proteins described in the yeast complexes. N-Glycans are removed from unfolded glycoproteins during proteasomal degradation. A cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, N-glycanase, NGLY1) plays an important role in both removing the glycan and constructing an efficient predegradation complex (Figure 39.3). NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins. The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages. First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. A cytoplasmic α-mannosidase cleaves up to four Man residues to generate Man5GlcNAc (Man c, d, e, f, and g in Figure 39.1). This glycan is then taken into the lysosome via an ATP-dependent lysosomal membrane transporter for final degradation to monosaccharides. Whether these free glycans have any function in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment before they are degraded has not been investigated. Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytoplasm, and lysosomes. Specific pathways exist for the degradation of free glycans released from misfolded glycoproteins and glycopeptides generated within the ER. Dolichol-linked (more...) Protein O-fucosyltransferases (Ofut1 in Drosophila; POFUT1 and POFUT2 in mammals) are soluble ER enzymes that O-fucosylate Ser/Thr residues. Ofut1 and POFUT1 add fucose to epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like repeats, whereas POFUT2 adds fucose to thrombospondin (TSR) type 1–like repeats (Chapter 13). EGF and TSR domains are present as tandem repeats in numerous proteins of multicellular organisms. Ofut1/POFUT1 and POFUT2 selectively fucosylate only properly folded protein domains, suggesting a role of this glycosylation in folding quality control. Indeed, several POFUT2 targets including ADAMTSL1 and ADAMTSL2 (scaffolding proteins in the extracellular matrix), ADAMTS9 (a matrix remodeling protease), and ADAMTS13 (the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease) strictly require O-fucosylation for efficient secretion.'
 'The Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol precursor translocates across the ER membrane bilayer via a “flippase” encoded by the RFT1 locus in yeast. Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol is extended by the addition of four Man and three Glc residues transferred from Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc, respectively. Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc donors are formed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane from GDP-Man and UDP-Glc. Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc must also be flipped across the ER membrane. Mammalian MPDU1 is an ER membrane protein necessary for the utilization of Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc in the ER lumen in the synthesis of the mature N-glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol (Figure 9.3). This 14-sugar glycan is transferred by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) to Asn in receptive Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons in protein regions that have translocated across the ER membrane. OST is a multisubunit protein complex in the ER membrane, except in the case of the kinetoplastids (Chapter 43). OST catalyzes the transfer of the oligosaccharide from Dol-P-P to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in newly synthesized regions of proteins during passage through the translocon into the ER. OST has a high specificity for the completely assembled oligosaccharide, which is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in most eukaryotes. When incomplete oligosaccharides are assembled, transfer efficiency is reduced, resulting in hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins that mature with empty N-glycan sites. All OST subunits are transmembrane proteins with between one and 13 transmembrane domains. The OST complex cleaves the high-energy GlcNAc-P bond, releasing Dol-P-P in the process (Figure 9.3). Yeast OST is comprised of eight different subunits Stt3p, Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost2p, Ost4p, Ost5p, and Ost3p or Ost6p. Stt3p is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The two OST complexes (containing either of the thioredoxin-subunit Ost3p or Ost6p) have a different protein–substrate specificity. The complexity of OST increases in multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are two different catalytic STT3 subunits that both associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins (homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively). The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER. On binding to the catalytic STT3 subunit, the client peptide adopts a 180° turn, making polypeptide folding a competing reaction for N-glycosylation. Indeed, the thioredoxin subunits of the OST complex (Ost3p/Ost6p; MAGT1/TUSC1) modulate the oxidative folding of the client polypeptide, thereby extending the polypeptide substrate range of OST. As of February 2021, the UniProt database reports 1911 N-glycosylation sites in yeast and 13,648 in murine glycoproteins. Following the covalent attachment of the 14-sugar glycan to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in a protein, processing reactions trim the N-glycan in the ER. The initial steps have key roles in regulating glycoprotein folding via interactions with ER chaperones that recognize specific features of the trimmed N-glycan (Chapter 39).'
 'Ofut1/POFUT1 and POFUT2 selectively fucosylate only properly folded protein domains, suggesting a role of this glycosylation in folding quality control. Indeed, several POFUT2 targets including ADAMTSL1 and ADAMTSL2 (scaffolding proteins in the extracellular matrix), ADAMTS9 (a matrix remodeling protease), and ADAMTS13 (the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease) strictly require O-fucosylation for efficient secretion. Indeed, O-fucosylation appears to stabilize folded TSRs. The case of Ofut1/POFUT1 is a bit more ambiguous. Studies performed in Drosophila on the efficiency of cell-surface expression of the Ofut1 substrate Notch showed that Ofut1 is required as a chaperone for Notch folding and cell-surface expression, and that chaperone activity is largely independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity. In contrast, POFUT1 does not appear to be absolutely required for cell-surface expression of Notch receptors in all mammalian cells, suggesting that cell-specific chaperones may be able to compensate for loss of POFUT1 in certain contexts. It has been reported recently that O-mannosylation in S. cerevisiae ER might be responsible for terminating futile cycles of association–dissociation between proteins unable to attain their native conformation and Kar2p (the budding yeast homolog of mammalian BiP/Grp78 chaperone). The loss of CNX and CRT in most multicellular organisms causes a severe phenotype. Mice deficient in CNX reach full term, but half die within 2 days of birth, and very few survive beyond 3 months. The runts that survive have obvious motor disorders with loss of large myelinated nerve fibers. CRT-deficient mice and ERp57-null mice also show embryonic lethality. In contrast, CNX and CRT null Caenorhabditis elegans mutants are viable. Yeast has CNX or CNX-like lectins (but not CRT), whereas trypanosomatid protozoa have only CRT. Another important conserved mammalian ER lectin resident is calmegin, expressed only in the testes during spermatogenesis. Calmegin shares ∼60% homology with CNX in mice. Mice deficient in calmegin are nearly sterile despite producing normal-looking sperm. The sperm are defective in migration into the oviducts and they do not adhere to the zona pellucida. UGGT is absent from S. cerevisiae but not from Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. The enzyme is not required for the viability of the fission yeast or single mammalian cells grown under normal conditions. The enzyme is also dispensable for growth of some multicellular organisms, such as plants. However, loss of UGGT is embryonically lethal in mice. This fact, as well of the strict requirement of UGGT for the viability of S. pombe cells only when grown under severe ER stress conditions, point to a restricted set of glycoproteins absolutely requiring UGGT for proper folding. In addition to combined factor V and VIII deficiency caused by ERGIC53 mutations (see above), other congenital diseases result in retention of defective proteins in the ER and their eventual proteasomal degradation. For instance, the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, CFTR-ΔF508, leads to improper folding of this chloride channel and its retention in the ER. Importantly, the mutation affects CFTR transit to the plasma membrane but not its transport activity. Similarly, UGGT recognition of a brassinosteroid receptor mutant triggers retention in the ER of Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Thus, certain diseases caused by ER retention of defective glycoproteins might be ameliorated by inhibitors of UGGT activity. One beautiful example of how the fine sensitivity of UGGT allows modulation of basic physiological processes is its role during antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I). Here, MHC I complexes loaded with suboptimal peptides are recognized by UGGT, thus triggering their retention in the ER. On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface.'
 'Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an ER-associated negative regulator of innate immunity. Mutations that affect TREX1 function are associated with numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Chapter 45). The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation. The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies. Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter. It is not known if these free glycans have any signaling functions in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment. In the lysosome, glycosidases hydrolyze the glycans into monomeric sugars that can then be reused by the cell. Mutations that disrupt NGLY1 function may cause severe health problems in humans. Studies with Ngly1 mutant mice cells suggest that in the absence of NGLY1, ERAD becomes dysfunctional because a cytosolic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase generates proteins that contain only a single Asn-linked GlcNAc instead of completely deglycosylated proteins. The accumulation of these GlcNAc-proteins may result in the formation of aggregates that are harmful to the cell or they may interfere with intracellular signaling processes. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are signaling glycans because they interact with receptor tyrosine kinases and/or their ligands and facilitate changes in cell behavior (Chapters 16, 17, and 38). Hyaluronan oligosaccharides bind to specific membrane proteins, including CD44. In some cells, this binding leads to clustering of CD44, which activates kinases such as c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 with regulatory and adaptor molecules that modulate cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell survival and proliferation (Figure 16.6). Signaling by hyaluronan oligosaccharides depends on the DP of the glycans. Low molecular weight glycans are more active in triggering danger responses via binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In contrast to hyaluronan-dependent signal transduction, signaling via sulfated GAGs such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate occurs by an indirect mechanism. Indeed, few membrane receptors have been described in which sulfated GAGs binding causes a specific downstream response, such as phosphorylation of the receptor or activation of a kinase. Instead, sulfated GAGs bind to many ligand/receptor pairs, thereby lowering the effective concentration of ligand required to engage the receptor or increasing the duration of the response. An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase.'
 'The affinity of the GII MRH domain is higher for the Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) N-glycan and decreases for truncated N-glycans. Consequently, the GII activity toward N-glycans diminishes for truncated N-glycans created by ER mannosidases. CNX and CRT bind to glycoproteins containing a single α1–3Glc residue (Figure 39.2). CNX is a type I transmembrane protein and CRT is soluble, but both have ER retention/retrieval signals at their carboxyl terminus, retaining them in the ER. They have structurally similar lectin domains and comprise part of a large, weakly associated heterogeneous protein network that includes BiP/Grp78, ERp57, Grp94, and other ER-resident proteins that assist protein folding. Thereby, they act as interpreters of the N-glycan code to localize the folding machinery to a glycoprotein substrate. Both CNX and CRT are monovalent, low-affinity lectins for monoglucosylated, oligomannosyl N-glycans, but because of their different membrane-bound or soluble status within the ER lumen, their in vivo specificities are not identical. CNX mainly interacts with N-glycans close to the ER membrane, whereas CRT binds preferentially to glycoproteins in the ER lumen or to those that have large luminal domains. Binding of incompletely folded glycoproteins to the CNX/CRT complex prevents their exit from the ER and enhances folding efficiency by preventing aggregation and premature oligomerization/degradation and by facilitating the formation of native disulfide bonds. This latter task is performed by ERp57, a CNX/CRT-associated oxidoreductase. CNX and CRT are, therefore, unconventional chaperones that do not directly recognize protein moieties of folding intermediates like conventional chaperones, but rather they recognize particular N-glycans in the folding intermediates. Model of quality control in glycoprotein folding. Proteins entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are N-glycosylated by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) as they emerge from the translocon (SEC61) (1). Two glucose (Glc) residues are removed by the (more...) Removal of the final Glc residue from N-glycans by GII prevents binding of the protein to CNX/CRT. If properly folded, these glycoproteins are packaged into COPII-coated vesicles and transferred to the Golgi (Figure 39.2). However, if they remain unfolded, UGGT adds a single α1–3Glc to the glycan, thus recreating the identical N-glycan first recognized by CNX/CRT. Therefore, UGGT has the remarkable property of exclusively glucosylating glycoproteins that display a nonnative conformation. UGGT discriminates between different nonnative conformers, and preferentially glucosylates glycoproteins in their last stages of folding when they are displaying exposed hydrophobic amino acid patches (molten globules). In vitro, the enzyme also recognizes N-glycans linked to relatively short hydrophobic peptides or to hydrophobic aglycones, although less efficiently. Contrary to BiP/Grp78 that preferentially binds extended hydrophobic “sequences,” UGGT recognizes hydrophobic “surfaces.” This difference determines that glycoproteins are first recognized by chaperones like BiP/Grp78 and only later, at final folding stages, are epitopes created by UGGT recognized by CNX/CRT. UGGT modifies N-glycans located in the relative vicinity of amino acids that prevent rapid folding of a glycoprotein. UGGT also glucosylates incompletely assembled multimeric complexes of fully mature monomers because it recognizes hydrophobic surfaces exposed in the absence of the appropriate subunits. UGGT is a relatively large, soluble, ER protein (150- to 170-kDa) that uses UDP-Glc as sugar donor and requires millimolar Ca++ concentrations, typically found within the ER lumen. UGGT has at least two domains. The amino-terminal one, comprising ∼80% of the molecule, recognizes abnormal protein conformers.']","This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies.

Glycans mediate or modulate numerous physiologic functions. This brief chapter focuses on vertebrate physiology (predominantly human), providing physiologists and physicians an overview of glycan impacts on organ system functions. Pathological aspects of glycan biosynthesis and degradation are discussed elsewhere. Given the breadth of physiologic functions of glycans, the individual sections highlight just a few representative examples, and listings are necessarily incomplete. Glycans and glycan-binding proteins are important for both male and female reproduction. Studies in fish, frogs, and mammals indicate that glycans are involved in multiple steps in the process of fertilization (Chapter 27).

Genetic modifications that eliminate initial steps of major glycan synthetic pathways and of some monosaccharide biosynthetic pathways generally result in embryonic lethality, with one exception being deletion of individual genes needed for initiation of mucin O-GalNAc pathway, likely because of functional redundancy among the 20 different polypeptide:O-GalNAc transferases (Chapter 10). The causes of these lethal outcomes usually cannot be linked to specific glycoconjugates, but sometimes can be ascribed to a single mechanism such as the disruption of protein O-fucosylation, which impacts global Notch receptor signaling (Chapter 13). Conversely, loss of terminal glycan modifications are usually not embryonic-lethal, instead they have specific defects in some cell types. Elimination of glycosaminoglycans also causes developmental abnormalities, most likely because of their roles in modulating growth factor function and in setting up morphogen gradients (Chapter 17). Although the elimination of glycosaminoglycans causes systemic developmental abnormalities, elimination of some proteoglycan core proteins that carry these glycans can have tissue-specific consequences (Chapters 17, 25, and 26). Given the significant role of glycans in development, many classic biomarkers of mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs), defined initially by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), unsurprisingly turned out to be glycans. Many of these markers are species-specific. For example, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), otherwise known as Lewis x (Lex) or CD15, is a principal marker of mouse ESCs but is not present on human ESCs. Instead, human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells express globosides SSEA-3 and SSEA-4, and MAbs also react with TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81, which detect keratan sulfate–related antigens and, also, the tetrasaccharide motif Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc. Glycans affect functions of all classes of blood cells. ABO blood group antigens on human erythrocytes are glycans, and successful blood transfusion requires compatibility of these antigens between donor and recipient (Chapter 14). Glycans on glycoproteins (e.g., integrin GPIIb/IIIa [CD41/CD61]) on the surfaces of circulating platelets play key roles in hemostasis.'

Tegner (more...) Sea urchin eggs are covered by a hydrated jelly coat. About 80% of the weight of egg jelly is a high-molecular-weight linear fucose (Fuc) sulfate polymer (FSP) with a molecular mass of >106 Da. Receptor proteins on sperm bind to FSP, triggering the opening of two pharmacologically distinct calcium channels that induce the exocytosis of the sperm's acrosome vesicle (the “acrosome reaction”). The ionic mechanisms that trigger the acrosome reaction are conserved in mammals, but the nature of the sperm surface receptors varies. FSP is a species-selective inducer of the sea urchin sperm acrosomal reaction and most FSPs are sulfated α1-3Fuc-based linear polymers made of tri- or tetrasaccharide repeats. The number of fucoses per repeat, the linkage, and sulfation patterns all help ensure species selectivity for induction of the acrosome reaction. About 20% of the egg jelly mass is a large glycoprotein containing a unique polymer of sialic acid (Sia), which can be released from crude sea urchin egg jelly by treatment with mild base (β-elimination). The sialoglycan has a novel structure—[Neu5Gcα2-5-O-glycolylNeu5Gc]n. However, its receptor on the sperm membrane is unknown. When sea urchin sperm undergo the acrosome reaction, a protein named bindin is released from the acrosomal vesicle. Bindin cements the sperm to a large egg surface glycoprotein named egg bindin receptor 1 (EBR1). Bindin can agglutinate mammalian red blood cells much like plant lectins (Chapter 32), and glycopeptide fragments of unfertilized eggs can block bindin-induced red cell agglutination. Bindin is thought to recognize glycans on EBR1. EBR1 itself has lectin-like domains, but its glycan ligands are unknown. Most studies of glycosylation in sea urchins have identified glycosyltransferase activities and the glycans they synthesize (e.g., including N-glycans with antennal β1-3-linked Gal, β1-4GalNAc, Neu5Gc, and sulphate residues as well as traces of the “invertebrate” feature of core α1-3/α1-6-difucosylation) (Figure 27.2). The functions of glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) can be investigated using genetic strategies in sea urchins, antisense morpholinos or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down gene expression have been the methods of choice, but these will likely be superseded by more precise gene editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) strategy or transcription activator–like effector (TALE) nucleases (TALENs). A few echinoderm genomes have been sequenced (Echinobase), but as with most organisms, relating glycosylation activities to genes is not straightforward (Chapter 8).

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.27 Michael Pierce, Iain B.H. Wilson, Katharina Paschinger, and Pamela Stanley. This chapter discusses some general features of glycosylation and glycan-binding interactions in a few examples of species that belong to the deuterostome lineage, with particular emphasis on sea urchins, frogs, zebrafish, and mice. These organisms provide excellent models for studying the functions of glycans in development and physiology. Animal evolution split into two major lineages ∼500–600 million years ago—the deuterostomes and the protostomes (Chapter 20). The superphylum Deuterostomia contains the major phyla of Echinodermata (sea urchins and starfish), Hemichordata (acorn worms), Urochordata (ascidians), Cephalochordata (amphioxus), and Vertebrata (fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals). In deuterostomes, cell divisions of the zygote occur by radial cleavage, and cell fates are not precisely determined. Another characteristic feature is that the first opening to form in the blastula becomes the anus and the second opening becomes the mouth. The other superphylum, the Protostomia, contains the major phyla of Porifera (corals and sponges), Cnidara (anemones and hydra), Annelida (segmented worms), Mollusca (clams, oysters, snails, and slugs), and Arthropoda (insects, spiders, and crustacea). In protostomes, unlike deuterostomes, cell division during early development occurs in a highly organized manner and cell fate is precisely determined. Examples of well-studied protostome model organisms include the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25) and the arthropod Drosophila melanogaster (Chapter 26). Deuterostomes have been extensively studied because of their relatedness to humans and because they provide excellent model systems for understanding vertebrate biology. Sea urchins, frogs, zebrafish, and mice have received the most attention and each provides certain advantages for studying functions of glycans in reproduction, early development, or adult physiology. In numerous instances, these models have revealed aspects of glycobiology that were later confirmed in more evolutionarily distant organisms, and they often serve as excellent models for understanding human disease. Challenges exist, however, in describing the glycomes of the more ancient deuterostomes, mainly because of poor genome annotation, ignorance of individual glycosyltransferase substrates, and the presence of glycans with unusual structures. Each of these models is briefly described below with references to other sections of the book for additional details. Sea urchin glycans involved in fertilization have been studied extensively. In fact, much of what we know about the biochemistry of fertilization was first discovered in this organism (Figure 27.1), and the information subsequently applied to mammalian sperm–egg interactions. One of the advantages of studying fertilization in sea urchins is that eggs and sperm are easy to obtain in large quantities. Because fertilization occurs outside the adult body, it is also easy to experimentally manipulate sperm and eggs. (Top left) The purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.

 'Homologs of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs) initiating synthesis of mucin-type O-GalNAc, the most common O-glycan class in vertebrates, have been found throughout the animal kingdom (Chapter 10). Multiple ppGalNAcTs with different polypeptide substrate specificity work in metazoans. The common Core-1 Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr structure of vertebrates exists in insects, where it also forms part of a mucin-like protective layer in the gut. Heavily O-glycosylated gel-forming mucins have been recruited and diversified in metazoans to mediate lubrication and protection of hydrated epithelia in direct contact with the environment. O-Glycosylation of mucin-like domains is also common among protists, in which the glycans are usually initiated by ppGlcNAcTs—evolutionary precursors of the ppGalNAcTs. O-Linked mannose represents another example of Ser/Thr glycosylation that is conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals. O-Mannosylation plays diverse functions, supporting cell structural stability, facilitating protein folding, and affecting cell adhesion. In vertebrates, O-mannosylation is mediated by several families of glycosyltransferases, including distantly related protein O-mannosyltransferases (POMT1-2) and transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat containing proteins (TMTC1-4). These enzymes evolved to recognize distinct substrates, including unstructured regions (POMTs) and specific protein folds, such as cadherin domains (TMTCs). On α-dystroglycan, POMTs initiate the biosynthesis of the matriglycan, one of the most elaborate and highly specialized vertebrate glycans that connects muscles with the extracellular matrix (Chapters 13, 27, 45). In contrast, plants do not appear to have O-GalNAc and O-mannose. Instead, they express arabinose O-linked to hydroxyproline and galactose O-linked to serine and threonine (Chapter 24). Far less is known about O-glycosylation in prokaryotes, although O-glycans, such as O-mannose and novel Galβ1-O-Tyr modifications, can be found in bacteria (Chapter 21). Glucosylceramide is found in both plants and animals (Chapter 11). However, the most common core structure of vertebrate glycosphingolipids (Galβ1-4Glc-Cer) is varied in other organisms (e.g., Manβ1-4Glc-Cer and GlcNAcβ1-4Glc-Cer in certain invertebrates). Another variation is inositol-1-O-phosphorylceramide (e.g., mannosyldiinositolphosphorylceramide, the most abundant sphingolipid of yeast) and GlcNAcα1-4GlcAα1-2-myo-inositol-1-O-phosphorylceramide, found in tobacco leaves. Galactosylceramide and its derivatives seem to be limited to the nervous system of the deuterostome lineage of animals. In contrast, protostome nerves contain mainly glucosylceramides. An evolutionary trend is suggested: A transition from gluco- to galactoceramides corresponds with changes in the nervous system from loosely structured to highly structured myelin. Regarding complex gangliosides of the deuterostome nervous system, some general trends are seen in comparing reptiles and fish to mammals: an increase in sialic acid content, a decrease in complexity, and a decrease in “alkali-labile” gangliosides (bearing O-acetylated sialic acids). The lower the temperature, the more polar the composition of brain gangliosides; poikilothermic (cold-blooded) animals tend to express many polysialylated gangliosides in the brain. Heparan and chondroitin sulfate are found in many animal taxa, including insects (Chapter 26) and in mollusks.'
 'Glycans are critical components of many antigens and may determine how epitopes are presented (e.g., presentation of glycolipid antigens by CD1a-positive lymphocytes and other antigen-presenting cells). Sialylated N-glycans in the IgG Fc domain play critical roles in antibody effector functions, and modulation of fucosylation and/or N-glycan display at Asn297 of human IgG regulates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation. Hyaluronan has a critical role in heart development (Chapter 16), and glycosaminoglycans modulate angiogenesis, in part because they bind growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (Chapter 17). The structural integrity of the walls of blood vessels is thought to depend on glycans, including a high density of sialic acids at the luminal surface of endothelial cells, as well as glycosaminoglycans within the basement membrane underlying endothelial cells. Cardiac muscle integrity and optimal cardiovascular function depend on various glycans. The luminal surface of epithelial cells in the upper and lower airways are covered by a dense and complex array of mostly O-glycosylated mucins (Chapter 10) secreted by goblet cells and submucosal glands. Structural glycoproteins, glycolipids, and secreted mucin molecules form barriers that maintain epithelial surface hydration and protect against physical and microbial invasion. Embryonic stem cells lacking complex N-glycans cannot properly organize the bronchial epithelium. N-glycans are also important for healthy lung function, as mice lacking the core α1-6-linked fucose of N-glycans develop emphysema-like symptoms caused by overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the lung tissue; this may result from aberrant transforming growth factor-β1 signaling through its misglycosylated receptor. Gene knockouts of individual mucin polypeptides show overlapping functions. Mice lacking O-fucose glycans in the lung do not generate secretory cells necessary for airway integrity. O-GlcNAc on proteins of the nucleus and cytoplasm modulate insulin action, and aberrant O-GlcNAcylation is linked to hyperglycemia (Chapter 19). N-glycans may also play a role in type II diabetes, as mice that cannot synthesize triantennary N-glycans develop diabetes when fed a high-fat diet. This deficiency alters the single N-glycan on the GLUT2 glucose transporter on pancreatic islet cells, accelerating its endocytosis, leading to loss from the cell surface and poor response to insulin. N-glycans may also be important for the production of functional thyroid hormones (e.g., targeting of endocytosed thyroglobulin to lysosomes for conversion to T3 and T4 in the thyroid gland; Chapter 33). The plasma half-life of several pituitary glycoprotein hormones is regulated by the presence of N-glycans that contain an unusual sulfated GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 31), which controls hormone clearance in the liver. O-GalNAc glycosylation can regulate peptide hormones by affecting proteolytic cleavage, as exemplified by O-glycan loss in the phosphate regulating hormone FGF23 causing familial tumoral calcinosis in patients deficient in GalNAc-T3 (Chapter 10). Glycosaminoglycans (Chapters 16 and 17) are required for normal development, organization, and structure of both the gums and teeth. Oral commensal organisms interact with each other or the host epithelium using glycan recognition. Salivary gland–generated mucins help protect the oral cavity by preventing bacterial biofilm formation on teeth (Chapters 10 and 42). However, mucin sialoglycans also provide binding sites for tooth cavity–facilitating bacteria. Glycans physically separate the luminal contents of the gut from the cells by organizing the mucin barrier that helps block pathogens. However, the microbiome of the GI tract also contains microbial symbionts that maintain a complex physiologic equilibrium.']","Genetic modifications that eliminate initial steps of major glycan synthetic pathways and of some monosaccharide biosynthetic pathways generally result in embryonic lethality, with one exception being deletion of individual genes needed for initiation of mucin O-GalNAc pathway, likely because of functional redundancy among the 20 different polypeptide:O-GalNAc transferases.","Genetic modifications that eliminate initial steps of major glycan synthetic pathways and of some monosaccharide biosynthetic pathways generally result in embryonic lethality, with one exception being deletion of individual genes needed for initiation of mucin O-GalNAc pathway, likely because of functional redundancy among the 20 different polypeptide:O-GalNAc transferases (Chapter 10).

"Complete the following paragraph: Certain strains of E. coli express pili that bind avidly to P-blood group–related glycosphingolipids in the bladder epithelium, leading to urinary tract infection. Pathogenic strains of Salmonella produce pili that facilitate adherence to human intestinal cell mucosa, thereby causing food poisoning and infectious diarrhea. In other cases, a surface-anchored protein (afimbrial adhesin) expressed by the bacteria represents a critical colonization factor (Figure 42.3B).","['Adhesion may be mediated through terminal sugars or internal carbohydrate motifs. In other cases, the bacteria express adhesins that bind matrix glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, or laminin) or mucin, mediating attachment to the mucosal surface. The specific carbohydrate ligands for bacterial attachment on the animal cell are often referred to as adhesin receptors, and they are quite diverse in nature. The tropism of individual bacteria for particular host tissues (e.g., skin vs. respiratory tract vs. gastrointestinal tract) is determined by specific combinations of adhesin–receptor pairs. Pili or fimbriae are assemblies of protein subunits that project from the bacterial surface in hair-like threads whose tips often adhere to host glycans (Figure 42.3A). Such pili are usually composed of a repeating structural subunit providing extension and a different “tip adhesin” responsible for binding. The structural proteins for pilus assembly are often encoded in a bacterial operon. Lateral mobility of pili structures in the bacterial membrane provides a Velcro-like binding effect to epithelial surfaces. Certain strains of E. coli express pili that bind avidly to P-blood group–related glycosphingolipids in the bladder epithelium, leading to urinary tract infection. Pathogenic strains of Salmonella produce pili that facilitate adherence to human intestinal cell mucosa, thereby causing food poisoning and infectious diarrhea. In other cases, a surface-anchored protein (afimbrial adhesin) expressed by the bacteria represents a critical colonization factor (Figure 42.3B). For example, the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis promotes strong attachment of the bacteria to the ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchi and trachea, triggering local inflammation and tissue injury that results in the “whooping cough” disease. FHA is a component of modern pertussis vaccines given in infancy and early childhood to block infection. Examples of mechanisms of bacterial adherence to host cell surfaces. (A) Pili or fimbriae are organelles that project from the cell surface. They are made up of a repeating structural subunit and a protein at their tip that mediates recognition of a specific (more...) Adhesins can be glycoproteins as well. In Pasteurellaceae and some H. influenzae strains adhesins are N-glucosylated by a cytoplasmic N-glucosylation system that is homologous to the cytoplasmic O-GlcNAc transferase of eukaryotes. Similarly, transfer of heptose residues by the dodecameric bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family of enzymes to autotransporter adhesins in several different Gram-negative pathogens is essential for the adhesion process. Glycan–lectin interactions play pivotal roles in enabling certain pathogens to penetrate or invade through epithelial barriers, whereupon they may disseminate into and through the bloodstream to produce deep-seated infections. Samonella Typhi causes typhoid fever in humans, a process that begins with intracellular invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The outer core oligosaccharide structure of the LPS is required for internalization into epithelial cells. Removal of a key terminal sugar residue on the outer core markedly reduces the efficiency of bacterial uptake. Once invasion has occurred, the secreted A2B5 typhoid toxin mediates illness by first binding preferentially to the sialic acid Neu5Ac, which is enriched in humans. Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), the cause of strep throat, as well as serious invasive infections, attaches to human pharyngeal and skin epithelial cells via interaction of its hyaluronan capsular polysaccharide with the host hyaluronan-binding protein CD44 (Chapter 16). This binding induces marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane ruffling and opening of intercellular junctions that allow tissue penetration by GAS through a paracellular route. Bacterial glycosyltransferases are also involved in the intracellular manipulation of host responses.'
 ""The envelope protein monomer is shown in ribbon form, displayed along its longitudinal axis and as an external side view. Note the alignment of positively (more...) Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity. Because the adhesins and the receptors often cluster in the plane of the membrane, the resulting combinatorial avidity can be great. An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips. The most well-characterized bacterial lectins include the mannose-specific type-1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding F-17 fimbriae, which are produced by different strains of Escherichia coli. Fimbriated bacteria express 100 to 400 of these appendages, which typically have a diameter of 5–7 nm and can extend hundreds of nanometers in length (Figure 37.3) Thus, pili extend well beyond the bacterial glycocalyx comprised of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharides (see Chapter 21). Escherichia coli express hundreds of pili, as indicated by the fine filaments extending from the bacterium. (Reprinted, with permission of Elsevier, from Sharon N. 2006.

Examination of a high-resolution, three-dimensional structure of FimH bound to mannose revealed that, although mannose exists as a mixture of α and β anomers in solution, only the former was found in the complex. Mannose binds FimH at a deep and negatively charged site of FimH (Figure 37.4). FimH has “catch-bond” properties, such that the binding strength of individual FimH adhesins is augmented by increasing the shear forces on surface-bound E. coli cells. This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells. Uroplakin Ia presents high levels of terminally exposed mannose residues that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers. The resulting bacterial aggregates are flushed out of the urinary tract. Mice lacking the gene encoding the Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein are considerably more susceptible to bladder colonization by type-1-fimbriated E. coli than normal mice.

Many of these have been described (examples in Table 37.2), wherein the specificity of lectin binding can help define the range of susceptible tissues in the host (i.e., the microbe's ecological niche). The columnar epithelium that lines the large intestine expresses receptors with Galα1–4Gal-Cer residues, whereas cells lining the small intestine do not. Thus, Bacterioides, Clostridium, E. coli, and Lactobacillus only colonize the large intestine under normal conditions. P-fimbriated E. coli and some toxins bind specifically to galabiose (Galα1–4Gal) and galabiose-containing oligosaccharides, most commonly as constituents of glycolipids. Binding can occur to either internal (i.e., when the disaccharide is capped by other sugars) or terminal nonreducing galabiose units.""

Binding can occur to either internal (i.e., when the disaccharide is capped by other sugars) or terminal nonreducing galabiose units. P-fimbriated E. coli adhere mainly to the upper part of the kidney, where galabiose is abundant. The fine specificity of bacterial surface lectins and their relationship to the animal tropism of the bacteria can be further illustrated by E. coli K99. The K99 strain binds to glycolipids that contain N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), in the form of Neu5Gcα2–3Galβ1–4Glc, but not to those that contain N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). These two sugars differ by a single hydroxyl group that is present only on Neu5Gc. Interestingly, Neu5Gc-containing receptors are expressed on the intestinal cells of newborn piglets, but disappear as the animals grow and develop. As Neu5Gc is not normally biosynthesized by humans, this may explain why E. coli K99 can cause often lethal diarrhea in piglets but not in adult pigs or humans. Examples of interactions of bacterial adhesins with glycans  A number of secreted bacterial toxins also bind glycans (Table 37.3). The toxin from Vibrio cholera (cholera toxin), which consists of A and B subunits in the ratio AB5, has been extensively studied. The crystal structure of cholera toxin shows that the carbohydrate-recognition domains are located at the base of the B subunits, which bind to the Galβ1–3GalNAc moiety of GM1 ganglioside (Chapter 11) receptors (Figure 37.5). On binding of the B subunits to membrane glycolipids, the AB5 complex is endocytosed to the Golgi apparatus and then undergoes retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The A1 and A2 chains are proteolytically cleaved on toxin secretion, but remain stably associated until arrival in the ER. There, the enzymatic A1 chain unfolds, dissociates from the A2-B5 complex, and retrotranslocates to the cytosol where it rapidly refolds, thereby avoiding degradation by the proteasome. Catalytically active A1 then ADP-ribosylates a regulatory homotrimeric G-protein to activate adenylyl cyclase, severely altering ion homeostasis of the infected cell.

There, the catalytic A1 chain of Shiga toxin inactivates ribosomes, and thus the essential process of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, by an N-glycosidic cleavage event that depurinates 28S rRNA.

 'At environmental temperatures (∼21°C), Y. pestis, which lacks O-antigens, predominantly expresses a more immunostimulatory hexa-acylated lipid A, whereas at mammalian body temperature (37°C), the pathogen expresses a less immunostimulatory tetra-acylated lipid A. These data suggest that the production of a less immunostimulatory form of LPS on entry into a mammalian host might confer avoidance to immune detection. Sialic acids and related nonulosonic acids are also synthesized de novo or scavenged from the host for incorporation into the LOS of several Gram-negative pathogens, including pathogenic members of the genera Haemophilus, Neisseria, Campylobacter, and Vibrio. This can be accomplished by several distinct mechanisms and often confers properties of immune evasive and enhanced virulence. For example, the human-specific pathogen N. gonorrhoeae uses a surface sialyltransferase and scavenges the activated form of sialic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) from the host. Such incorporation thwarts multiple arms of the host complement system and confers resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPS). An Achilles’ heel of this increasingly drug-resistant pathogen may be the promiscuity of its sialyltransferase toward related nonulosonic acids. Unnatural incorporation of legionaminic acid (CMP-Leg5,7Ac2) in N. gonorrhoeae prevents the immune evasion benefits typically afforded by Neu5Ac; moreover, vaginal administration of CMP-Leg5,7Ac2 leads to more rapid bacterial clearance of genital infections in mice. Studies of another Gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, underscore that the presence of legionaminic acid in LOS may not always be a deterrence to virulence. V. vulnificus is normally present in environmental (aquatic) ecosystems and is pathogenic in humans only during accidental contact with susceptible individuals, often following consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. Although it is a rare human pathogen, the bacterium can cause bloodstream and disseminated infections that are commonly fatal when they strike. Legionaminic acid contributes to the ability of V. vulnificus to survive in bloodstream and cause disseminated infection following intravenous administration. Occasionally, the host mounts an (auto)immune response to “self” antigens, including sialylated LOS. For example, the foodborne pathogen, C. jejuni, is capable of expressing a variety of sialylated LOS structures that mimic human gangliosides (Chapters 11 and 46). Sialylation of C. jejuni LOS results in CD14-dependent amplification of mucosal dendritic cell (DC) responses, which promote B-cell proliferation in a T-cell-independent manner. These events may help explain why in a small subset of infections, self-reacting (autoimmune) antibodies are inappropriately produced by B cells, leading to the attack of nerve fibers expressing the relevant gangliosides. These events can result in a life-threatening paralytic disorder known as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). For most patients, GBS symptoms have to be managed by removing cross-reactive antibodies (plasmapheresis) or immunomodulatory therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Adherence to skin or mucosal surfaces is a fundamental characteristic of the normal human microbiome and also an essential first step in the pathogenesis of many important infectious diseases (Chapter 34). Most microorganisms express more than one type of adherence factor or “adhesin” (Chapter 37). A large fraction of microbial adhesins are lectins that bind directly to cell-surface glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, or glycosaminoglycans. Adhesion may be mediated through terminal sugars or internal carbohydrate motifs. In other cases, the bacteria express adhesins that bind matrix glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, or laminin) or mucin, mediating attachment to the mucosal surface. The specific carbohydrate ligands for bacterial attachment on the animal cell are often referred to as adhesin receptors, and they are quite diverse in nature. The tropism of individual bacteria for particular host tissues (e.g., skin vs. respiratory tract vs.'
 ""These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage. H. pylori also expresses Lewis x–containing structures in the O-antigen of its LPS, which resemble Lewis x–modified glycans on the surface of parietal cells in the gastric lining.""]","For example, the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis promotes strong attachment of the bacteria to the ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchi and trachea, triggering local inflammation and tissue injury that results in the “whooping cough” disease.

Within the gut of the tsetse fly, the trypanosome replaces its entire VSG coat with acidic glycoproteins called procyclins (Figure 43.2). These GPI-anchored proteins form a dense glycocalyx and are composed of polyanionic polypeptide repeat domains projecting from the membrane. Unusual features are the presence of a single type of N-glycan (Man5GlcNAc2) and GPI anchors that are modified with branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine [Galβ1-4GlcNAc]n glycans. The terminal β-galactose can be substituted with α2-3-linked sialic acid by a parasitic trans-sialidase that transfers sialic acid from host glycoconjugates to the parasite surface. This sialylation protects the parasite in the insect intestine and can compromise the human immune system. Among parasites, genes encoding trans-sialidases have only been found in the protozoan genus Trypanosoma and occur in both T. brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. Interestingly, there is also evidence for trans-sialidase activities in some bacteria and in human serum, but these are far less well studied. T. cruzi, transmitted by reduviid bugs, is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, or South American trypanosomiasis. T. cruzi has a dense coat of glycosylinositolphospholipids (GIPLs) (Chapter 12) and mucins (Chapter 10) that project above the GIPL layer (Figure 43.3). The GIPLs contain the same basic structure as other GPI anchors, except that they are heavily substituted with Gal, GlcNAc, and host-derived sialic acid.

 ""Life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, a parasitic protozoan that causes the most severe form of malaria in humans. The bite of the female Anopheles mosquito introduces sporozoites into the human host, which mature as they travel to the liver and ultimately (more...) Following inoculation into the bloodstream, the sporozoite's major circumsporozoite protein (CSP) interacts with heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of hepatocytes, which allows invasion and the first replication in the mammalian host. Liver HS possesses an unusually high degree of sulfation compared to similar glycosaminoglycans from other organs, suggesting the basis for the selective targeting of Plasmodium to hepatocytes. A recombinant form of the pre-erythrocytic CSP made in yeast is a components of the RTS,S vaccine currently being implemented worldwide. Interestingly, the T-cell epitope of CSP is O-fucosylated, but the recombinant yeast-derived protein is not O-fucosylated. On exit from the liver, Plasmodium merozoites use multiple ligand–receptor interactions to invade host erythrocytes. The merozoite proteins, such as the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) proteins (Table 43.4), vary in their dependency on sialic acid residues on the erythrocyte surface and play an important role in erythrocyte invasion. Some major parasites and their glycan-binding proteins  The glycophorins are the major sialic acid–containing glycoproteins on erythrocytes. The EBL protein EBA-175 (erythrocyte-binding antigen-175) recognizes clusters of sialylated O-glycans attached to glycophorin A, particularly within a 30-amino-acid region that carries 11 O-glycans. Desialylation of erythrocytes precludes interactions of some strains of P. falciparum, and individuals lacking glycophorins A or B are refractory to invasion. Some strains of P. falciparum can reversibly switch from sialic acid–dependent to sialic acid–independent invasion, and this has important implications for vaccine design against malaria parasites. Pregnancy-associated malaria is a major cause of suffering and arises when P. falciparum–infected erythrocytes are sequestered in the placenta of pregnant women. The parasite expresses the VAR2CSA protein, which mediates adherence of the infected erythrocytes to placental chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) with very high specificity and affinity (Kd∼15 nm), promoting parasite infection and invasion. Eruption of the merozoites from infected erythrocytes releases free glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), which are prominent virulence factors contributing to malaria pathogenesis (Chapter 12). P. falciparum GPIs mimic host GPIs and activate host GPI-associated signaling pathways. The GPIs can activate host's macrophages, mainly through Toll-like receptor-2 signaling, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of cell-adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin in endothelial cells. Antibodies to these GPIs can neutralize their effects and mitigate the pathology of the disease independently of direct infection. In addition, the P. falciparum genome encodes a number of enzymes involved in N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation (O-fucosylation) and C-mannosylation. Whereas N-glycans are truncated and typically contain only a chitobiosyl core, GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ-Asn, mannose is abundantly present in GPI anchors. There is also evidence suggesting that Plasmodia may express a number of unusual glycoconjugates, such as galactose- and glucose-containing glycoproteins and glucose-containing glycolipids.

Parasitic protozoans and helminths (worms) synthesize glycans with structures often different from those typically found in vertebrates, and are thus often antigenic. Parasites also express glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) involved in host invasion and parasitism. As part of the disease process, parasite glycans can trigger the host's innate immune system, which can lead to the induction of adaptive immune responses. This chapter discusses the major roles of glycoconjugates in parasitic infections. Parasitism is a condition in which one organism (the parasite) in some way lives at the expense of the host. Parasites infect millions of people worldwide and cause much suffering and death, especially in underdeveloped countries (Table 43.1). Like other types of infections (e.g., bacterial or viral) (Chapter 42), parasite GBPs interact with host glycomes and parasite glycans interact with host GBPs and antibodies. Thus, research on parasite glycobiology and biochemistry could provide therapeutics for reducing disease morbidity and mortality. Moreover, studies on the molecular pathology of organisms, such as parasites that have evolved to deceive and compromise the host immune system, provide novel insights into the regulation of human innate and adaptive immune responses. Worldwide distributions of some major parasitic human diseases  The majority of parasitic diseases are divided into two categories: those caused by protists (single-celled organisms; Table 43.2) and those caused by helminths (worms/metazoans; Table 43.3). The major classes of protozoan parasites include Plasmodium (causing malaria), Entamoeba histolytica (causing amebiasis), Leishmania (causing leishmaniasis), and Trypanosoma (causing sleeping sickness and Chagas disease). Parasitic worms include trematodes (e.g., Schistosoma mansoni, causing schistosomiasis), nematodes (e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides) and cestodes or tapeworms (e.g., Taenia solium, causing taeniiasis). Worms are very large relative to host cells. Thus, most worms live in the extracellular spaces of their hosts, and have evolved a variety of infective and protective strategies. Glycoconjugates are important in both the life cycles and pathology of most major parasites. For example, many parasitic protozoans and helminths have elaborated intriguing mechanisms to target GBPs (Chapter 29) or glycans in the host to promote parasitism, and to evade host immune responses. Some of the major parasitic protozoans of humans  Some of the major parasitic helminths of mammals  Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, prominently Plasmodium falciparum in humans. Malarial parasites lead a complicated life cycle, alternating between a sexual reproduction stage in the female Anopheles mosquito vector and an asexual reproduction stage in mammalian tissues (hepatocytes and erythrocytes) and the bloodstream (Figure 43.1).

 'Other antigenic proteins, including several galectins, have been cloned from parasitic nematodes including Teladorsagia circumcincta. Sporozoites from Cryptosporidium parvum, an opportunistic protozoan that infects individuals with compromised immunity, have hemagglutinating activity, and a lectin on the parasite surface may play a crucial role in host-cell attachment. Recently, a sialic acid–binding protein in Toxoplasma gondii has been identified (SABP1) that is important for infection by this protozoan. In addition, the glycan antigens of many parasites are being characterized in an effort to develop vaccines and new diagnostics for the diseases they cause. For example, synthetic glycoconjugates based on glycan structural components of P. falciparum GPI to create a malaria vaccine and the T. cruzi cell surface mucins that are being utilized to develop serological assays to improve Chagas disease diagnostics, and the detection by lateral flow assay of secretory glycan antigens of Schistosoma in urine or blood allows sensitive diagnosis of active infections in the field.

Schematic representation of the major surface glycoconjugates of Trypanosoma cruzi. The cell surface of T. cruzi is covered with a dense layer of mucins, with extensive O-glycosylation, glycosylinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), and lipopeptidophosphoglycan (more...) T. cruzi also express lipopeptidophosphoglycan (LPPG), the major surface glycan of the insect stage of the parasite (Figure 43.3). Depending on the life-cycle stage, LPPG is composed of an inositolphosphoceramide-anchored glycan or an alkylacylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycan that includes nonacetylated glucosamine, mannose, galactofuranose, and 2-aminoethylphosphonate (2-AEP). The lack of ceramide anchors and galactofuranose in mammalian cells suggests potential targets for the development of chemotherapeutic agents. Leishmania causes different forms of leishmaniasis, which manifest clinically in three forms: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral, the latter being fatal if untreated. Leishmania parasites have a remarkable capacity to avoid destruction in the hostile environments they encounter during their life cycle, alternating between intracellular macrophage parasitism and extracellular life in the gut of their sandfly vector (Figure 43.4). Life cycle of Leishmania species, the parasitic protozoan that causes leishmaniasis in humans.  Stage-specific adhesion is mediated by structural variation of the abundant cell-surface glycoconjugate lipophosphoglycan (LPG), which contributes to parasite survival in the hydrolytic midgut (Figure 43.5). The basic LPG structure in all Leishmania species consists of a 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-phosphatidyl(myo)inositol lipid anchor, a heptasaccharide core, a long phosphoglycan (PG) polymer composed of (-6Galβ1-4Manα 1-PO4-) repeat units, and a small oligosaccharide cap. In many species, the PG repeats contain additional substitutions that mediate key roles in stage-specific adhesion. For example, in Leishmania major, the PG repeats bear β1-3-galactosyl side-chain modifications, which provide a binding site for the sandfly midgut galectin, PpGalec. As parasites differentiate in the sandfly from amastigotes into procyclic promastigotes, and finally to infective metacyclic stages, the β1-3 Gal-modified PGs are capped by α1-2 arabinosyl residues, giving rise to a structure that does not bind to PpGalec and thus facilitating detachment of the parasite from the sandfly midgut. LPG is highly abundant on the parasite surface, suggesting a central role for the glycoconjugate in the parasite's infectious cycle, as well as allowing the parasite to establish successful infections in the mammalian host. In addition, galectin-3 in the vertebrate host may recognize some of the L. major glycans as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, facilitating leukocyte responses to infection.

However, these proteins would also shield incoming membranes from degradation if vesicle fusion simply occurred.","[""Sugars that lie too close to the lipid bilayer apparently give limited access to soluble lysosomal enzymes, and additional proteins called saposins are required to present the substrates to the enzymes. Saposins (SAPs), also called “liftases,” form complexes with multiple degradative enzymes for more efficient hydrolysis of short glycolipids close to the membrane. SAPs are derived from a 524-amino-acid precursor called prosaposin, which is processed into four homologous activator proteins each comprising ∼80 amino acids: saposins A, B, C, and D. Despite their homology, each saposin has different properties. SAP-A and SAP-C help β-galactosyl- and β-glucosylceramidase degradation, respectively. SAP-B assists arylsulfatase A, α-galactosidase, sialidase, and β-galactosidase. The activation mechanism of SAPs is thought to be similar to that of the GM2 activator described below. SAP-D and SAP-B also assist in sphingomyelin degradation by sphingomyelinase. Complete absence of prosaposin is lethal in humans, and deficiencies in SAP-B and SAP-C lead to defects that clinically resemble arylsulfatase A deficiency (metachromatic leukodystrophy) and Gaucher's disease. These symptoms might be predicted based on the enzymes that these saposins assist. GM2 activator protein forms a complex with either GM2 or GA2 and presents them to β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A for cleavage of β-GalNAc. The activator protein binds a molecule of glycolipid, forming a soluble complex, which can be cleaved by the hexosaminidase. The resulting product is then inserted back into the membrane, and the activator presents the next GM2 molecule, and so on. Genetic loss of this activator protein causes the accumulation of GM2 and GA2, resulting in the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. Endocytic vesicles deliver membrane components to the lysosome for degradation and are often seen as intralysosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs). They appear like vesicles within the lysosome and are especially prominent in patients with glycolipid storage disorders. How do “vesicles within vesicles” form and what is their function? The internal surface of the lysosomal membrane has a thick, degradation-resistant glycocalyx of integral and peripheral membrane proteins decorated with poly-N-acetyllactosamines, which protect the lysosomal membrane against destruction. However, these proteins would also shield incoming membranes from degradation if vesicle fusion simply occurred. By creating multiple internal membranes seen in typical MVBs, the target molecules are exposed to the soluble lysosomal enzymes, and digestion proceeds efficiently on the membrane surfaces of these internal vesicles. MVB formation starts with inward budding of the limiting endosomal membrane. Lipids and proteins are sorted to either the internal or the limiting membrane. Ubiquitination of cargo proteins targets them to internal vesicles of MVBs, but ubiquitin-independent routes also exist. Intra-endosomal membranes and limiting endosomal membrane have different lipid and protein compositions. Membrane segregation and lipid sorting prepare the internal membranes for lysosomal degradation. During maturation of the internal membranes, cholesterol is continually stripped away (to <1%) and a negatively charged lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) increases up to 45%. This molecule is highly resistant to phospholipases. BMP also stimulates sphingolipid degradation on the inner membranes of acidic compartments. Because BMP is not present in the lysosomal outer membrane, the unique lipid profile ensures that degradation by hydrolases and membrane-disrupting SAPs occurs without digesting the lysosomal outer membrane. Degradation of glycans is not always complete. Partially degraded or incomplete glycans on glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycosphingolipids can be internalized within a functional Golgi compartment containing sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases and then elongated. In the case of glycosphingolipids, this pathway makes a substantial contribution to total cellular synthesis, but in glycoproteins it probably makes a relatively small contribution.""
 'Degradation of glycans is not always complete. Partially degraded or incomplete glycans on glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycosphingolipids can be internalized within a functional Golgi compartment containing sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases and then elongated. In the case of glycosphingolipids, this pathway makes a substantial contribution to total cellular synthesis, but in glycoproteins it probably makes a relatively small contribution. These processes can be salvage and repair mechanisms or may play an integral part in an unidentified physiological pathway. The half-life of certain membrane proteins is longer than the half-life of their sugar chains. Terminal monosaccharides turn over faster than those near the reducing end of the glycan, suggesting that terminal sugars are removed by exoglycosidases. Cleavage may occur at the cell surface or when proteins are endocytosed in the course of normal membrane recycling. Because the mildly acidic late endosomes contain lysosomal enzymes with a fairly broad pH range, terminal sugars such as sialic acid can be cleaved. If the endocytosed proteins are not degraded in lysosomes, the proteins may reencounter sialyltransferases in the Golgi, become resialylated, and appear again on the cell surface. A similar situation may occur if a protein has lost both sialic acid and galactose residues from its glycans. Some membrane proteins synthesized in the presence of oligosaccharide processing inhibitors can still reach the cell surface in an unprocessed form. Subsequent incubation in the absence of inhibitors leads to normal processing over time. The extent of processing and the kinetics depend on the protein and the cell type. Because Golgi enzymes are not distributed identically in all cells, the extent of reprocessing is variable. Most studies have monitored N-glycans, but membrane proteins with O-glycans probably behave similarly. The majority of the newly synthesized glucosylceramide arrives at the cell surface by a Golgi-independent cytoplasmic pathway. Some of this material, as well as glucosylceramide generated by partial degradation of complex glycosphingolipids, can recycle to the Golgi. There, like glycoproteins, simple glycosphingolipids can serve as acceptors for the synthesis of longer sugar chains. In the lysosome, sphingosine is produced by complete degradation of glycosphingolipids and reused. Together, these pathways, especially the latter, may account for the majority of complex glycolipid synthesis in many cells. Depending on the physiological state of the cell and synthetic demands, the de novo pathway starting from serine and palmitoyl CoA may account for only 20%–30% of the total synthesis. Shuttling the recycled components through and among the various organelles appears to involve vimentin intermediate filaments. Mechanisms and details of this process are presently lacking. Monosaccharide salvage is discussed in Chapter 5. Monosaccharides derived from glycan degradation are transported back into the cytoplasm using transporters specific for neutral sugars, N-acetylated hexoses, anionic sugars, sialic acid, and glucuronic acid. Turnover of glycans is high and the salvage of sugars can be quite substantial. There have been few studies comparing the actual contributions of exogenous monosaccharides, those salvaged from glycan turnover, and those generated from de novo synthesis. Cells probably differ in their preference for each source of monosaccharides. These differences may explain why monosaccharide therapy used to treat some glycosylation disorders is effective in certain cells and not others. Lysosomal degradation of glycans can be blocked by raising the intralysosomal pH, by inactivating a particular glycosidase, by mutation, or by protein-specific inhibitors. Lysosomal enzymes usually have acidic pH optima, and adding ammonium chloride or chloroquine slows degradation by increasing the intralysosomal pH. However, some lysosomal enzymes have relatively broad pH optima, higher than the lysosome. Some active “lysosomal” enzymes can be found in early and late endosomes, which have a higher pH than lysosomes.'

Lysosomes are intracellular membrane-bound organelles that turn over and degrade many types of macromolecules, via the action of lysosomal enzymes (also called acid hydrolases because of the low-pH characteristic of lysosomes). These enzymes are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on membrane-bound ribosomes and traverse the ER–Golgi pathway along with other newly synthesized proteins. At the terminal Golgi compartment, they are segregated from other glycoproteins and selectively delivered to lysosomes. In most “higher” animal cells, this specialized trafficking is achieved primarily through the recognition of N-glycans containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) by “P-type” lectins. As the first clear-cut example of a biological role for glycans on mammalian glycoproteins and the first shown link between glycoprotein biosynthesis and human disease, the interesting history of its discovery is described in some detail. More recent data on other proteins with “P-type” lectin domains are also mentioned. Early studies of human genetic “storage disorders” by Elizabeth Neufeld indicated a failure to degrade cellular components, which therefore accumulated in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Soluble corrective factors from normal cells could reverse these defects when added to the culture media. These factors were later identified as lysosomal enzymes that were found to be deficient in patients with storage disorders. These enzymes, secreted in small quantities by normal cells in culture, or by cells from patients with a different “complementary” defect (Figure 33.1), existed in two forms: a “high-uptake” form, recognized by saturable, high-affinity receptors that could correct the defect in deficient cells, and an inactive “low-uptake” form that could not correct. Cross-correction of lysosomal enzyme deficiencies in cultured cells. Small amounts of high-uptake lysosomal enzymes secreted by normal fibroblasts (thin arrows) were taken up by fibroblasts from a patient with a genetic lack of a single lysosomal enzyme, (more...) Fibroblasts from patients with a rare genetic disease showing prominent inclusion bodies in cultured cells (therefore termed “I-cell” disease) were found to be deficient in almost all lysosomal enzymes. Interestingly, all these enzymes are actually synthesized by I-cells, but are mostly secreted into the medium, instead of being retained in lysosomes. Neufeld showed that although I-cells incorporated the high-uptake enzymes secreted by normal cells, enzymes secreted by I-cells were not taken up by other cells (Figure 33.1). She therefore proposed that I-cell disease results from a failure to add a common recognition marker to lysosomal enzymes. This marker was assumed to be responsible for the proper trafficking of newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes in normal cells. The “high-uptake” property was destroyed by strong periodate treatment, which oxidizes vicinal hydroxyl groups in glycans, predicting that the recognition marker was a glycan. High uptake of lysosomal enzymes was next found, by William Sly, to be blocked by M6P and its stereoisomer fructose 1-phosphate, but not by other sugar phosphates. Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis.'

Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans removed from misfolded, newly synthesized glycoproteins is covered in Chapters 39 and 45. Most glycans are degraded in lysosomes by highly ordered pathways using endo- and exoglycosidases, sometimes aided by noncatalytic proteins. Insights that unraveled these complex pathways emerged from studies of rare human genetic disorders called lysosomal storage diseases. In each disease, undigested molecules accumulate in lysosomes. Clever experiments combining enzymology with glycan structural analyses revealed the steps of the pathways and also unlocked the mechanisms of lysosomal enzyme targeting (Chapter 33). Lysosomes contain approximately 50 to 60 soluble hydrolases that degrade various macromolecules. Most of the glycan-degrading enzymes (endo- and exoglycosidases and sulfatases) have pH optima between 4 and 5.5, but a few have higher pH optima, nearing neutral. Exoglycosidases cleave the glycosidic linkage of terminal sugars from the nonreducing end of glycans (the outermost left end of glycans for figures in this book, e.g., Figure 44.1). Exoglycosidases recognize only one monosaccharide (rarely two) in a specific anomeric linkage and are much less particular about the structure of the molecule beyond that glycosidic linkage. This lack of specificity allows these enzymes to act on a broad range of substrates. However, exoglycosidases do not usually work unless all of the hydroxyl groups of the terminal sugar are unmodified. Acetate, sulfate, or phosphate groups usually have to be removed before action of the glycosidases. Esterases cleave acetyl groups and specific sulfatases remove the sulfate groups on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N- or O-linked glycans. Endoglycosidases cleave internal glycosidic linkages of larger chains. These enzymes are often more tolerant of modifications of the glycan; in some cases, they require a modified sugar for optimal cleavage. Degradation of complex-type N-glycans. The lysosomal degradation pathway of glycoproteins carrying complex-type glycans proceeds simultaneously on both the protein and glycan moieties. The N-glycans are sequentially degraded by the indicated exoglycosidases (more...) Even though the lysosomal glycosidases perform similar reactions, their amino acid sequences are only ∼15%–20% identical to each other. Thus, there are no highly conserved glycosidase catalytic domains. Lysosomal enzymes are all N-glycosylated, and most are targeted to the lysosome by the mannose 6-phosphate pathway (Chapter 33), share aspects of the recognition marker for assembly of mannose 6-phosphate on N-linked glycans, and have affinity for mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The concentration of enzymes within the lysosome is difficult to determine. Proteinases such as cathepsins are estimated to be ∼1 mm; glycosidases are probably present at much lower concentrations. About 50 known inherited diseases impair lysosomal degradation of macromolecules. Although each one is rare, together their occurrence is about one in every 5000 to 10,000 births. Loss of a single lysosomal hydrolase leads to the accumulation of its substrate as undegraded fragments in tissues and the appearance of related fragments in urine. Many of the human disorders have animal models.'
 'Lysosomal sialidase (neuraminidase), β-galactosidase, and a serine carboxypeptidase called protective protein/cathepsin A form a complex in the lysosome that is required for efficient degradation of sialylated glycoconjugates. Cathepsin A protects β-galactosidase from rapid degradation and also activates the sialidase precursor, but the protection does not depend on the catalytic activity of cathepsin A. Mutations in this protective protein lead to galactosialidosis in which the simultaneous deficiencies in β-galactosidase and sialidase are secondary effects of defective cathepsin A. Glycans that have GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc, GlcAβ1-3Gal, or Galα1-3Gal on the outer branches must first have these residues removed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, β-glucuronidase, and α-galactosidase, respectively, before any further digestion of the underlying oligosaccharide chains. Oligomannosyl N-glycans that enter the lysosome are hydrolyzed by an α-mannosidase to yield Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAc, a common intermediate of hybrid and complex-type N-glycan. A second α1-6-specific mannosidase can cleave this linkage in humans and rats, but only on molecules that have a single core region N-acetylglucosamine (i.e., those generated by chitobiase cleavage). Finally, β-mannosidase completes the degradation. Oligomannosyl N-glycans derived from dolichol-linked precursors or misfolded glycoproteins are handled differently (Chapter 39). Degradation of typical αGalNAc-initiated O-glycans has not been systematically studied. Many of the outer structures of N-glycans are also found on O-glycans (Chapter 14); therefore, degradation of these glycans probably uses the same group of exoglycosidases as discussed above. An exception to this is the linkage region, GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr. Patients with Schindler disease lack the α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase specific for αGalNAc and will not cleave αGlcNAc. This same enzyme probably removes terminal αGalNAc from blood group A–containing glycans (GalNAcα1-3Gal) and some glycolipids such as the Forssmann antigen (GalNAcα1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcβCer). Patients lacking α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase accumulate GalNAc-containing glycopeptides in their urine, but curiously they also accumulate more complex, extended glycopeptides containing N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid. The structures are the same as those found on some native glycoconjugates. Their production could result from a general slowdown of oligosaccharide degradation or may arise by reassembly of glycans on accumulated GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr glycopeptides. GAGs, including heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), DS, KS, and hyaluronan, are degraded in a highly ordered fashion. The first three are O-xylose-linked to core proteins (Chapter 17), KS is N- or O-linked, and hyaluronan is a free glycan (Chapter 16). Some proteoglycans are internalized from the cell surface and the protein portion is degraded. The GAG chains are then partially cleaved by enzymes such as endo-β-glucuronidases or endohexosaminidases that clip at a few specific sites. Endoglycosidase cleavage creates multiple terminal residues that can be degraded by unique or overlapping sets of sulfatases and exoglycosidases. Structural analyses of partially degraded fragments in the lysosomes of cells from patients with MPS revealed both the degradation pathways and genetic defects responsible (Table 44.2).']","To prevent shielding incoming membranes from degradation if vesicle fusion simply occurred, the creation of multiple internal membranes seen in typical multivesicular bodies (MVBs) exposes the target molecules to the soluble lysosomal enzymes, allowing for efficient digestion on the membrane surfaces of these internal vesicles.","By creating multiple internal membranes seen in typical MVBs, the target molecules are exposed to the soluble lysosomal enzymes, and digestion proceeds efficiently on the membrane surfaces of these internal vesicles. MVB formation starts with inward budding of the limiting endosomal membrane. Lipids and proteins are sorted to either the internal or the limiting membrane. Ubiquitination of cargo proteins targets them to internal vesicles of MVBs, but ubiquitin-independent routes also exist. Intra-endosomal membranes and limiting endosomal membrane have different lipid and protein compositions. Membrane segregation and lipid sorting prepare the internal membranes for lysosomal degradation. During maturation of the internal membranes, cholesterol is continually stripped away (to <1%) and a negatively charged lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) increases up to 45%. This molecule is highly resistant to phospholipases. BMP also stimulates sphingolipid degradation on the inner membranes of acidic compartments. Because BMP is not present in the lysosomal outer membrane, the unique lipid profile ensures that degradation by hydrolases and membrane-disrupting SAPs occurs without digesting the lysosomal outer membrane. Degradation of glycans is not always complete.",1.0,0.4988489649758744,0.793255615155402,0.013513513513513514,0.99999999998,0.0

This chapter discusses inherited human diseases that are caused by defects in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (congenital disorders of glycosylation, CDGs). Representative examples are described of genetic defects in the major glycan families and what lessons we can learn from them about glycobiology. Among genetic disorders of glycosylation, those caused by somatic mutations are described in Chapter 46. Disorders affecting the lysosomal degradation of glycans are described in Chapter 44. Although the term “congenital disorders” by definition include those caused by nongenetic, unfavorable in utero conditions, the term “congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)” is now widely used as an equivalent of inherited disorders of glycosylation. Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33) it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found. In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations. Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms. The test was positive in these children, thereby, for the first time, indicating a generic defect in protein N-glycosylation. Lacking further details about glycan structures and the underlying genetic variants, Jaeken decided to call these cases “carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes” (CDGS). Several years later, many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases. To keep the acronym “CDG,” those involved also decided to call them “congenital disorders of glycosylation,” rather than inherited genetic defects in glycosylation. Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis. A few disorders can be treated by the consumption of monosaccharides. The rapid growth in the number of discovered disorders, shown in Figure 45.1, has resulted in an evolution of disease nomenclature. Since 1999, CDGs were defined as genetic defects in N-glycosylation, but now the term is applied to any glycosylation defect. Nowadays, CDGs are categorized in four groups, comprising defects in N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and lipid and GPI-anchor glycosylation and defects that impact multiple glycosylation pathways. CDGs are named by the mutated gene followed by “-CDG” suffix (e.g., PMM2-CDG). Selected disorders are listed in Table 45.1 and all known disorders in Online Appendix 45A. Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification.'
 'CDGs are named by the mutated gene followed by “-CDG” suffix (e.g., PMM2-CDG). Selected disorders are listed in Table 45.1 and all known disorders in Online Appendix 45A. Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification. (For simplicity, disorders affecting multiple pathways are included in disorders (more...) Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans  The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation. The first were identified in the early 1980s based primarily on deficiencies in multiple plasma glycoproteins. The patients were also delayed in reaching growth and developmental milestones and had low muscle tone, incomplete brain development, visual problems, coagulation defects, and endocrine abnormalities. However, many of these symptoms are also seen in patients with other multisystemic genetic syndromes. CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation can be distinguished because they often have abnormal glycosylation of common liver-derived serum proteins containing disialylated, biantennary N-glycans. Serum transferrin is especially convenient because it has two N-glycosylation sites, each normally containing disialylated, biantennary N-glycans. Different glycoforms can be resolved by isoelectric focusing (IEF) or ion-exchange chromatography, but better accuracy and sensitivity is achieved by mass spectrometry (MS) of purified transferrin. This simple test alerts physicians to likely CDG patients without knowing the genetic or molecular basis of the disease. N-glycosylation defects may be divided into two types based on transferrin glycoforms. Type I (CDG-I) patients lack one or both N-glycans because of defects in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) or its transfer to proteins. Type II (CDG-II) patients have incomplete protein-bound glycans because of abnormal processing. The biosynthetic pathways and locations of N-glycan defects are shown in Figure 45.2. Congenital disorders of glycosylation in the N-glycosylation pathway. The figure shows individual steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, glycan transfer to protein, and N-glycan processing similar to Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4. The shuttling (more...) A complete absence of N-glycans is lethal. Therefore, known mutations mostly generate hypomorphic alleles encoding proteins with diminished activity. A deficiency in any of the steps required for the assembly of LLOs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (e.g., nucleotide sugar synthesis or sugar addition catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase) (Chapter 9) produces a structurally incomplete LLO. Because the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) prefers full-sized LLO glycans, this results in hypoglycosylation of multiple glycoproteins. This means that some N-glycan sites are not modified. In recent years, it has been shown that some intermediate LLO structures can also be transferred to proteins, although with much lower efficiency. For example, low amounts of an extended chitobiose glycan were identified in ALG1-CDG, which is deficient in the mannosyltransferase that adds mannose to the chitobiose core. Importantly, many deficiencies in LLO synthesis produce incomplete LLO intermediates. Most of the LLO assembly steps are not easy to assay, but LLO assembly is conserved from yeast to humans, and intermediates that accumulate in CDG patients often correspond to the intermediates seen in mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with known defects in LLO assembly. Some mutant mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells) have been shown to have similar defects (Chapter 49).'
 'The discovery of CDG defects associated with trafficking proteins showed that the abnormal glycosylation linked to these disorders could arise from alterations in Golgi homeostasis and not only from impairment of the enzymes and transporters needed for glycosylation (Figure 45.5). Among the first of these trafficking proteins identified are subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex has multiple roles in trafficking within the Golgi, including the tethering of COPI-coated vesicles and recycling of Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases. COG7-CDG (Table 45.1) was discovered first. Trafficking of multiple glycosyltransferases and nucleotide sugar transporters were disrupted in COG7-CDG. The mutation affects the synthesis of both N- and O-glycans and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Mutations have now been found in all COG subunits except COG3. Mammalian cells deficient in the different COG subunits also show various degrees of altered glycosylation. Golgi homeostasis defects. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are also caused by defects in proteins and transporters that control Golgi homeostasis. These CDGs include members of the vesicle tethering conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, (more...) An unusual disorder called HEMPAS (hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with positive acidified-serum test) leads to abnormal red cell shape and instability (hemolysis) caused by mutations in SEC23B, another intracellular trafficking protein that produces abnormal red blood cell glycans in several pathways. In addition to trafficking proteins, a number of mutations in Golgi-associated ion transporters and vacuolar H+-ATPase subunits have also been shown to disrupt multiple glycosylation pathways, presumably because of an increase in Golgi pH, decrease in metal ion-dependent glycosyltransferase activities, or a more general disruption in Golgi recycling. Mutations in two Golgi manganese transporters, TMEM165 and ZIP8 (SLC39A8), cause CDGs highlighting the role of manganese homeostasis in glycosylation. Expression of the same CDG mutation can have highly variable impacts, even among affected siblings. Explanations based on residual activity from hypomorphic alleles of these “simple Mendelian disorders” are neither simple nor generally satisfying. The variability is often attributed to “genetic background.” A knockout mutation may be lethal in one highly inbred mouse strain, but not in another because compensatory pathways exist in the latter. Dietary and environmental impacts are substantial as seen in MPI-CDG patients treated by oral mannose therapy. Multiple simultaneous or sequential environmental insults may impinge on borderline genetic insufficiencies to produce overt disease. A major question for future investigations is how CDG defects cause pathology. Addressing this challenge will require the implementation of analytical approaches like glycomics and glycoproteomics and of model systems that allow identification of sensitive pathways and glycoproteins in affected tissues. In an interesting twist, it is possible to have diseases caused by “excessive” glycosylation. For example, Marfan syndrome results from mutations in fibrillin1 (FBN1) and one of these creates an N-glycosylation site that disrupts multimeric assembly of FBN1. This may not be an isolated case. A survey of nearly 600 known pathological mutations in proteins traveling the ER–Golgi pathway showed that 13% of them create novel glycosylation sites. This is far greater than predicted by random missense mutations and may mean that hyperglycosylation leads to a new class of CDGs.

Ng and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Pamela Stanley, Yan Wang, Jennifer Kohler, and Ajit Varki.'
 'The pathophysiology underlying these symptoms is still unknown. Defects in dolichol biosynthesis present with more specific symptoms as outlined below in the section Defects in Multiple Glycosylation Pathways. Mutations in six of the OST subunits also cause a CDG. The OST is a complex of multiple subunits of which STT3 is the catalytic subunit that contains OST activity. Two different genes encode STT3—namely, STT3A and STT3B. They are part of two different OST complexes, one with STT3A for cotranslational glycosylation and one with STT3B for glycosylation of proteins that escape glycosylation via the STT3A complex. Patients with defects in either subunit present with the typical multisystem phenotype. Interestingly, transferrin glycosylation is dependent on the STT3A-containing OST complex and thus abnormal in STT3A-CDG, but normal in STT3B-CDG. STT3B dependent protein substrates, such as sex hormone binding globulin, show reduced glycosylation in STT3B-CDG specifically. The phenotype of MAGT1-CDG is very different, presenting as a primary immunodeficiency characterized by chronic infections with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Transferrin glycosylation is abnormal in MAGT1-CDG. MAGT1 is an oxidoreductase that is mostly associated with the STT3B-OST complex. It is required for glycosylation of protein sequences containing cysteine residues. Reduced expression on natural killer cells of the NKG2D protein that requires MAGT1 for glycosylation is proposed to contribute to the immunodeficiency against EBV infections. Golgi disorders (Figure 45.2) affect N-glycan processing and include defects in glycosyltransferases, nucleotide sugar transporters, vacuolar pH regulators, and multiple cytoplasmic proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery within the cell and maintain Golgi homeostasis. Most of these processes are required for multiple glycosylation pathways and are discussed below (see the section Defects in Multiple Glycosylation Pathways). In B4GALT1-CDG, glycans show a dramatic loss of both galactose (Gal) and sialic acid (Sia) from transferrin because of deficient β1-4 galactosyltransferase activity. Patients present with a relatively mild clinical course without neurological symptoms, which can be explained by the fact that related genes are expressed in different tissues, such as B4GALT2 in the brain. A similar glycan pattern occurs in the X-linked SLC35A2-CDG, because of loss of UDP-Gal transporter activity. Surprisingly, within a few years after birth, abnormal glycosylation becomes normal. This is probably caused by somatic mosaicism of cells carrying the mutated SLC35A2 gene along with unaffected cells and by selection against the affected cells. Patients suffer from a mainly neurological phenotype. Defects in the glycosyltransferase MGAT2 and glycosidase MAN1B1 also result in characteristic glycan abnormalities on transferrin and other proteins that are now used to diagnose patients, whereas FUT8-CDG shows normal glycosylation of transferrin but severe fucosylation defects on total serum proteins. These CDGs present with neurological symptoms and other multisystem features, whereas MAN1B1-CDG additionally gives rise to obesity. Early on, it was assumed that glycosylation disorders would mainly result from defects in glycan biosynthetic enzymes, but that perspective has changed. Discovery of defects in Golgi organization and homeostasis, in ER chaperones such as COSMC or EDEM, and in ER quality control (such as EDEM-3-CDG) have broadened the perspective. A new defect in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) continuum (Chapter 39) is caused by mutations in NGLY1, an enzyme that cleaves N-glycans from misfolded glycoproteins transported into the cytoplasm before their proteasomal degradation (Table 45.1).'
 'Interestingly, specific mutations in the GNE gene also give rise to a thrombocytopenia syndrome without the presence of neurological symptoms. The biological mechanism behind these differences is not yet understood. The catabolism of Sia is executed by neuraminate pyruvate lyase (NPL), the role of which was unknown in humans until the identification of a human genetic disease. Recessive mutations in NPL result in a phenotype of myopathy and cardiomyopathy, possibly indicating a role of Sia in (cardiac) muscle besides glycosylation. GDP-Fucose (Fuc) can be synthesized from GDP-Man or obtained via fucose salvage. In the salvage pathway, Fuc is converted into Fuc-1-P by fucose kinase and then to GDP-Fuc by GDP-Fuc pyrophosphorylase (Chapter 5). The contribution of the endogenous versus the salvage pathway in different cells and tissues is not yet known. A disease in the salvage pathway has been reported due to mutations in FCSK (fucose kinase), resulting in a severe neurological syndrome with encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability. Patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD-II or SLC35C1-CDG) have mutations in SLC35C1, encoding the GDP-Fuc transporter in the Golgi. Here, transferrin sialylation was normal, so this defect was not detected by the usual test, but some serum proteins and O-linked glycans on leukocyte surface proteins were deficient in Fuc. One leukocyte protein carries a selectin ligand glycan, sialyl-Lewis x, that mediates leukocyte rolling before extravasation of leukocytes from capillaries into tissues (Chapter 34). This defect greatly elevates circulating leukocytes and decreases leukocyte extravasation, so patients have frequent infections. A few patients responded to dietary fucose therapy. Sialyl-Lewis x reappeared on their leukocytes, and circulating neutrophils promptly returned to normal levels. Fucose supplements must increase the amount of GDP-Fuc enough to correct the defect. A mouse model of Fuc deficiency lacks de novo biosynthesis of GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man (Chapter 5). The mice die without Fuc supplements, but providing Fuc in the drinking water rapidly normalizes their elevated neutrophils. The treatment also corrects abnormal hematopoiesis resulting from disrupted O-Fuc-dependent Notch signaling. Numerous defects in the biosynthesis of dolichol, the primary lipid carrier for monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in glycosylation, have been identified. These disorders share many of the features of other CDGs, although some of the mutations are associated with more specific phenotypes. As an example, variants in DHDDS have been identified in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, and heterozygous variants in NUS1 have been found in patients with various neurological phenotypes. The NUS1 and DHDDS gene products are involved in the initial steps of dolichol synthesis. The two proteins form a complex with cis-prenyltransferase activity that catalyzes polyprenolpyrophosphate formation. SRD5A3 acts as a polyprenol reductase to form dolichol (Chapter 9). This dolichol is then phosphorylated by DOLK to make the activated lipid, dolichol-phosphate, on which both monosaccharide and oligosaccharide precursors are built. Although the primary functions of dolichol-linked sugars lie within the N-glycosylation pathway, Dol-P-Glc and Dol-P-Man are both integral for different O-glycosylation pathways, and Dol-P-Man is required for biosynthesis of GPI. Clinical symptoms of some of these defects, including muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with DPM1-3 and DOLK defects, have been associated with abnormal O-mannosylation of dystroglycan. The discovery of CDG defects associated with trafficking proteins showed that the abnormal glycosylation linked to these disorders could arise from alterations in Golgi homeostasis and not only from impairment of the enzymes and transporters needed for glycosylation (Figure 45.5). Among the first of these trafficking proteins identified are subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex.']","Many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases.

"Complete the following paragraph: Another alternative is optimized synthetic α-mannosides, which could treat and prevent UTIs. Many pathogens initiate infection by binding to host cell-surface glycans (Chapter 37). Variable expression of these glycans may explain an individual's susceptibility to infection.","['At environmental temperatures (∼21°C), Y. pestis, which lacks O-antigens, predominantly expresses a more immunostimulatory hexa-acylated lipid A, whereas at mammalian body temperature (37°C), the pathogen expresses a less immunostimulatory tetra-acylated lipid A. These data suggest that the production of a less immunostimulatory form of LPS on entry into a mammalian host might confer avoidance to immune detection. Sialic acids and related nonulosonic acids are also synthesized de novo or scavenged from the host for incorporation into the LOS of several Gram-negative pathogens, including pathogenic members of the genera Haemophilus, Neisseria, Campylobacter, and Vibrio. This can be accomplished by several distinct mechanisms and often confers properties of immune evasive and enhanced virulence. For example, the human-specific pathogen N. gonorrhoeae uses a surface sialyltransferase and scavenges the activated form of sialic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) from the host. Such incorporation thwarts multiple arms of the host complement system and confers resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPS). An Achilles’ heel of this increasingly drug-resistant pathogen may be the promiscuity of its sialyltransferase toward related nonulosonic acids. Unnatural incorporation of legionaminic acid (CMP-Leg5,7Ac2) in N. gonorrhoeae prevents the immune evasion benefits typically afforded by Neu5Ac; moreover, vaginal administration of CMP-Leg5,7Ac2 leads to more rapid bacterial clearance of genital infections in mice. Studies of another Gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, underscore that the presence of legionaminic acid in LOS may not always be a deterrence to virulence. V. vulnificus is normally present in environmental (aquatic) ecosystems and is pathogenic in humans only during accidental contact with susceptible individuals, often following consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. Although it is a rare human pathogen, the bacterium can cause bloodstream and disseminated infections that are commonly fatal when they strike. Legionaminic acid contributes to the ability of V. vulnificus to survive in bloodstream and cause disseminated infection following intravenous administration. Occasionally, the host mounts an (auto)immune response to “self” antigens, including sialylated LOS. For example, the foodborne pathogen, C. jejuni, is capable of expressing a variety of sialylated LOS structures that mimic human gangliosides (Chapters 11 and 46). Sialylation of C. jejuni LOS results in CD14-dependent amplification of mucosal dendritic cell (DC) responses, which promote B-cell proliferation in a T-cell-independent manner. These events may help explain why in a small subset of infections, self-reacting (autoimmune) antibodies are inappropriately produced by B cells, leading to the attack of nerve fibers expressing the relevant gangliosides. These events can result in a life-threatening paralytic disorder known as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). For most patients, GBS symptoms have to be managed by removing cross-reactive antibodies (plasmapheresis) or immunomodulatory therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Adherence to skin or mucosal surfaces is a fundamental characteristic of the normal human microbiome and also an essential first step in the pathogenesis of many important infectious diseases (Chapter 34). Most microorganisms express more than one type of adherence factor or “adhesin” (Chapter 37). A large fraction of microbial adhesins are lectins that bind directly to cell-surface glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, or glycosaminoglycans. Adhesion may be mediated through terminal sugars or internal carbohydrate motifs. In other cases, the bacteria express adhesins that bind matrix glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, or laminin) or mucin, mediating attachment to the mucosal surface. The specific carbohydrate ligands for bacterial attachment on the animal cell are often referred to as adhesin receptors, and they are quite diverse in nature. The tropism of individual bacteria for particular host tissues (e.g., skin vs. respiratory tract vs.'
 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D. Esko, Victor Nizet, and the late Nathan Sharon and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek and Ajit Varki.'
 ""Thus, it is thought that regions of the protein surface normally covered by the glycan are exposed in rheumatoid arthritis. Some studies suggest that the circulating mannose-binding protein recognizes the more mobile G0 N-glycan and activates complement directly. Rheumatoid arthritis patients also have increased circulating immune complexes consisting of antibody molecules (called rheumatoid factor) that recognize the Fc regions of other IgG molecules. However, the epitopes involved do not seem to be glycan-related. Another likely possibility is that the altered glycosylation changes interactions with Fc receptors. Glycans and their binding proteins are key to the pathogenicity of essentially all infectious diseases, and this topic is covered in greater detail in Chapters 37, 42, and 43. Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here. Many urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, which adhere to bladder epithelial cells via a mannose-binding lectin, FimH, located on the F-pilus of the bacterium. A simple and effective antibiotic-independent treatment and prevention for this very common infection is drinking D-mannose because it competes bacterial glycan binding to the urinary tract when it is excreted in the urine. Another alternative is optimized synthetic α-mannosides, which could treat and prevent UTIs. Many pathogens initiate infection by binding to host cell-surface glycans (Chapter 37). Variable expression of these glycans may explain an individual's susceptibility to infection. For example, some pathogenic strains of E. coli infect the urinary tract using a lectin that binds the P blood group antigens (Chapter 14), with P negative individuals being immune. The E. coli P fimbriae lectins are also involved in spreading bacterial infections from the kidney to the bloodstream. Binding of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, to its ACE2 receptor on host epithelial cells first involves its initial binding to neighboring HS glycosaminoglycan chains, which induces a conformational change to enhance binding to ACE2. Importantly, mutations that alter spike glycosylation sites (e.g., variant B.1.1.7 (N501Y)) impact infectivity. Some pathogenic microorganisms secrete sialidases (neuraminidases), which usually remain at the site of infection. However, in some severe cases (e.g., Clostridium perfringens–mediated gas gangrene), sialidases reach the plasma where they desialylate red cells, resulting in clearance and anemia. Measuring plasma sialidase may aid diagnosis and prognosis. Similarly, the action of viral (e.g., influenza and dengue) or bacterial (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) sialidases causes loss of platelet sialic acid and contributes to increased platelet clearance. Sialidase-producing S. pneumoniae can also cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, and selectively inhibiting sialidase could have therapeutic value. Paradoxically, the thrombocytopenia resulting from desialylation of platelets predisposes to bleeding but may serve to protect against sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when the kidney glomerulus fails to retain serum proteins during initial filtration of plasma, allowing these proteins to leak into the urine. The epithelial/endothelial mucin molecule called podocalyxin on the foot processes (pedicles) of glomerular podocytes helps maintain pore integrity and excludes proteins from the glomerular filtrate. Sialic acids on podocalyxin are critical for this function. Loss of sialic acid is seen in spontaneous minimal-change renal disease in children and in the nephrotic syndrome that follows some bacterial infections. Animal models seem to mimic this situation with proteinuria and renal failure developing in a dose-dependent manner after a single injection of V. cholerae sialidase, which correlated with loss of sialic acids from the glomerulus. This was accompanied by effacement of foot processes and the alteration of tight junctions between podocytes. The anionic charge returned to endothelial and epithelial sites within two days, but the foot process loss remained.""
 'Adhesion may be mediated through terminal sugars or internal carbohydrate motifs. In other cases, the bacteria express adhesins that bind matrix glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, or laminin) or mucin, mediating attachment to the mucosal surface. The specific carbohydrate ligands for bacterial attachment on the animal cell are often referred to as adhesin receptors, and they are quite diverse in nature. The tropism of individual bacteria for particular host tissues (e.g., skin vs. respiratory tract vs. gastrointestinal tract) is determined by specific combinations of adhesin–receptor pairs. Pili or fimbriae are assemblies of protein subunits that project from the bacterial surface in hair-like threads whose tips often adhere to host glycans (Figure 42.3A). Such pili are usually composed of a repeating structural subunit providing extension and a different “tip adhesin” responsible for binding. The structural proteins for pilus assembly are often encoded in a bacterial operon. Lateral mobility of pili structures in the bacterial membrane provides a Velcro-like binding effect to epithelial surfaces. Certain strains of E. coli express pili that bind avidly to P-blood group–related glycosphingolipids in the bladder epithelium, leading to urinary tract infection. Pathogenic strains of Salmonella produce pili that facilitate adherence to human intestinal cell mucosa, thereby causing food poisoning and infectious diarrhea. In other cases, a surface-anchored protein (afimbrial adhesin) expressed by the bacteria represents a critical colonization factor (Figure 42.3B). For example, the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis promotes strong attachment of the bacteria to the ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchi and trachea, triggering local inflammation and tissue injury that results in the “whooping cough” disease. FHA is a component of modern pertussis vaccines given in infancy and early childhood to block infection. Examples of mechanisms of bacterial adherence to host cell surfaces. (A) Pili or fimbriae are organelles that project from the cell surface. They are made up of a repeating structural subunit and a protein at their tip that mediates recognition of a specific (more...) Adhesins can be glycoproteins as well. In Pasteurellaceae and some H. influenzae strains adhesins are N-glucosylated by a cytoplasmic N-glucosylation system that is homologous to the cytoplasmic O-GlcNAc transferase of eukaryotes. Similarly, transfer of heptose residues by the dodecameric bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family of enzymes to autotransporter adhesins in several different Gram-negative pathogens is essential for the adhesion process. Glycan–lectin interactions play pivotal roles in enabling certain pathogens to penetrate or invade through epithelial barriers, whereupon they may disseminate into and through the bloodstream to produce deep-seated infections. Samonella Typhi causes typhoid fever in humans, a process that begins with intracellular invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The outer core oligosaccharide structure of the LPS is required for internalization into epithelial cells. Removal of a key terminal sugar residue on the outer core markedly reduces the efficiency of bacterial uptake. Once invasion has occurred, the secreted A2B5 typhoid toxin mediates illness by first binding preferentially to the sialic acid Neu5Ac, which is enriched in humans. Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), the cause of strep throat, as well as serious invasive infections, attaches to human pharyngeal and skin epithelial cells via interaction of its hyaluronan capsular polysaccharide with the host hyaluronan-binding protein CD44 (Chapter 16). This binding induces marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane ruffling and opening of intercellular junctions that allow tissue penetration by GAS through a paracellular route. Bacterial glycosyltransferases are also involved in the intracellular manipulation of host responses.'
 ""These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage. H. pylori also expresses Lewis x–containing structures in the O-antigen of its LPS, which resemble Lewis x–modified glycans on the surface of parietal cells in the gastric lining.""]","Some pathogens initiate infection by binding to host cell-surface glycans.

In other instances, STn accumulation results from overexpression of the sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC1 (Figure 47.2). The expression of Tn and STn can enhance tumorigenic and invasive properties, and promote immunosuppression. Loss of normal topology and polarization of epithelial cells in cancer results in secretion of mucins with truncated O-GalNAc glycans, such as sialyl-Tn (STn) and Tn, into the bloodstream. Tumor cells invading tissues and the bloodstream also present (more...) Sialylation is generally increased in tumor cells, both on N-glycans and O-glycans. N-glycan sialylation serves as a regulatory mechanism for multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, illustrated by activation of MET and RON receptors by α2-3Sia. Increased α2-6Sia on N-glycans, due to ST6GAL1 up-regulation in cancer cells, enhances integrin-mediated cell motility and protects cells against apoptosis induced by galectins, death receptor ligands, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Additionally, some receptor glycoproteins and their downstream signaling pathways are dysregulated by addition of SLex and sialyl-Lewis a (SLea) structures on either N- or O-glycans. Other functions for tumor cell Sias include binding to factor H to limit complement activation and modulation of tumor cell attachment to matrix, facilitating invasion and metastasis. As well, tumor cell Sias play a prominent role in suppressing antitumor immunity through engagement of inhibitory Siglecs (Chapter 35), which are Sia-recognizing receptors expressed primarily on immune cells. There can also be changes in Sia modifications in tumor cells. Sia 9-O-acetylation can be increased (e.g., 9-O-acetylated GD3 [Figure 47.3] in melanoma cells) or decreased (e.g., on the O-glycans of colon carcinomas). Some tumor cells express small amounts of de-N-acetyl (deNAc) gangliosides (Figure 47.3). O-Acetylation of gangliosides appears to protect tumor cells from apoptosis, and de-N-acetylgangliosides may activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

This Sia differs from the common human Sia, Neu5Ac, by addition of a single oxygen atom (Figure 47.3). Humans show variable levels of circulating antibodies against Neu5Gc-containing epitopes. The resulting weak immune response (termed “xenosialitis”) can promote tumor growth by enhancing chronic inflammation and angiogenesis. Given this selective advantage, it is not surprising that tumors are better at accumulating Neu5Gc in the face of an increased immune response. Because the primary dietary source of Neu5Gc is red meat, this may help explain the increased cancer risk associated with its consumption. SLex and SLea epitopes (Chapter 14) were first identified as tumor antigens on glycosphingolipids. Expression of these antigens by epithelial carcinomas correlates with metastatic potential in mice and with tumor progression, metastatic spread, and poor prognosis in humans. SLex and SLea epitopes on glycoprotein ligands are key recognition determinants of the selectins (Chapter 34).'
 'An as-yet-unexplained observation is the scarcity of Neu5Gc in the brains of all vertebrates studied to date, including those that have high Neu5Gc levels in other tissues. The evolutionary advantage of excluding Neu5Gc from this vital organ is unknown but may relate to selection pressure by unknown pathogens and/or selective roles of Neu5Ac in optimal brain development and function. Metabolic pathways of Neu5Ac in vertebrates are shown in Figure 15.4. Neu5Ac is derived by reaction of ManNAc-6-P with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The ManNAc-6-P is produced by a bifunctional enzyme, UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, coded by the GNE gene. Missense, recessive mutations in GNE cause hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) in humans (Chapter 45), and gene inactivation causes embryonic lethality in mice. Reaction of ManNAc-6-P with PEP yields Neu5Ac-9-P, which is then dephosphorylated by a specific phosphatase to release free Neu5Ac in the cytoplasm. The same pathway can use Man-6-P instead of ManNAc-6-P to generate Kdn. In contrast, Neu5Ac biosynthesis in prokaryotes involves direct reaction of ManNAc with PEP, a pathway that proceeds without a Neu5Ac-9-P intermediate. Many other bacteria synthesize 9-deoxy forms of NulOs using pathways bearing ancient homology to the Neu5Ac synthetic pathways. Notably, synthetic unnatural mannosamine derivatives can enter the Sia biosynthetic pathway in cells, allowing metabolic engineering of the cell surface with modified Sias (Chapter 56). Metabolism of N-acetylneuraminic acid in vertebrate cells. The schematic (left) represents the pathways and compartments of biosynthesis of Neu5Ac in vertebrates: biosynthesized in the cytosolic compartment, converted to activated CMP-Neu5Ac in the nucleus, (more...) The β-anomers of free Sias are converted to CMP-Sias by reactions with CTP, which occur in the nuclear compartment, for unknown reasons. The CMP-Sia products then return to the cytosol and transported into Golgi compartments by a CMP antiporter, which concentrates them in the Golgi lumen (Chapter 5). In contrast, prokaryotic CMP-Sias are synthesized in the cytoplasm and used without compartmentalization. In eukaryotes, cytosolic CMP-Sia feeds back to inhibit GNE. In a rare human disease called sialuria, dominant mutations in the allosteric site of GNE result in failed feedback regulation and overproduction of Sia. The linkage-specific STs mentioned earlier are type II membrane proteins in animals, with signals leading to their Golgi localization. Animal STs share amino acid sequence motifs (sialylmotifs) that include shared sites for CMP-Sia recognition (Chapters 6 and 8). In contrast, prokaryotic STs emerged independently by convergent evolution, do not have sialylmotifs, and some do not even share homology. In addition to the Sia linkage, several eukaryotic STs show strong preferences for glycolipids versus glycoproteins and/or the terminal saccharides and sequences. Modified Sias, such as Neu5Gc, O-acetylated species, and unnatural synthetic Sias can be used to form activated CMP-Sias, which can serve as donors for STs. Some mammalian STs transfer both Neu5Ac and Kdn, but others transfer only one or the other. All result in α-sialyl linkages. Furthermore, “trans-sialidases” of some pathogenic trypanosome species and some bacteria transfer Sias from one sialoside to form another (Chapter 43). Although trans-sialidases tend to be specific regarding the sialyl linkage they generate, they can be promiscuous toward the donor and acceptor glycans. Once CMP-Neu5Ac is converted to CMP-Neu5Gc in the cytosol, there is no known way to reverse the reaction, perhaps explaining the accumulation of diet-derived Neu5Gc in human tissues.'
 ""When the sialyltransferases (STs) responsible for polySia formation are genetically ablated in mice, some nerve progenitor cells adhere prematurely, become stuck in place and fail to reach their proper destination. In contrast to the above-mentioned “repulsive field effects,” polySia can also act an “attractive field,” binding and locally concentrating neurotrophic factors like BDNF and FGF2. Notably, human genetic and molecular evidence indicate that variations in polysialylation may be a factor in human psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia. PolySia is found less abundantly on a few other proteins, including another cell adhesion molecule (SynCAM 1), a peptide receptor (neuropilin-2), and on O-glycans of fish egg glycoproteins. It is also a key component of the capsular polysaccharides of certain pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli K1, K92; Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C). The linkages between Sia units in polySia chains vary in bacteria, including α2-8, α2-9, and alternating α2-8/α2-9. The α2-8-polySia in E. coli K1 is also called colominic acid, which can be O-acetylated at Sia C-7 or C-9. The α2-9-polySia in N. meningitidis serogroup C can also be O-acetylated at Sia C-7 or C-8. A bacteriophage that attacks polySia-expressing bacteria produces a highly specific endosialidase that only clips chains that are ≥8 residues long. This enzyme (Endo-N) and its inactivated form (which binds polySia) are powerful tools to study polySia functions. Neu5Gc is common in mammals including human's closest evolutionary relatives (bonobos and chimpanzees). However, it is not synthesized by humans, because of a fixed single-exon deletion mutation in the CMAH gene encoding a hydroxylase that converts CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc. Why did the human lineage lose Neu5Gc? Many pathogens use Sias to bind and infect vertebrates (Chapter 42), and some specifically target Neu5Gc. An organism recognizing Neu5Gc may have been the cause of initial selection of the CMAH null state. Subsequent development of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in CMAH-null females may have then reduced fertility with CMAH-positive males by killing their sperm, possibly serving to speciate the null population. Other lineage-specific losses of Neu5Gc expression may have occurred in a similar fashion. This is part of a broader consideration of Sias as both a pathogen target and a physiological regulator, a combination that apparently contributed to rapid evolution of both Sia expression patterns and Sia-binding proteins, especially of the Siglecs (Chapter 35). Despite CMAH inactivation in humans, traces of Neu5Gc are found in normal human tissues. This, as well as the presence of Neu5Gc in human tumor cells and tissues, apparently represents metabolic incorporation of Neu5Gc ingested from foods, particularly “red meats.” Most healthy humans have circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, raising the possibility that their subsequent interaction with metabolically incorporated Neu5Gc contributes to inflammation in diseases that correlate with red meat consumption, such as atherosclerosis and epithelial cancers, pathologies uncommon in Neu5Gc-positive primates. Other possible consequences of human Neu5Gc loss include resistance to some Neu5Gc-binding animal pathogens such as E. coli K99, and the emergence of Neu5Ac-preferring pathogens exclusive to human hosts such as the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the toxin from Salmonella Typhi. An as-yet-unexplained observation is the scarcity of Neu5Gc in the brains of all vertebrates studied to date, including those that have high Neu5Gc levels in other tissues. The evolutionary advantage of excluding Neu5Gc from this vital organ is unknown but may relate to selection pressure by unknown pathogens and/or selective roles of Neu5Ac in optimal brain development and function.""
 'The 3D structures of pathogen sialidases are used for drug development (Chapter 42). Sialidases vary in their substrate specificity from highly selective (e.g., the α2-3-specific sialidase SpNanB and SpNanC from Streptococcus pneumoniae) to broadly acting (e.g., the α2-3, α2-6, α2-8 sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and SpNanA from S. pneumoniae). The products of sialidases also differ with free Sias as the most common ones (e.g., released by SpNanA) whereas 2,7-anhydro-Sias (e.g., released by SpNanB) and 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-sialic acids (Sia2ens) (e.g., released by SpNanC) are less common. Interestingly, some pathogen sialidases have additional lectin (sugar-binding) domains that appear to direct the action of the enzymes to particular sites. Some Sia linkages resist release even by sialidases with broad specificity. A branched α2-3Sia on the brain ganglioside GM2 requires a special helper protein (GM2-activator) to facilitate its cleavage, and mutation of GM2-activator protein results in GM2 buildup in the brain (Chapter 44). O-Methylation and O-acetylation of Sias also can hinder or even prevent hydrolysis by sialidases, as is the case for 4-O-acetyl group. These properties are likely biologically significant, but have not been well investigated. Microbial sialidases and trans-sialidases (see also Chapter 43) can be powerful virulence factors that may promote cellular invasion, unmask potential binding sites, and modulate the immune system. Sias liberated by sialidases at mucosal sites also provide nutrients for some bacteria or provide access to underlying carbohydrates. Viral neuraminidases facilitate release and spreading of newly formed viruses, and specific viral neuraminidase inhibitors are widely used as the antiviral drugs such as anti-influenza A virus drugs Relenza and Tamiflu (Chapter 42). Once a free Sia molecule is released in the lysosome of a vertebrate cell, it is returned to the cytosol by a specific exporter (SLC17A5, also called Sialin), in which it is either reused or degraded. Human mutations in Sialin cause Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disease, resulting in accumulation of Sia in lysosomes and excretion of excess Sia in the urine. Some pathogens scavenge Sias from the extracellular space, using high-efficiency transporters to concentrate them from trace levels. In contrast, there is no evidence for plasma membrane Sia transporters in eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, free Sias can be taken up into mammalian cells via fluid-phase macropinocytosis, eventually arriving in the lysosomes, from which they are exported into the cytoplasm by Sialin. Intact sialoglycans can also be taken up and transported to lysosomes, where sialidases release Sias for delivery to the cytoplasm and then to the nucleus to be reused by the cellular CMP-Sia synthetase. However, at the whole-body level, free Sias in the bloodstream derived from cellular sources or digestive processes are rapidly excreted in the urine. Thus, uptake of sialoglycoproteins (followed by lysosomal release by NEU1 and export by Sialin) may better account for the incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc in human tissues. In vertebrates, O-acetylated Sias are de-O-acetylated by Sia-specific O-acetylesterases, including the human enzyme coded by the SIAE gene, which may regulate B-cell development and immune tolerance by modulating recognition by Siglecs (Chapter 35). Enzymes with Sia 9-O-acetylesterase activity are also found in some bacteria and viruses.'
 ""A useful conceptualization of the sialome is as a “forest canopy” of the cell-surface glycan “forest” (the whole glycome) (Figure 15.3). At the outermost level are different Sia structures (leaves and flowers), which are in glycosidic linkage to underlying linear and branched oligosaccharides (stems and branches) (see Figures 15.2 and 15.3), which in turn are components of glycoproteins and glycolipids (the tree trunks). At the cell surface, glycolipids and glycoproteins organize into lateral domains (forests). Just as the forest varies greatly from place to place, the sialome varies among cell types and among domains on a given cell surface, variations that serve specific functions. As with the glycome, each cell type in each species expresses its own distinct sialome. For example, although mammalian liver sialoglycans are most abundant on glycoproteins, brain sialoglycans are much more abundant as sialoglycolipids (Chapter 11), so much so that they are termed “gangliosides” for the nerve ganglia on which they were discovered. The sialome also varies markedly in response to environmental cues. Sias can also exist as internally linked structures rather than on termini of glycans. In vertebrates, the terminal Sia of a glycan chain is rarely extended further, except with another Sia (Figure 15.3). Among bacteria, Sias and the related NulOs can also be found in diverse cellular structures, including capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharide O-antigens or as part of flagella, pili, or structures such as the cell wall or S-layer (Chapter 21). Bacteria with close relationships to vertebrate hosts often mimic the terminal placement of Sias on capsules and O-antigens. However, many NulOs of bacteria, including Sias, can occur as internal glycan components within repeating units of polysaccharides, which have also been reported in some invertebrates such as echinoderms. In the latter, the C-4 hydroxyl of Neu5Ac is sometimes glycosylated with other monosaccharides such as fucose, galactose, and glucose. Overall, it appears that we do not yet know the full extent of sialoglycan diversity in nature. Polysialic acid (polySia, previously called PSA) is a linear homopolymer of Sias that sometimes reaches lengths of more than 100 residues. Shorter chains of two to three residues, called oligosialic acids, are common components of gangliosides (Figure 15.3 and Chapter 11) and are found occasionally as terminal structures on glycoprotein glycans. PolySia is a prominent structural feature of a highly select group of acceptor proteins, the best studied of which is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Beginning early in vertebrate brain development, long polySia chains (Neu5Acα2-8)n are added to NCAM (often then called PSA-NCAM), on the termini of two specific N-glycans. The large hydration shell formed by polySia markedly increases the hydrodynamic volume of its protein carrier and interferes with NCAM's natural cell–cell adhesion function. PolySia thus converts an adhesive protein into a repelling one. During brain development, a high level of polySia likely ensures that neural precursors can migrate to their final anatomical sites. Once a destination is reached, polySia is down-regulated and firm adhesion proceeds, keeping the cells in place. When the sialyltransferases (STs) responsible for polySia formation are genetically ablated in mice, some nerve progenitor cells adhere prematurely, become stuck in place and fail to reach their proper destination. In contrast to the above-mentioned “repulsive field effects,” polySia can also act an “attractive field,” binding and locally concentrating neurotrophic factors like BDNF and FGF2. Notably, human genetic and molecular evidence indicate that variations in polysialylation may be a factor in human psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia.""]","The incorporation of diet-derived Neu5Gc into human glycans explains the presence of ""Hanganutziu-Deicher"" antibodies in cancer patients.

Historically, such isolation methods have used affinity chromatography. For example, a high density of lactose linked to agarose in the form of an affinity column can be used to isolate galectins, which can be eluted with lactose as a hapten. The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) was isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized yeast mannans containing phosphorylated mannose.","['The binding of L-PHA is used to identify specific types of branched N-glycans in cells. L-PHA binding is dramatically decreased in mice genetically null for the branching β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT5 and -5B) (Chapter 9). The expression of L- or E-PHA-binding glycoproteins is increased in many tumor cells (Chapter 47). Similar studies show E-PHA binds bisected complex-type N-glycans containing the GlcNAcβ1-4Man-R in the core, and such structures are produced by MGAT3, and E-PHA-binding glycans are also elevated in some tumor cells. Thus, using a variety of lectins and antibodies, it is possible to deduce many aspects of glycan structures. Microarrays in which a variety of lectins and antibodies are printed on a slide can also give valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. This approach is especially sensitive in regard to defining whether biological samples differ in glycosylation. For example, such microarrays have been used to identify glycosylation differences in melanoma metastasis, leading to the identification of core fucose as a critical determinant of metastatic potential. There are several approaches to using antibodies and lectins in glycan purification, including affinity chromatography or affinity binding and immunoprecipitation or lectin-induced precipitation. The proteins may be covalently coupled to a carrier such as Sepharose or biotinylated and captured on streptavidin-Sepharose. In addition, antibodies may be noncovalently captured on protein A (or G)-Sepharose. These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants. ConA-Sepharose is commonly used to isolate glycoproteins as it shows little binding to nonglycosylated proteins. However, it does not bind all glycoproteins because it recognizes specific N-glycan structures. ConA-Sepharose has also been used to isolate free oligo- and polymannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary N-glycans. When combined in a serial format, multiple lectins can be used in affinity chromatography to isolate glycoconjugates containing most of the major glycan structures present in animal cells, with glycoconjugates being separated as classes that share common determinants. An example of serial lectin affinity chromatography is shown in Figure 48.8. Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications. Release of glycans coupled with ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can yield highly pure glycans with predicted structures that can then be confirmed by mass spectrometry of native and permethylated derivatives (Chapters 50 and 51). An example of the use of different immobilized plant lectins in serial lectin affinity chromatography of complex mixtures of glycopeptides. In this example, a mixture of glycopeptides is applied to a column of immobilized concanavalin A (ConA), and the (more...) Mixed-bed lectin chromatography using a combination of different immobilized lectins is useful for simultaneously separating all types of glycoconjugates from nonglycosylated material (e.g., glycopeptides from peptides). Combinations of affinity chromatography and other chromatographic techniques can be very useful in identifying and separating glycopeptides. Thus, the ability of glycans to be recognized by lectins dependent on specific structural features in the glycans is a powerful tool for glycan identification and isolation. In some approaches, the glycans are tagged at the reducing end by fluorophores and radioisotopes or may be obtained by metabolic radiolabeling from cells or tissues grown in the presence of radiolabeled sugar precursors, such as [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans.'
 'In these approaches, the concentrations of lectins and antibodies used must be low enough both to reduce false-positive, nonspecific binding and to allow for inhibition by appropriate haptens to confirm sugar binding. Removal of N-glycans by PNGaseF, or of sialic acid by neuraminidase, can eliminate binding to specific lectins and antibodies in western blotting, thus indicating the lectin/antibody-bound determinant. Mention should also be made about the approaches to isolate novel lectins from natural sources, or even when made recombinantly or in the form of some type of GRP. Historically, such isolation methods have used affinity chromatography. For example, a high density of lactose linked to agarose in the form of an affinity column can be used to isolate galectins, which can be eluted with lactose as a hapten. The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) was isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized yeast mannans containing phosphorylated mannose. There are also other forms of isolation, including salt precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and the capture of a tagged and recombinant chimeric-lectin by capture of the tag (e.g., His tag). A recent method exploits a “capture and release” approach, in which multivalent ligands recognized by a lectin are assembled, whereby they can capture the lectin of interest, and then filtration or centrifugation may be used to isolate the lectin complexed with ligand. The lectin can then be dissociated and is available for study. Any of these type of methods are also useful when combined with proteomic analyses in identifying novel lectins and protein complexes that bind to glycans. The classic approaches for using antibodies, CBMs, and lectins to characterize cell-surface glycoconjugates are histochemistry (lectins) and immunohistochemistry (antibodies), flow cytometry with cell sorting, and cell agglutination. In histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, tissues are prepared and fixed as usual for histological staining, and then incubated with appropriate biotinylated or peroxidase-labeled lectins or antibodies (glycolipids are extracted during standard paraffin embedding procedures and require frozen sections for sensitive detection). The bound lectins, CBMs, or antibodies are then visualized by means of secondary reagents, such as streptavidin-peroxidase or labeled secondary antibody. These approaches often yield information that is difficult to obtain by any other approach. For example, they can reveal the spatial orientation of different glycans, their relative abundance, and whether they are intracellular and/or extracellular. Three important controls in such studies are (1) use of lectins, CBMs, or antibodies at limiting concentrations to avoid nonspecific binding; (2) confirmation of the specificity of binding by appropriate inhibition by haptens or by destruction of the predicted target glycans with glycosidases; and (3) use of multiple lectins, CBMs, or antibodies to provide further confirmation of the conclusions. Lectins and antibodies to glycans have also been widely used in flow cytometry and cell sorting. In such studies, cells are incubated with low, nonagglutinating levels of lectins or antibodies that are biotinylated and conjugated to fluorescently labeled streptavidin or directly fluorescently labeled. Cells with bound lectins or antibodies can then be identified by their fluorescence in the flow cytometer, and the degree of fluorescence can be correlated with the number of binding sites. A key consideration in flow cytometry is to avoid high concentrations of lectins or antibodies that cause agglutination of cells. Lectins and antibodies can also be used to identify specific membrane localization of different glycans, using confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. Lectins and antibodies are useful for characterizing cell-surface glycans when limited numbers of cells are available. Studies on glycosylation of embryonic stem cells have been greatly aided by using panels of specific lectins to identify unique glycan determinants and changes in their expression during cellular differentiation. A recent variation of this approach is to use a microarray of immobilized lectins, which are probed with fluorescently labeled glycoproteins in extracts of cells.'
 'Lectins and antibodies are useful for characterizing cell-surface glycans when limited numbers of cells are available.

A recent variation of this approach is to use a microarray of immobilized lectins, which are probed with fluorescently labeled glycoproteins in extracts of cells. Such assays can reveal minor differences in protein glycosylation between different samples and give insight into the glycan structures that are present. One of the oldest uses of lectins is in the agglutination and precipitation of glycoconjugates, cells, and membrane vesicle preparations. The easiest assay for many soluble lectins that are multivalent is agglutination of target cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, or even bacteria or fungi. Agglutination can often be easily observed without a microscope, but it is also measurable in instruments such as aggregometers. In these assays, a lectin solution is serially diluted and the reciprocal of the final dilution that gives measurable cell agglutination is taken to define the activity. Bacterial agglutination by plant and animal lectins is often used to explore the surface glycocalyx and changes in glycocalyx on culture conditions and to define phenotypes of different strains or serotypes. Lectin precipitation and aggregation can be used to define the glycan composition and overall architecture of polysaccharides, as has been done for bacterial, algal, plant, and animal polysaccharides. Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. Fluorescent-tagged glycoproteins from a source (e.g., cell or tissue extracts) can be applied to these arrays and the binding pattern compared to a control sample can reveal features of the glycome of the material, such as patterns of sialylation, fucosylation, and even linkages of residues with glycans using linkage-specific reagents. The advantages of this approach is the microscale in which it can be performed, the relatively high-throughput nature of the technology, and the precision of discrimination in terms of differential glycosylation between two samples. The system is particularly adaptable to include new reagents as they become available (e.g., new lectins or engineered proteins). An important use of lectins and antibodies has been in the selection of cell lines (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] cells) that express altered cell-surface glycans. The common lectins that have been used are ConA, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin), L-PHA, LCA, PSA (Pisum sativum agglutinin), E-PHA, ricin, modeccin, and abrin. The latter three lectins are heterodimeric, disulfide-bonded proteins that are classified as type-II ribosome-inactivating proteins; they contain an A subunit that constitutes an enzyme called RNA-N-glycosidase, which inactivates the 28S ribosome, and a B subunit that is a galactose-binding lectin (Chapter 31). Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture. One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained.'
 'In some approaches, the glycans are tagged at the reducing end by fluorophores and radioisotopes or may be obtained by metabolic radiolabeling from cells or tissues grown in the presence of radiolabeled sugar precursors, such as [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans. When intact glycoproteins or complex polysaccharides (e.g., those found in plant cell walls [Chapter 24]) are analyzed for their interactions with plant lectins or antibodies, the interpretation of data may be complicated by the multivalency of the glycoprotein/polysaccharide and the density of the immobilized lectin/antibody. For example, glycoproteins containing multiple high-mannose-type N-glycans bind so tightly to immobilized ConA that it is difficult to elute the bound glycoprotein, even with extremely high concentrations of hapten and under harsh conditions. Lower densities of ConA conjugation reduce its avidity for the glycoproteins and promote hapten dissociation of bound ligands with lower concentrations of sugars. When used in combination, multiple lectins, such as ConA, AAL (Aleuria aurantia lectin), LCA, and RCA (Ricinus communis agglutinin), can be used to isolate most glycoproteins containing N-and O-glycans from animal cells. This is a potentially powerful approach for glycoproteomics, or the identification of glycoproteins and their glycosylation status. Another approach to enhance glycoproteomic analyses is to use multiple lectins in mixed-bed or multi-lectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC). In such an approach a number of different lectins are used that recognize different glycan features, such as those shown in earlier figures in this chapter. Glycoproteins (or glycopeptides) with these selected features can be isolated and enriched from complex mixtures, allowing for more focused analyses on the glycoconjugates of interest. In addition, in some types of analyses a genetic disruption can result in the collapse of classes of glycans to a single structure, allowing a lectin-enrichment strategy to be particularly useful in identifying the glycomic features of interest. For example, deletion of the gene Cosmc (C1GalT1C1) in cell lines leads to the collapse of GalNAc-type O-glycans, which can vary immensely in structure, to a single structure, the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). These derived cell lines are termed SimpleCells. If glycopeptides are prepared from such cells, all glycopeptides that contain an O-glycan with the Tn antigen can be affinity purified using immobilized Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA). The isolated glycopeptides can then be sequence-identified. In this type of approach the O-glycoproteome of cells regarding sites of O-GalNAc-type O-glycosylation can be more readily characterized, as there is no universal set of reagents that can generally recognize all the different types of O-glycans in normal cell-derived glycoproteins. Lectins and antibodies can also be used in western blotting approaches to characterize protein and lipid glycosylation, in which biotinylated lectin or antibody probes are applied to material transferred to nitrocellulose or other supports after electrophoresis or chromatography. The bound lectins/antibodies are visualized by binding streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and conversion of luminescent substrates. In these approaches, the concentrations of lectins and antibodies used must be low enough both to reduce false-positive, nonspecific binding and to allow for inhibition by appropriate haptens to confirm sugar binding. Removal of N-glycans by PNGaseF, or of sialic acid by neuraminidase, can eliminate binding to specific lectins and antibodies in western blotting, thus indicating the lectin/antibody-bound determinant.'
 'As an example, an inactivated bacteriophage-derived endosialidase has been shown to have lectin-like properties and can be used as a probe in the specific detection of its substrate, polysialic acid. More often, however, the inactivated enzyme requires additional engineering to amplify its affinity and/or improve its selectivity/specificity for the glycan substrate of interest. Thus, the development of structure-based protein engineering promises a new avenue to generate glycan-detection reagents with complementary and sometimes preferable features to those offered by traditional lectins and antibodies. Some of the important uses of lectins, CBMs, and antibodies are illustrated in Figure 48.7. Antibodies, lectins, and CBMs each have distinct advantages. Lectins are usually less expensive than antibodies and are often naturally available in seeds and plant materials. The genes encoding many CBMs have been cloned, enabling facile heterologous expression to obtain needed quantities of the protein. However, antibodies, lectins, and CBMs are often needed to bind a wide variety of glycan determinants. For example, no plant lectins specific for the SLea or the Lex antigens have been identified, whereas mAbs to these antigens are available. Conversely, no mAbs have been identified that bind general determinants, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid and core fucose, whereas lectins have this discriminating ability (e.g., Sambucus nigra agglutinin [SNA] and L. culinaris [LcH], respectively). Of course, many GRPs recognize determinants independently of their presentation—that is, the same epitope may be presented on multiple types of glycans (e.g., O-glycans, N-glycans, or glycolipids). Although available antibodies thus far cannot distinguish common N-glycan structural motifs, such features are well-recognized by some plant lectins. For example, the plant lectin ConA does not bind mucin-type O-glycans in animal cells, but binds only to some specific classes of N-glycans (Figure 48.1). Additionally, E-PHA binds “bisected” complex-type N-glycans (Figure 48.2) and does not bind known glycolipids or O-glycans. Great care should be taken, however, to use lectins and antibodies at appropriate concentrations in which their specificity can be exploited. Examples of different uses of plant and animal lectins, carbohydrate-binding molecules (CBMs), and antibodies in glycobiology. Many plant and animal lectins are multivalent as shown, and antibodies are always multivalent, whereas CBMs are monovalent. (more...) The glycan determinants bound with highest affinity by each of these probes have been identified by a combination of approaches, including affinity chromatography, glycan synthesis, and binding to specific glycoconjugates, cells, and glycan microarrays. A good example of this is the L-PHA, which is often used by immunologists as a mitogen to stimulate quiescent T cells to divide. L-PHA originates from the red kidney bean Phaseolus vulgaris, which also contains isolectins to L-PHA—notably E-PHA. L-PHA binds to certain branched, complex-type N-glycans containing the pentasaccharide sequence Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2(Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6)Manα1-R (the so-called “2-6-branch”), as shown in the boxed portion of the glycan in Figure 48.2. Curiously, the only monosaccharide that effectively inhibits either L-PHA or E-PHA is GalNAc, although this monosaccharide is not part of the N-glycan determinants recognized by these lectins (Figure 48.2). The binding of L-PHA is used to identify specific types of branched N-glycans in cells. L-PHA binding is dramatically decreased in mice genetically null for the branching β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT5 and -5B) (Chapter 9). The expression of L- or E-PHA-binding glycoproteins is increased in many tumor cells (Chapter 47).']","An example of an approach to isolate novel lectins from natural sources or when made recombinantly or in the form of some type of GRP is through affinity chromatography. For instance, a high density of lactose linked to agarose in the form of an affinity column can be utilized to isolate galectins, which can then be eluted with lactose as a hapten. Another example is the isolation of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) through affinity chromatography on immobilized yeast mannans containing phosphorylated mannose.","There are also other forms of isolation, including salt precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and the capture of a tagged and recombinant chimeric-lectin by capture of the tag (e.g., His tag).

Regardless of the method used to induce mutations, selection or enrichment is usually needed to find rare recessive or dominant mutants bearing a desired glycosylation phenotype (Figure 49.1). For example, direct selection for resistance to cytotoxic plant lectins (Chapters 31 and 32) that bind to cell-surface glycans gives a range of glycosylation mutants. Importantly, many mutants resistant to one or more lectins because of the loss of specific sugars become supersensitive to a different group of lectins that recognize sugar residues exposed by the mutation (Figure 49.2). The latter may be used to select for revertants in the original mutant population. Nontoxic lectins are also useful for enriching lectin-binding mutants (e.g., by flow cytometry). Mutations that affect all stages of glycosylation reactions, including the generation and transport of nucleotide sugars, have been identified using lectins as selective agents. In principle, any glycan-binding protein (GBP), antibody, or other agent that recognizes cell-surface glycans or a glycoprotein can be used to isolate mutants with a glycosylation defect (Figure 49.2). Conjugation of a GBP or protein domain to a toxin that cannot enter the cell independently, but can kill the cell following entry, can be used to select mutants when cytotoxic lectins are not available. For example, basic fibroblast growth factor FGF2-saporin complexes have been used for the selection of mutants deficient in heparan sulfate (HS). Lectins, antibodies, or ligands that are fluorescently tagged may be used to enrich for mutants that are either deficient in binding or have acquired a novel binding ability because of altered glycosylation or reduced expression of an antigen at the cell surface. Panning or immunodepletion are related techniques. For example, coating a plate with FGF2 allows selection of mutant cells that fail to produce HS proteoglycans and consequently fail to adhere to a FGF2-coated plate. HAP1 cells that fail to glycosylate α-dystroglycan fail to bind a specific monoclonal antibody and may be enriched by immunodepletion (Figure 49.2). Radiation suicide is another direct selection method for obtaining glycosylation mutants. Incubation of cells with a radioactive sugar, sulfate, or other precursor of high radioactivity leads to labeled glycoproteins, glycolipids, or proteoglycans. After prolonged storage of the cells, radiation damage kills wild-type cells, whereas mutants with reduced incorporation of the label survive. Animal cells can also be replica-plated, much like microbial colonies, using porous cloth made of polyester or nylon as the replica (Figure 49.2). Colonies of cells on the disc can be used to identify mutants with reduced incorporation of radioactive precursors or to identify mutants that fail to bind to a lectin, an antibody, or a growth factor. An adaptation of this technique allows detection of mutants affecting a specific enzyme by direct assay for activity in colony lysates generated on a disc. Although this technique has great specificity, its limited capacity makes detection of rare mutants difficult, and mutagenesis before screening is usually a requirement.'

An adaptation of this technique allows detection of mutants affecting a specific enzyme by direct assay for activity in colony lysates generated on a disc. Although this technique has great specificity, its limited capacity makes detection of rare mutants difficult, and mutagenesis before screening is usually a requirement. The resulting strains must be cloned and carefully characterized for stability and the biochemical and molecular basis of mutation. Additional genetic analyses include somatic cell hybridization for dominance/recessive testing and assigning mutants to different genetic complementation groups. Specifically, when mutations are introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), the affected genes can be identified through deep sequencing analysis of enriched sgRNA populations. Regardless of the technique used to isolate mutants, biochemical analysis involves the characterization of glycan structures produced by mutant cells (Chapter 50), the quantitation and analysis of intermediates, and assays for activities thought to be missing or acquired based on the properties of the mutant. Identifying the molecular basis of mutation requires isolation of a complementing cDNA that reverts the mutant phenotype and determining whether the mutation arose from defective transcription, translation, or stability of the gene product or from a missense or nonsense mutation in the coding region of the gene. Targeted gene mutation (Chapter 56) can also be used to validate a phenotype after a gene has been identified in a selected mutant. Transgenic mice that overexpress a glycosylation gene, or mutant mice that lack a glycosylation activity because of targeted gene inactivation (Chapters 27 and 56), are a source of mutant cells that may be used for glycobiology research. Fibroblasts or lymphoblasts can be obtained readily from humans with a disorder of glycosylation (Chapter 45). Cells may be grown as primary cultures or immortalized by viral transformation. By crossing mutant mice with the Immortomouse, which carries a temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen in every cell, immortalized mutant cell lines can be derived from essentially any cell type. For mutations that cause embryos to die during gestation, mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells can be derived from blastocysts, provided the mutation does not result in cell-autonomous lethality. The resulting mutant ES cell lines can be used to investigate functions for specific glycans during differentiation in embryoid cell culture, or in vivo in mouse chimeras. A chimera is obtained by injecting wild-type or mutant ES cells into the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst. If the ES cells survive, the resulting mouse is a mixture of cells derived from the ES cells and cells derived from the blastocyst and is termed a chimera. Mutant ES cells may not contribute equally well to all tissues. For example, ES cells lacking MGAT1 are unable to make complex or hybrid N-glycans (Chapter 9), but they differentiate normally into many cell types in cultured embryoid bodies. However, following introduction into blastocysts, ES cells lacking MGAT1 do not contribute to the organized layer of bronchial epithelium in chimeric embryos. Immortalized fibroblasts from patients with defects in glycosylation can be used to study the underlying defect (Chapter 45). Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts from patients with glycosylation disorders provide another approach for obtaining various differentiated cell lines for further study. The use of precise genetic engineering tools allows the correction of a genetic mutation in patient-derived fibroblasts, thereby creating pairs of isogenic cell lines for comparative studies. Alternatively, such isogenic pairs can be generated by introducing the patient-specific mutation in a cell or cell line of choice (Chapter 56). Selection schemes based on isolating rare mutants resistant to cytotoxic plant lectins have yielded a large number of glycosylation mutants affected in diverse aspects of glycan synthesis (Table 49.1). Some mutations affect several types of glycans, such as mutants with reduced nucleotide sugar formation or transport into the Golgi.'

Rapid progress in understanding glycosylation pathways of eukaryotes came with the application of genetic strategies to isolate mutants of mammalian cells and yeast with alterations in glycan synthesis. This chapter reviews methods used to isolate mammalian cell glycosylation mutants and the diversity of mutants that may be obtained from selections and screens. The applications of glycosylation mutants to address functional roles of glycans and in glycosylation engineering are discussed briefly. Many of the cell lines described in this chapter are available through the American Type Culture Collection. The success of bacterial and yeast genetics in isolating mutants and using them to define biochemical pathways led in the late 1960s to the development of somatic cell genetics using mammalian cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were selected by two independent groups for initial experiments to isolate stable mutants. Somatic cell genetic strategies were applied early to glycobiology, yielding numerous mutants in glycoprotein biosynthesis and later in proteoglycan, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and glycolipid biosynthesis. The ability to isolate glycosylation mutants in mammalian cells made it possible to unravel pathways of glycan synthesis and degradation and to identify, isolate, and map structural and regulatory genes. CHO cells thus became a focus for experiments to decipher glycosylation pathways and, importantly, provided mutant host cells for the production of viruses and glycoproteins with modified glycans. This proved to be extremely beneficial to the biotechnology industry because most recombinant therapeutics are glycoproteins. CHO cells and CHO glycosylation mutants are now the workhorse of the biotechnology industry. They are particularly useful because they produce only minor, if any, quantities of nonhuman glycans or glycan modifications that give rise to undesirable antibodies. Conserved glycosylation pathways in yeast were delineated by similar approaches (Chapter 23). Mutants in any cell type often accumulate the precursor immediately upstream of the block in a pathway and thereby reveal the structure of their substrate(s). Sequencing of mutant alleles reveals specific mutations that may give rise to a glycosylation phenotype. In most cases, mutations are loss-of-function and they reduce or abrogate the activity of an enzyme in a pathway; but there are also gain-of-function mutations that activate a silent glycosylation gene, elevate the expression of an existing activity, or inactivate a negative regulatory factor (Figure 49.1). In nearly all cases, glycosylation mutations lead to the presence of altered glycans on cell-surface glycoconjugates and changes in cell properties that link glycan structure to function. Although gene editing techniques using CRISPR/Cas9 or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are now the method of choice for introducing a mutation that weakens or ablates a glycosylation gene (Chapters 27 and 56), initially such approaches did not allow for the serendipitous findings that often emerge from genetic screens. Subsequently, genetic screens were performed using HAP1 (haploid) human cells mutagenized by retroviral gene trap. Such unbiased screens led to the identification of multiple, previously unknown, glycosylation genes. Lately, however, the evolvement of CRISPR tools and the generation of genome-wide libraries have made it possible to conduct both loss-of-function and gain-of-function screens in nonhaploid cell lines, providing an unbiased strategy to discover new genes that influence cellular glycosylation (Figure 49.2).

 'Gene ablation studies in mice have identified numerous cases in which an intact glycosylation pathway is essential for embryogenesis. Examples include mutants that lack complex and hybrid N-glycans and proteoglycan mutants defective in HS, whereas the corresponding mutants in CHO cells do not cause an obvious growth phenotype. To address the role of glycans in more complex functions, introduction of mutations in stem cells compatible with creation of organoid or even organotypic 3D tissue cultures is used. For example, a human 3D organotypic skin model was used to address the contributions of various glycans on distinct types of glycoconjugates (glycolipids, N-glycans, O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc) by targeting of core extension steps. These studies demonstrated distinct tissue phenotypes for each of the mutant lines grown in 3D cultures, whereas no obvious growth phenotype was observed in conventional 2D cultures. Thus, glycosylation is often critical in the context of a multicellular organism but dispensable in isolated cells. This conclusion has been driven home by gene ablation studies in mice and further evidenced by the discovery of human genetic diseases which arise from mutations in genes involved in glycosylation (Chapter 45). CHO cells have become the cells of choice for the biotechnology industry in the production of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins and in glycosylation engineering (see Chapter 56). For example, CHO cells lacking FUT8, which adds fucose to the core GlcNAc of complex N-glycans, are used to produce cytotoxic therapeutic antibodies that have a greatly enhanced ability to kill their target cells. In another example, CHO cells with multiple mutations that simplify N- and O-glycans are being used by X-ray crystallographers to produce homogeneous preparations of membrane glycoproteins with highly truncated N- and O-glycans, greatly facilitating their crystallization. Somatic cell genetics arose from the desire to manipulate the genome of cultured cells in vitro. Today, the availability of genomic sequences from multiple organisms has shifted the emphasis in genetics toward the generation of mutant organisms using the techniques of transgenesis, homologous recombination for gene replacement, conditional gene inactivation, and precise gene editing. However, the study of somatic cell mutants still plays an important role in glycobiology research because it provides a less-expensive and faster method for studying the effects of deleting or expressing particular glycosylation gene products in a cell. Gain-of-function mutants may of course be generated by transfection of cDNAs encoding glycosylation genes, and reduced expression of any gene can be achieved by the use of RNA interference (RNAi), antisense cDNA strategies, or genome-wide gene editing screens. The combination of genome-wide screening and specific agents to select for glycan changes make it possible to discover new genes by screening for phenotypic changes directly related to glycosylation changes. Additionally, cells and mutants with well-characterized glycosylation pathways are ideal hosts for investigating the activity encoded by a putative glycosylation gene identified in genome sequence databases. These mutant cells also provide a platform to test the severity of human mutations in a complementation test: The normal human gene rescues defective glycosylation when transfected into the mutant cell, but the same gene with a pathological mutation does not. Thus, somatic cell mutants provide access to novel genes involved in glycosylation, which in turn guide strategies for sophisticated gene-manipulation experiments in animals. By combining the two approaches, the biological function of a particular glycosyltransferase, sugar residue, or lectin can be defined. Coupled with powerful mass spectrometry techniques for determining glycan structures (Chapter 50) from small samples of tissue or cells, glycosylation mutants of cells and animals provide complementary material for structure/function analyses and identifying mechanistic bases of glycan functions in mammals.

 'Similarly, a defective sialyltransferase or galactosyltransferase may cause these glycans to be truncated. A mutant of B16 melanoma cells that is defective in ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase) lacks all glycolipids because this enzyme catalyzes the first step in the synthetic pathway (Chapter 11). However, cultured cell mutants defective in polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases (GALNTs) or protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) have not been isolated. This may reflect the paucity of cytotoxic lectins or toxins that bind to O-glycans and glycolipids or, in some cases, due to redundancy of enzymes (Chapters 10 and 11). However, cell mutants defective in most of the GALNTs, POFUT1, POGLUT1, and the various O-mannosyl transferases, including POMT1/2 and TMTC1-3, are now made available through precise genetic engineering. The same is the case with mutants in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids. In addition, mice lacking specific glycolipid biosynthetic enzymes and glycosyltransferases that transfer GlcNAc or Fuc to protein have been generated and provide a source of mutant cells that may be studied in culture. Interestingly, cells lacking the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) that acts in the cytoplasm to transfer GlcNAc to protein have not been obtained, and mouse mutants defective in this transferase become arrested in development at the two-cell-stage embryo, showing that this O-GlcNAc addition is essential for cell viability. Fortunately, the vast majority of glycosylation mutations allow single-cell viability in vitro under ideal culture conditions. Glycosylation mutants of mammalian cells have thus been used to address many questions in glycobiology and for glycosylation engineering of recombinant glycoproteins (Chapter 56). Because mutant selections are broad and often not intentionally biased, they generate mutants defective in both known and novel reactions. Thus, glycosylation mutants play an important role in research to define the pathways and regulation of glycosylation in mammals. In this regard, they are more useful tools than mutant mice because cells in culture are viable in the absence of glycolipids, GPI anchors, proteoglycans, O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc, O-Man glycans, and complex or hybrid N-glycans. Glycosylation mutants make truncated or altered glycans and thus provide an opportunity to study functional roles for cell-surface glycans in the context of a living cell. Important insights have been gained into specific sugars required for viral, bacterial, or parasite adhesion and infection, and for leukocyte cell adhesion and motility. In addition, functional roles for glycans in the intracellular sorting and secretion of glycoproteins, in growth factor binding and activation, and in receptor functions have been identified using glycosylation mutants. For example, a panel of CHO glycosylation mutants was used in a coculture assay to show that ligand-induced Notch signaling is reduced when GDP-Fuc levels are low, but is unaffected by reductions in Sia. Similarly, one of the first demonstrations for coreceptor functions for HS used mutant CHO cells defective in HS synthesis and engineered to express the FGF receptor. Most recently, genome-wide gene editing is being combined with screens for an altered phenotype to identify genes that contribute to that particular phenotype. For example, genes that facilitate infection by SARS-CoV-2 were uncovered in a genome-wide genetic screen. Although glycosylation is in many cases dispensable for survival of isolated cells in a culture dish, it is often crucial in vivo. Gene ablation studies in mice have identified numerous cases in which an intact glycosylation pathway is essential for embryogenesis. Examples include mutants that lack complex and hybrid N-glycans and proteoglycan mutants defective in HS, whereas the corresponding mutants in CHO cells do not cause an obvious growth phenotype. To address the role of glycans in more complex functions, introduction of mutations in stem cells compatible with creation of organoid or even organotypic 3D tissue cultures is used.']","To greatly increase the probability of finding desirable mutants, mutations may be induced by treating cells with chemical (e.g., alkylating agents), physical (e.g., ionizing radiation), or biological (e.g., a virus) mutagens or, perhaps more likely, by lentiviral transduction with CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide or focused libraries.","Regardless of the method used to induce mutations, selection or enrichment is usually needed to find rare recessive or dominant mutants bearing a desired glycosylation phenotype (Figure 49.1). For example, direct selection for resistance to cytotoxic plant lectins (Chapters 31 and 32) that bind to cell-surface glycans gives a range of glycosylation mutants. Importantly, many mutants resistant to one or more lectins because of the loss of specific sugars become supersensitive to a different group of lectins that recognize sugar residues exposed by the mutation (Figure 49.2). The latter may be used to select for revertants in the original mutant population. Nontoxic lectins are also useful for enriching lectin-binding mutants (e.g., by flow cytometry). Mutations that affect all stages of glycosylation reactions, including the generation and transport of nucleotide sugars, have been identified using lectins as selective agents.",1.0,0.6603122265724981,0.5573571157335885,0.030303030303030304,0.99999999998,1.0
Complete the following paragraph: Linkage analysis is a well-established and ingenious approach for determining linkage positions. The principle of this method is to introduce a stable substituent (an ether-linked methyl group) onto each free hydroxyl group of the native glycan.,"['Reduction of the aldehyde of free monosaccharides followed by acetylation of their hydroxyl groups provides derivatives termed “alditol acetates.” These modified monosaccharides can be readily analyzed by GC-MS and compared with authentic standards. The hydroxyl and amino groups of free monosaccharides generated by glycan hydrolysis can also be converted to trimethylsilyl ethers. These per-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives are widely used for monosaccharide compositional analysis by GC-MS. Incorporation of an optically pure chiral aglycone (e.g., [–]-2-butyl alcohol), in combination with trimethylsilylation, allows the GC separation of D and L isomers and thus determination of the absolute configuration of each monosaccharide. An alternative to GC-MS is high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), a special type of ion exchange chromatography which does not require monosaccharide derivatization. This technique is especially useful for analyzing acidic sugars such as Sia, which are refractory to GC-MS. A convenient method for quantitating Sia, that does not require expensive equipment, involves tagging with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene-dioxybenzene and measuring fluorescence. This method has a detection sensitivity in the femtomole range, and can also pick up many of the naturally occurring modifications of this diverse class of monosaccharides (Chapter 15). Other popular techniques for defining monosaccharide composition are HPLC and high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE). The monosaccharides are usually tagged with a fluorescent derivative for high-sensitivity detection. Tagging with 8-amino-1,3,6-naphthalene trisulfonic acid yields anionic derivatives that can be conveniently analyzed by gel electrophoresis. This is referred to as fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). Linkage analysis is a well-established and ingenious approach for determining linkage positions. The principle of this method is to introduce a stable substituent (an ether-linked methyl group) onto each free hydroxyl group of the native glycan. Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol). This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide. However, linkage analysis provides no information on the nature of substituents or sequence information and cannot reveal α- or β-anomeric configuration. (See following page.)'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.53 Peter H. Seeberger and Hermen S. Overkleeft. Pure glycans of defined structure are essential research tools in glycobiology. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, which can be obtained in homogeneous forms by recombinant expression and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, glycans produced in biological systems are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the quantities that can be obtained from biological systems are often small. Chemical synthesis can be used to obtain homogeneous glycans in larger quantities than are available from most cellular production systems. Chemical synthesis can be further employed to incorporate glycans into homogeneous glycoproteins. This chapter summarizes the current state of the art in chemical methods to produce glycans. Enzymes can be used together with chemical methods to prepare diverse glycans (Chapter 54). The structure of oligosaccharides render their synthesis more complicated than the synthesis of the other major classes of biomolecules: oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11). The choice of protecting groups and the order of protecting group installation are essential for a successful synthetic route. The most common protecting groups include benzyl ethers that stay in place through many synthetic steps (permanent protecting groups) or carbonates and esters that are removed during intermediate steps in a synthesis (temporary protecting groups). A wealth of information exists on the chemical generation of glycans and various protecting group manipulations used in the context of glycan synthesis. A glycosidic linkage is generally formed through the activation of a glycosylating agent (glycosyl donor) to create an electrophilic species that reacts with the nucleophile, for example, a hydroxyl group present on the glycosyl acceptor. Other possible acceptors include serine/threonine in the case of glycopeptides or a sphingoid in the case of glycosphingolipids. The glycosylation reaction results in the formation of either an α- or β-glycosidic linkage (see Chapter 2). A major challenge in glycan synthesis is the stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds (Figure 53.1A; Chapter 2). A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages. The yield and the stereochemical outcome of these reactions depend on the steric and electronic nature of the glycosylating agent (the glycosyl donor), the nature of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions. One common method to control the stereochemistry at the anomeric center involves the use of certain protecting groups, such as esters or amides/carbamates, on the C2-hydroxyl or C2-amino group (Figure 53.1B).'
 'To date, there is no enzyme that can release all classes of O-linked glycans. The enzyme O-glycanase (in contrast to the PNGase enzymes) is restricted to releasing only simple core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAcαS/T) O-glycans. Labeling of released glycans can optimize HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE) detectability and separability and may improve their MS properties. Many of these labeling approaches use reductive amination of the glycan at the reducing end or react the free amine at the reducing end that is left after PNGase F release. Fluorescent tags increase the sensitivity by lowering the limit of quantitation and detection. Permethylation and peracetylation, when all the mobile protons (present on hydroxyls, carboxyls, and amides) in a glycan are substituted by alkyls (e.g., -methyl) or esterified (e.g., -acetyl) convert the glycans from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic, making the glycans easier to purify and greatly improves the sensitivity and linkage determination by MS-based analyses. Both N- and O-glycans can also be analyzed as alditols in which the reducing end monosaccharide ring is converted into a reduced linear alditol by reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride. This reduction removes the anomeric ambiguity of the carbohydrate, where the α- and β-isomers of the reducing end sugar may otherwise separate into two peaks chromatographically. Tagging of the reducing ends of the released glycans (e.g., with 2-aminobenzamide [2-AB], aminobenzoic acid [2-AA], or aminopyridine [2-PA]) is often used for HILIC and reversed-phase LC separation of released glycans (Figure 51.1). Labeled dextran oligomer ladders are commonly used in LC as external standards to help define composition and size based on comparable retention times, for which an “incremental value” can be calculated for each monosaccharide present in the structure (Figure 51.1). CE with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) can also provide efficient, rapid, and quantitative separation of derivatized glycans. Glycans are mostly neutral structures so coupling a charged fluorescent label such as 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid (APTS) is necessary to provide electrophoretic mobility and to enable sensitive fluorescence detection. Further details can be assigned after digestion of glycan mixtures by one or more exoglycosidases that specifically cleave glycosidic bonds of individual monosaccharide units from the terminal residue producing predictable shifts in the HPLC or CE (or MS) profiles of the digests. Special derivatization protocols have also been developed to improve the quality of the MS fragmentation spectra of sialylated glycans—in particular, to target the charged carboxyl group of sialic acid residues. These can be converted into esters or amides to remove the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid that destabilizes the sialic acid in MALDI-MS and promotes undesirable in-source or post-source fragmentation in MS/MS. Specific derivatization of sialic acid residues can also help to determine by MS whether they are 2,3- or 2,6-linked to the glycan structure. An advantage of mass spectrometric glycan profiling is that different glycans can be identified at once by their mass and diagnostic fragmentation ions, increasing the throughput of the glycomic analysis. However, mass spectrometry of glycans may miss potentially important labile modifications, such as sulfation and O-acetylation, depending on the sample preparation and MS techniques applied. MS has inherent challenges because of the isomeric and sometimes isobaric nature of the constituent monosaccharide units that form multiple glycan isomers exhibiting the same molecular mass. Determining the molecular masses of glycans using MALDI- or ESI-MS gives a picture of the molecular distribution of glycans and allows a quantitative comparison of glycosylation between samples (Chapter 50).'
 'Like the hemiacetal, the acetal or glycosidic linkage can exist in two stereoisomeric forms: α and β. But unlike the hemiacetal, the acetal is configurationally stable under most conditions. Thus, once a glycosidic bond is formed, its configuration is maintained. Like acetals in general, glycosidic bonds can be hydrolyzed in dilute acid, generating the constituent monosaccharides from oligosaccharides. Glycoside formation. Conversion of a hemiacetal into an acetal.  Glycosidic bond construction is the central challenge of glycan synthesis and immense efforts have been devoted to high-yielding and stereoselective glycosylation reactions. An overview of glycan synthesis strategies is provided in Chapters 53 and 54. The hydroxyl groups present in both monosaccharides and oligosaccharides can be chemically modified without affecting the glycosidic linkages. Methylation is used in the structural analysis of glycans (see Chapter 50). Natural products containing partially methylated glycans are known and a number of methyltransferases have been identified. A variety of different enzymes can esterify the hydroxyl groups of glycans to transiently vary glycan structure. Esterification is sometimes required for interactions with other biomolecules. The most important types of sugar esters in nature are phosphate esters (including diphosphate esters), acyl esters (with acetic acid or fatty acids), and sulfate esters. Acyl esters can sometime migrate to other hydroxyl groups on the same monosaccharide. The replacement of monosaccharide hydroxyl groups with hydrogen atoms forms deoxysugars. Nature has evolved enzymes to perform this reaction in a minimum number of steps, whereas chemically multistep procedures are required. Deoxygenation of ribose within a ribonucleotide to form the 2-deoxyribonucleotide is a critical reaction in DNA biosynthesis. Fucose (Fuc), one of the common vertebrate monosaccharides, is deoxygenated at C-6 during its biosynthesis from mannose (Chapter 5). Many monosaccharides contain N-acetamido groups, such as GlcNAc, GalNAc, and NeuNAc. Free amino groups, formed by de-N-acetylation of the N-acetamido group, are rare and found in heparan sulfate (HS) (Chapter 17), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (Chapter 12), neuraminic acid (Chapter 15), and in many bacterial glycan structures (Chapter 20). Amino groups can be modified with sulfates, similar to hydroxyl groups, as found in HS. A variety of linkages can be formed between two monosaccharides. The glycosidic linkage can give rise to two possible stereoisomers at the anomeric carbon of one sugar (α or β). Also, the many hydroxyl groups of the other sugar permit several possible regioisomers. Two glucose residues, for example, can be joined together in numerous ways, as illustrated by maltose (Glcα4Glc) and gentiobiose (Glcβ6Glc) (Figure 2.14). These isomers have very different three-dimensional structures and biological activities. A monosaccharide can engage in more than two glycosidic linkages, thus serving as a branchpoint. The common occurrence of branched sequences (as opposed to the linear sequences that are found in almost all peptides and oligonucleotides) is unique to glycans and contributes to their structural diversity. Two isomeric disaccharides.  The relationship of the glycosidic bond to oligosaccharides is analogous to the relationship of the amide bond to polypeptides and the phosphodiester bond to polynucleotides. However, amino acids and nucleotides are linked in only one fashion during the formation of polypeptides and nucleic acids, respectively; there is no stereochemical or regiochemical diversity in these biopolymers.'
 'A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages. The yield and the stereochemical outcome of these reactions depend on the steric and electronic nature of the glycosylating agent (the glycosyl donor), the nature of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions. One common method to control the stereochemistry at the anomeric center involves the use of certain protecting groups, such as esters or amides/carbamates, on the C2-hydroxyl or C2-amino group (Figure 53.1B). These “participating neighboring” protecting groups can form a cyclic oxonium ion intermediate during the glycosylation reaction that shields one face of the molecule, leading exclusively to the formation of a “trans”-glycosidic linkage (i.e., where the anomeric substituent and the C2 group are on opposite sides of the ring, as in β-glucosides). The opposite anomeric stereochemistry, termed a “cis”-glycosidic bond, is more difficult to construct with high selectivity. Many different synthetic procedures have been developed for the stereoselective construction of cis-glycosidic linkages and linkages involving C2-deoxy sugars, though not as general as protecting group participation in the synthesis of trans-glycosidic linkages. The use of particular solvents/additives, remote protecting group participation, or preorganization of donor and acceptor and other methods have allowed for the stereocontrolled formation of an increasing number of cis-glycosidic linkages. (A) Stereospecific formation of glycosidic bonds as either an α- or β-linkage. (LG) Leaving group, (R) protecting group. (B) Formation of a cyclic oxonium ion intermediate leading to the formation of a β-glycosidic linkage.  Carbohydrates are endowed with a wealth of functional groups. This complicates glycan synthesis, and considerable time and effort are devoted to the development of suitable protective group schemes that allow for the protection and deprotection of individual functional groups at will. Carbohydrate functional groups include hydroxyls, amines, and carboxylates, and distinguishing between these is relatively easy. Selective address of hydroxyls—the most abundant functional groups in carbohydrates—is somewhat more complicated. Primary hydroxyls and anomeric hydroxyls are relatively easy to manipulate—specifically, the former for steric reasons and the latter because they are part of a hemiacetal or hemiketal. Specific access to secondary hydroxyls requires chemistry tailored to capitalize on, for instance, their configuration (cis-hydroxyls vs. trans-hydroxyls, equatorial vs. axial) and their relative reactivity (i.e., exploiting steric and/or electronic differences). A representative protective group scheme starting from S-tolylglucopyranose (the S-tolyl group serves as both a masking group of the anomeric hydroxyl and as leaving group in glycosylation schemes) is depicted in Figure 53.2. In the first step, all hydroxyls are transformed into the corresponding trimethylsilyl ethers to render the polar carbohydrate soluble in organic solvents. Next and in a series of complementary functional group manipulations, either O-2 (A), O-4 (B), or O-6 (C) is selectively liberated. In all instances, the first step comprises creation of the 4,6-O-benzylidene species. Reductive benzylation of O-3 followed by benzoylation of O-2 and reductive opening of the benzylidene toward the O-4-benzyl delivers glucose building block C. Alternative reductive opening of the benzylidene toward the O-6-benzyl delivers B, whereas leaving the benzylidene intact and removal of any remaining silyl protective groups delivers glucoside A. Protective group manipulations, which can be carried out in one-pot procedures, toward a series of glucopyranose-derived building blocks for glycan assembly.  In the synthesis of a fragment of a putative repeating unit of the exopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 53.3) the interplay between protective group pattern and glycosylation strategies becomes apparent.']","This stable substituent is introduced through methylation, which involves adding methyl groups to the free hydroxyl groups of the native glycan.","Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage.

These genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that make up the “transcriptome,” of which ∼30% are assigned to protein coding. The total complement of proteins expressed by the cell is collectively termed the “proteome.” Most eukaryotic proteins are post translationally modified (e.g., by phosphorylation, sulfation, oxidation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, lipidation, or glycosylation). These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher. The systems-level analysis of all proteins expressed by cells, tissues, or organisms is known as “proteomics.” The proteome, like the transcriptome, but unlike the DNA sequence of the genome, is fundamentally dynamic. The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle. As cells receive external and internal cues in the form of growth factors, hormones, metabolites, or cell–cell interactions, the expression of various genes is modulated and may be transcribed at levels ranging from silence to more than 104 mRNA copies per cell and 107 protein molecules per cell. Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation. However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome. Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27). The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward. The notion that glycans should be studied as a totality (glycomics), as well as simply one glycan or glycoconjugate at a time, developed when it became apparent that glycans form patterns on cells that change during development (Chapter 41), cancer progression (Chapter 47), infection (Chapters 42 and 43), and many other diseases (Chapters 44–46). Many glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins, are oligomerized on the cell surface and interact with multivalent arrays of glycans on the same or opposing cells (Chapters 28–38). Sometimes, multiple discrete glycans and their matching glycan-binding proteins work together to engage two cells or to deliver signals between cells.'

Aoki-Kinoshita, Avadhesha Surolia, and Pamela Stanley. A multitude of glycosyltransferases (GTs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs), other enzymes, and nucleotide sugar transporters are required to synthesize and metabolize glycans. Also, many genes encode glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), which recognize specific glycan structures. This chapter provides a genomic perspective of the genes that code for GTs, GHs, and GBPs. The glycome comprises all the glycan structures synthesized by an organism. It is analogous to the genome, the transcriptome, and/or the proteome but even more dynamic, and it has higher structural complexity that has yet to be fully defined. Cells of different types synthesize a subset of the glycome based on their differentiation state and physiological environment. The human and mouse glycomes have many glycan structures in common, but a few are unique or have divergent functional properties. For example, unlike humans, rodents synthesize cytidine monophospho-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Gc), for the transfer of Neu5Gc to N- and O-glycans (Chapter 15). Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26). The genome encodes all of the enzymes, transporters, and other activities necessary to construct and regulate the glycome of an organism. There were few complete genomes available in 1999 for the first edition of this book, approximately 650 genomes by the second edition (2009), 25,000 by the third edition (2015), and in August 2021 there were 259,000 permanent draft genomes in the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) of which more than 22,000 finished genomes are included in the manually curated Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database. Likewise, the number of GTs with a known three-dimensional structure has grown from one in 1999 to 158 in 2015 and 282 in 2020. The CAZy database is dedicated to (i) coping with the staggering increases in sequences released in GenBank by the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), (ii) creating new families based on the literature, and (iii) reporting new functions/substrate specificities and 3D structures within existing families. In the pre-genomic era, the glycobiology of mammals, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, and viruses did not overlap extensively, and progress in one domain did not immediately benefit others. With several genomes being released each day, the evolutionary history of GT and GH sequences has emerged. We now know that GTs from various organisms display the same basic structural folds, and we can harness the relationships between the sequence and the specificity of a GT (Chapter 6).'
 ""This is an important starting point for any comprehensive glycome analysis. The second level of analysis defines specific glycans associated with individual proteins or lipids. Analysis of the complete repertoire of a cell's glycoconjugates, including the microheterogeneity of glycans present at individual sites of attachment, lies, for example, at the intersection of glycomics and proteomics (“glycoproteomics”) and of glycomics and lipidomics (“glycolipidomics”). A third level of complexity involves determining which glycans and/or glycoconjugates are expressed in specific cells, tissues, or secretions at specific times or conditions. This level of analysis is essential if the goal is to reveal new functions in cell–cell communication or to correlate particular glycomes with specific diseases. Of course, none of these approaches recapitulates the actual arrangement of the complex glycan forest present on the surface of cells or in extracellular matrices. The spatial organization of the glycome on cell surfaces is currently only amenable to microscopy-, array- and flow cytometry–based imaging using various glycan-recognizing probes (lectins/GRPs; Chapter 48). The spatial organization of glycans in tissue sections can also be explored by recent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS imaging methods. The term “glycomics” thus describes studies designed to define the complete repertoire of glycans that a cell, tissue, or organism produces under specified conditions of time, location, and environment. “Glycoproteomics” describes this glycome as it appears on the cellular proteome. Glycoproteomics determines which sites on each glycoprotein of a cell are glycosylated and ideally includes the identification and quantitation of the heterogeneous glycan structures at each site. The molecular complexity of the glycoproteome makes glycomics and glycoproteomics both exciting and daunting. Because neither the genome, transcriptome, nor the proteome can accurately predict the dynamically expressed protein-linked glycans, the glycome and glycoproteome must be analyzed directly. Techniques used to characterize a single glycoprotein after isolation (Figure 51.1) or a complex mixture of glycoproteins (the glycoproteome) (Figure 51.2) are described in this chapter. Analysis of a purified single glycoprotein. Example of the characterization of an affinity purified serum glycoprotein, haptoglobin, including (left panel) a total glycomics profile of N-glycans released from the protein, fluorescently derivatized with (more...) Glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics of a complex mixture of glycoproteins. In this workflow, the structures of the PNGase F released N-glycans from a total extract of rat brain membrane proteins are first analyzed in detail (1) and the sites of glycosylation (more...) As described below, numerous techniques have been developed for interrogating the glycome and glycoproteome. Because no single technique can at present define all aspects of the glycome or glycoproteome, several approaches are typically used in parallel from assembling an individual cell type glycan repertoire to determining the global tissue expression for example. Different approaches and techniques are required to characterize, for example, the structures of glycoproteins versus glycolipids, N-glycans versus O-glycans, and sulfated GAGs versus neutral glycans (Chapter 50). In contrast, a single technique such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to identify and quantitate all mRNA transcripts at once, a much easier task. Glycomic methods and analyses have been mostly directed toward protein glycosylation because of the current proteomics focus, although considerable effort is being directed toward methods that encompass all glycan conjugates. As an example of a typical experiment, a glycoprotein-enriched sample is prepared from a cell lysate and their released glycans analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) and/or mass spectrometry (MS). In the case of glycoproteins, the N-glycans can be selectively released enzymatically or chemically, separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, and are often sequenced online by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with or without exoglycosidase treatments.""
 'Schematic examples of modular glycosyltransferases. GT family modules are shown in red and blue. Other modules in various colors are CBM13, ricin-like carbohydrate-binding module; SH3, src homology domain 3; X84, putative glycan-binding module; PBP, penicillin-binding (more...) Other modular GTs can feature an appended GBP domain. The best-known examples are polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs; GALNT) that transfer N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to Ser or Thr residues (Chapters 6 and 10). In these enzymes, a GT27 catalytic domain is linked to a GBP domain related to ricin and classified as CBM13 in the CAZy database. The GBP domain binds to the GalNAc residue transferred to protein by the GT27 catalytic domain and tethers the enzyme to the substrate. Another example is mouse polypeptide β-xylosyltransferase 2, in which a GT14 catalytic domain is linked to a carboxy-terminal domain that is thought to act as a GBP. The GHs can also be modular, with the catalytic domain appended to one or more other modules whose role is to bind polysaccharides. Although human GHs are infrequently modular, those of microbes involved in plant cell-wall degradation can have more than five different modules assembled in a single polypeptide. Human acidic chitinase is an example of a mammalian modular GH having a CBM14 domain appended at the carboxyl terminus of the GH18 catalytic domain. The most intricate architecture of GHs is found in certain bacteria, such as Clostridium thermocellum, which elaborate a macromolecular complex called a “cellulosome” in which a large variety of modular plant cell-wall hydrolases are assembled together on a scaffolding protein. This strategy enables the assembly of dozens of catalytic modules simultaneously targeting the various polysaccharides that make up the plant cell wall. In summary, the genome, comprising the DNA of an organism, includes all the genes that produce the glycome, which comprises all of the glycans made by an organism. Although, within an organism, almost every cell that contains a nucleus and mitochondria has an identical genome; cells typically differ in the portion of the genome and, therefore the glycome, they express. Thus, the glycan complement of a cell depends on which genes are actively transcribed and which transcripts are translated and stably expressed. Transcription, splicing, translation, and posttranslational processing may vary depending on the state of differentiation and the physiological environment of a cell. Therefore, during development and differentiation, and under different environmental conditions, the glycan repertoire of a cell represents a subset of all the glycans that an organism is capable of making. To describe this variation, it is common to qualify the term glycome when referring to the glycans made by a particular tissue or cell type (e.g., T-cell glycome, hepatocyte glycome, or serum glycome), and to note the particular stage of development (e.g., fetal liver glycome, breast cancer serum glycome). The glycome of a given cell in an organism can undergo substantial changes in response to environmental stimuli ranging from pH and ionic strength to hormonal stimulation or inflammation. Combined with the “assembly-line” nature of the Golgi apparatus (Chapter 4) and potential remodeling by GHs, full knowledge of the GT and GH transcriptome is only a rough predictor of the actual glycome of a given cell type, albeit a very helpful one. Apart from transcriptional control, the glycome is regulated by posttranscriptional control by microRNAs (miRs). For example, GALNT7 is a target of miR-30d, a microRNA that is known to promote melanoma metastasis in patients and mouse models. The down-regulation of GALNT7 phenocopied the expression of miR-30d. Subsequently, miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of the glycome owing to their ability to regulate multiple GT and GH mRNA targets. Nearly 80 GT and GH genes have been identified as targets of miRNAs to date. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Kelley Moremen and Tadashi Suzuki.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.4 Karen J. Colley, Ajit Varki, Robert S. Haltiwanger, and Taroh Kinoshita. This chapter provides an overview of glycosylation from the perspective of a single cell, taking into account the patterns of expression, topology, and other features of the biosynthetic and degradative enzymes that are common to most cell types. The focus is mostly on the organization of glycosylation in eukaryotic cells. Chapters 21 and 22 further address prokaryotic glycosylation mechanisms. After more than three billion years of evolution, every free-living cell and every cell type within eukaryotic organisms remains covered with a dense and complex layer of glycans (Chapter 20). Even enveloped viruses that bud from infected cells carry with them the glycosylation patterns of the host. Additionally, most secreted molecules are glycosylated and extracellular matrices of multicellular organisms are rich in glycans and glycoconjugates. Matrices secreted by unicellular organisms when they congregate (e.g., bacterial biofilms [Chapter 21]) also contain glycans. Thus, evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu. Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms. They then make their way via an intermediate compartment (IC) through multiple stacks of the Golgi apparatus, finally being distributed to various destinations from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Secretory pathway proteins can be N-glycosylated, O-glycosylated, and/or modified with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, and some called proteoglycans are modified with attached glycosaminoglycan chains. The enzymes involved in each of these modification pathways are distinct. N-linked glycans and GPI anchors are preassembled before being transferred to proteins and then further modified in the ER–Golgi pathway. The stepwise assembly of O-linked glycans and glycosaminoglycans, as well as the glycosylation of lipids, involve reactions in both the ER and Golgi (Chapters 9–13 and 17). Figure 4.1 superficially depicts some steps in the synthesis of the major glycan classes in the ER–Golgi pathway of animal cells. Initiation and maturation of the major types of eukaryotic glycoconjugates in relation to subcellular trafficking in the ER–Golgi–plasma membrane pathway.']","These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher.","These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher. The systems-level analysis of all proteins expressed by cells, tissues, or organisms is known as “proteomics.” The proteome, like the transcriptome, but unlike the DNA sequence of the genome, is fundamentally dynamic. The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle. As cells receive external and internal cues in the form of growth factors, hormones, metabolites, or cell–cell interactions, the expression of various genes is modulated and may be transcribed at levels ranging from silence to more than 104 mRNA copies per cell and 107 protein molecules per cell. Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation. However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome.",1.0,0.5769797032075962,0.8780211670196326,0.0072992700729927005,0.99999999998,0.875

To address this problem a number of international efforts are underway to establish standards for the presentation of glycomics data to facilitate data comparison, exchange, and verification. The Glycomics Ontology (GlycO) was the first ontology developed to provide standard terminologies for representing experimentally verified glycan structures as collections of chemically and contextually defined constituents, facilitating the association of these structural elements with biosynthetic and functional processes.","['In this regard, GlyGen retrieves carbohydrate- and glycoconjugate-related data from several international data sources and integrates and harmonizes them. A user-friendly Web portal allows this information, including key associations of diverse data types, to be queried, browsed, displayed, and downloaded. GlyCosmos includes data previously collected by the Japan Consortium for Glycobiology and Glycotechnology Database (JCGGDB). This encompasses experimentally verified MS data, lectin affinity data, glycoprotein data, and glyco-gene information. For example, activity data about glycogenes such as glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotide transporters from the GlycoGene Database (GGDB) have been integrated with KEGG Orthologs and are further linked with glycan structure (GlyTouCan) and disease information (OMIM). Pathways in which glycoproteins are involved are also integrated and can be cross-searched using the main GlyCosmos search form. Glycomics@Expasy aims to host and interconnect available resources to reflect the diversity of glyco-related interactions at the cell surface. The collection is organized around GlyConnect (glycoproteins) and UniLectin (glycan-binding proteins). It also provides tools to support data interpretation such as Compozitor that maps glycomes at any level (site, protein, cell, tissue) into interactive graphs. Whereas the above resources are portals that query other data resources, additional unique, broadly useful data sets and webtools are available at Glycomics@Expasy, GLYCOSCIENCES.de, the Asian Community of Glycoscience and Glycotechnology database (ACGG), and the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) websites. Additional resources have curated non-mammalian glycan information (e.g., CSDB), lectin binding data (e.g., UniLectin, SugarBind), and enzyme data (e.g., CAZy, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG] GLYCAN). Data on the sites of addition of single O-GlcNAc to Ser/Thr on nuclear/cytoplasmic proteins is now being incorporated into the general glycoprotein databases. Table 52.1 provides a more detailed description of the currently (in 2021) active individual database resources. Note that there is no certainty that all cited databases and tools in this chapter will be active over time. Maintenance and quality of databases and software are dependent on secure, funded, and curated input which has been historically not continuous. Glycoscience databases, repositories and web portals  A critical component of glycoinformatics is the availability of standardized approaches to share data and tools. To address this problem a number of international efforts are underway to establish standards for the presentation of glycomics data to facilitate data comparison, exchange, and verification. The Glycomics Ontology (GlycO) was the first ontology developed to provide standard terminologies for representing experimentally verified glycan structures as collections of chemically and contextually defined constituents, facilitating the association of these structural elements with biosynthetic and functional processes. Another effort, GlycoRDF, is a proposed standard ontology for glycan and related metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide consistent terminologies for representing glycan sequences, related biological sources, publications, and experimental data on the Semantic Web. GlycoRDF is now being used by several glycomics database providers, to enable large-scale integration of diverse data collections in the glycosciences. For example, GlyTouCan uses the GlycoRDF ontology to represent the registered data such that other data resources also using this ontology can be integrated and queried by glycan structure. Different information resources (e.g., databases and publications) can reference these identifiers, thus facilitating identification and interpretation of diverse but complementary data sets that embody information about specific glycan structures. The Semantic Web is a new technology that provides a framework for making data available directly on the Internet, provided with semantics, such that inferences can be made automatically based on the data. For example, a researcher often refers to various publications to derive a new hypothesis to test. Using the Semantic Web, the data in the publications would be formatted in such a way (using predefined vocabulary, or ontologies) that the meaning behind the data is preserved in a computable form, on the Web.'
 ""The critical role of glycomics in systems biology. Glycan structures have no template from which to be predicted, are regulated by cellular metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and modify both proteins and lipids. Glycomics thus requires the tools (more...) Because of this biosynthetic and structural complexity, it is not currently possible to accurately predict the structures of the glycans that an organism can produce under different environments or how these glycans are conjugated with other molecules, armed only with knowledge of the genome or proteome. Rather, the identity of each glycan in a biological sample must be identified using analytical methods (Chapter 50 and Chapter 51) that are sufficiently sophisticated to detect and discern the glycan's diverse structural features. Thus, research aimed at understanding the biological roles and consequences of glycan structures depends on the availability of integrated glycoinformatics databases. A consortium of international scientists under the GlySpace Alliance have made considerable progress in this area in recent years to streamline the annotation of glycans and related expression patterns such that they can be linked across diverse databases. Thus, a clearer path from glycan structure to biosynthetic pathways is beginning to emerge from these efforts. Interpreting glycan structural information in the context of diverse types of biological and chemical information is a challenge. For example, most glycans in animals are covalently linked to proteins or lipids. The glycan moieties of a glycoprotein are linked to specific amino acids (usually asparagine, serine, or threonine) (Chapters 9 and 10). Which sites are glycosylated and which structures are present at a particular site often vary, depending on many factors, including the type, developmental stage, and disease state of the cell or tissue. Collection, storage, and retrieval of a description of each protein's glycosylation is time-, tissue-, organism-, interaction-, and disease-dependent and thus presents a major challenge to bioinformaticians working in the glycosciences (glycoinformaticians) as it requires integration of conceptually diverse information. Moreover, many different types of digital tools are necessary, ranging from basic visualization software to software that assists in the interpretation and structural annotation of glycoanalytical data (e.g., mass spectra), to algorithms that identify correlations between glycosylation and other biological phenomena (e.g., gene expression, cell differentiation, disease). A major challenge facing the glycoinformatician is the representation of the information that is processed and produced by these software tools in ways that are conceptually accessible to scientists who do not have an extensive background in glycobiology. Glycoinformatics enables the development of streamlined data reporting and sharing standards. For glycoproteins, the structures of both the glycan and the protein must be represented along with the relationship between these two entities (e.g., the identity of the glycosylation site and the fraction of the protein molecules that bear the glycan in each physiological state). To make this information relevant, the scientist often requires explicit information about the biological context (e.g., tissue and disease state) corresponding to the specified glycosylation or describing how the glycosylation changes when the tissue or cell is perturbed. The glycoscience community is building on the efforts of the Human Proteome Organization-Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to develop similar resources that describe the information that should be included when reporting experimental data, with digital data exchange formats to facilitate communication of structural and biological information and controlled vocabularies that allow the data that is exchanged to be unambiguously interpreted. For example, the Minimum Information Required for A Glycomics Experiment (MIRAGE) initiative is modeled after the well-established Minimum Information for A Proteomics Experiment (MIAPE) initiative of HUPO-PSI. These standards are required for the emergence of glycobiology as a mature discipline that is accessible to the scientific community as a whole. A major component of databases is the standardized depiction of the glycan structures. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) (see Online Appendix 1B) universal symbol nomenclature for the graphical representation of glycan structures has been developed to facilitate such standardization and is used throughout this book. Online Appendix 52A lists current databases and journal publishers that have thus far accepted or strongly recommend the use of this nomenclature.""
 'The Semantic Web is a new technology that provides a framework for making data available directly on the Internet, provided with semantics, such that inferences can be made automatically based on the data. For example, a researcher often refers to various publications to derive a new hypothesis to test. Using the Semantic Web, the data in the publications would be formatted in such a way (using predefined vocabulary, or ontologies) that the meaning behind the data is preserved in a computable form, on the Web. Because a common vocabulary, or ontology, would be used across different publications in different websites (i.e., journals), the terminology used to encapsulate the semantics is preserved. Therefore, the Semantic Web becomes a virtual online database in which all linked data can be queried directly, without any need to transfer large amounts of data. Moreover, with such data available on the Semantic Web, machine learning technologies allow computers to make inferences based on the data available, just as a researcher would think of new hypotheses. The essential accurate interpretation of glycoanalytical data for glycan structure determination requires well-documented metadata, including the parameters used to acquire and process the raw data along with supporting biological source information for the sample being analyzed. The MIRAGE initiative was formed to develop guidelines for researchers to report the qualitative and quantitative results obtained by diverse types of glycomics analyses (e.g., chromatography, mass spectrometry, and glycan/lectin arrays). In an effort to allow glycan data to be shared seamlessly among glycan resources, GlyTouCan has been established as a stable repository and registry of chemically valid glycan structures. For each glycan, it provides unique accession numbers that are now used by diverse glycobiology data systems so that information on the glycan can be linked across databases. These unique GlyTouCan identifiers thus provide the foundation for linking glycan-related knowledge to the Semantic Web. The initial dataset of GlyTouCan structures comes from GlycomeDB, an undertaking that consolidated structures from a number of established glycan structure databases including CarbBank and provided links to the original sources. Registered users can submit any glycan structure whether they are fully defined, contain ambiguous linkages, or are simply monosaccharide compositions, independent of experimental evidence. All structures registered in GlyTouCan are checked only for representational and chemical consistency and not for biological relevance. Thus, databases that leverage GlyTouCan structural representations still require improved methods for establishing and validating the biological context of these structures. This registry facilitates the interpretation of results in the context of structural and biological information that is available from other sources. Nevertheless, the meaningful comparison of incompletely defined structures in terms of sequence, linkage, and anomericity remains an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. It should be noted that, because of the reliance on analytical structure determination, a limitation for a majority of databases is the number of fully characterized entries (i.e., defined linkages and anomeric configurations between monosaccharides). For example, less than 15,000 out of the 40,000 structures in the amalgamated GlycomeDB are fully defined. These unique identifiers, however, provide the semantic foundation required for individuals or databases to effectively communicate by recording the identifier of the structures they have characterized. Many advances in glyco-related databases and informatics tools development have focused on the interpretation and storage of analytical data, including liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), interaction arrays, mass spectrometry (MS), and three-dimensional (3D)/modeling/nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table 52.2). Glycoinformatics data analysis software tools  Most efforts so far have focused on tools that assist the interpretation of MS data. A number of commercial and publicly accessible software are now available. Introduced in 1999, the widely used GlycoMod was the first glycoinformatics Web-based tool to be released in this context, and its function is to suggest possible glycan compositions from experimental mass values of either free or derivatized glycans or glycopeptides. The Glycosciences.de portal started a toolset for analyzing and interpreting experimental data, and a decade later, the EUROCarbDB initiative launched GlycoWorkbench as a freely downloadable software tool to assist the interpretation of MS/MS data by matching a theoretical list of fragment masses against the experimental peak list derived from the mass spectrum.'
 'Indeed, 50 years after the advent of sequencing technology, DNA sequences, along with their links to other data types (gene expression, protein structure, etc.), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates. The advancement of glycoscience as a discipline depends on expanding the integration of data describing glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, lipopolysaccharides, and the genome-coded enzymatic machinery that generates or breaks down these glycans, together with the ever-increasing information about the interactions of these glycoconjugates with other components of the cell. It is the ultimate goal of glycoscience research to be able to link glycan structures with their function. Although it is still difficult to completely identify fully defined glycan structures on their conjugates in a high-throughput manner, various hypotheses regarding the relationships between the specific structure of a glycan and its biological functions have been developed. One hypothesis maintains that the structural features characteristic of a group of glycans, rather than of a single structure, are required for biological function. This hypothesis is possible but is unlikely to be valid in all cases, as many discrete glycans are known to have quite specific functions, and changing a single monosaccharide or glycosidic conformation can greatly affect their capacity to realize their functions. Thus, additional work is required to accumulate as much of the experimental glycomics data as possible into standardized formats, such that comprehensive, integrated analyses can be performed using bioinformatics technologies. The future of current endeavors in glyco-related informatics lies in the consolidation of international consortia. The small size of the glycoscience community has prompted several cooperative initiatives across all continents for representing and collecting glycomics data (as described above). To favor interactions between these complementary initiatives, the international Glycome Informatics Consortium (GLIC) was founded in 2015 to provide and maintain a centralized software resource for developers, thus enabling cooperative database and tool development. Also in 2015, a Glycomics section was established on the Swiss Institute For Bioinformatics (SIB) Expasy proteomics resource portal, and glycoprotein entries in UniProtKB have been also linked to glycan structural information, when known, in GlyGen and GlyConnect. In addition, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the Common Fund Glycoscience Program is now focused on creating new methodologies and resources to study glycans that include the development of data integration and analysis tools. In 2018, the GlySpace Alliance (glyspace.org) was formed for further standardization and collaboration between glycan database portals. This alliance consists of GlyGen, funded by the U.S. NIH Common Fund, GlyCosmos funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency–National Bioscience Database Center, and Glycomics@Expasy of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Ensuring that all data is available under a completely open license while providing the provenance of all data, sharing all data between resources, and quality-checking all data are the key goals of this alliance. These international efforts are affirmation that the importance of bioinformatics resources for glycoscience is finally being recognized, such that the role of glycans may be more easily understood and accessed by the broader research community. However it is clear that there is a long way to go before the entire community can have routine access to what aficionados of nucleic acid and protein biology currently take for granted: reliable, well-curated, user-friendly, cross-referenced databases that are permanently and safely housed in major long-term government-funded central servers. Achievement of this goal will be critical to bringing the study of glycans into the mainstream of evolutionary, molecular, and cellular biology, and its applications to medicine, materials science, and other fields that benefit humankind. The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Ram Sasisekharan and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Manfred Wuhrer.'
 ""Because of their inherent flexibility, oligosaccharides typically exist in solution or on proteins, as an ensemble of conformations, making it a challenge to describe their 3D structure (see Chapters 30 and 50 for a description of 3D structures). Computational chemistry is an essential tool in analyzing glycan experimental data, to make predictions that may be tested experimentally, and to unravel and explain chemical processes at the atomic level. Web-based tools are available to generate a theoretical model of a carbohydrate 3D structure. A useful resource is GLYCAM-Web that provides tools for modeling oligosaccharides and glycoproteins in addition to providing downloadable structure files that can be used for molecular modeling. SWEET-II is also a carbohydrate 3D builder that is available on the GLYCOSCIENCES.de website. The two major databases for storing experimentally determined 3D carbohydrate structures are the PDB and the Cambridge Structural Database. Crystal structures of oligosaccharides are also available at Glyco3D. A recent extension of the latter is GAG-DB, centered on the 3D description of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Most of the carbohydrates in the PDB are either connected covalently to a glycoprotein or form a complex with a lectin, enzyme, or antibody. Recently, the PDB has undergone a carbohydrate remediation, ensuring that carbohydrates are accurately annotated. Therefore PDB entries now contain glycan annotations, which are available in LINUCS, GLYCAM (IUPAC-like), and WURCS formats. Despite the known sequon (NXT/S, X is not Pro) for N-linked glycosylation, many potential sites are not glycosylated in vivo, and there are no clear motif(s) for predicting O-linked glycosylation. Understanding the “rules'' of attachment site specificity for the glycosylation of proteins is thus an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. Over the past 20 years, neural networks, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been implemented to predict N- or O-glycosylation and C-mannosylation. Although the original tools were hosted on the Danish CBS Prediction Servers, additional resources have emerged in the last few years. Glycoprotein informatic resources of GlyGen, GlyCosmos, and Glycomics@Expasy now provide information on the glycan structures as attached to proteins in a complementary manner. The coverage and content depend on both automated and manual efforts to mine or curate current literature that contains characterized glycan structures and their sites of attachment to proteins and on supporting data from experimental conditions and biological sources. This collaborative, international bioinformatic integration of complex molecular data from all types of glycoanalytical techniques and interactions is in constant development and is essential for the continued progress of glycobiological research. Systems biology involves the development, simulation, and analysis of biological systems (including whole-body and environmental systems) at the molecular and cellular levels. As research on glycan biosynthetic pathway simulation progresses, its integration with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics data represents the next step. This will result in a holistic understanding of biological processes (Figure 52.1), such that glycomics data can be viewed in the context of complementary data. Such integrated knowledge will result in better elucidation of the glycosylation process, reveal new interactions with GBPs, and enhance our understanding of related functional consequences. The current coordinated trend toward RDF-based data integration is already shaping future developments of glycoscience databases. It will help bridge the gap between glycomics and other -omics that have already adopted RDF ontologies but that are still very much DNA sequence–centered. Indeed, 50 years after the advent of sequencing technology, DNA sequences, along with their links to other data types (gene expression, protein structure, etc.), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates.""]","Another effort, GlycoRDF, is a proposed standard ontology for glycan and related metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide consistent terminologies for representing glycan sequences, related biological sources, publications, and experimental data on the Semantic Web.

GlycoRDF is now being used by several glycomics database providers, to enable large-scale integration of diverse data collections in the glycosciences. For example, GlyTouCan uses the GlycoRDF ontology to represent the registered data such that other data resources also using this ontology can be integrated and queried by glycan structure. Different information resources (e.g., databases and publications) can reference these identifiers, thus facilitating identification and interpretation of diverse but complementary data sets that embody information about specific glycan structures. The Semantic Web is a new technology that provides a framework for making data available directly on the Internet, provided with semantics, such that inferences can be made automatically based on the data. For example, a researcher often refers to various publications to derive a new hypothesis to test. Using the Semantic Web, the data in the publications would be formatted in such a way (using predefined vocabulary, or ontologies) that the meaning behind the data is preserved in a computable form, on the Web. Because a common vocabulary, or ontology, would be used across different publications in different websites (i.e., journals), the terminology used to encapsulate the semantics is preserved.",0.5,0.4964178989015261,0.8920235322676233,0.008264462809917356,0.99999999998,1.0

Pure glycans of defined structure are essential research tools in glycobiology. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, which can be obtained in homogeneous forms by recombinant expression and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, glycans produced in biological systems are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the quantities that can be obtained from biological systems are often small. Chemical synthesis can be used to obtain homogeneous glycans in larger quantities than are available from most cellular production systems. Chemical synthesis can be further employed to incorporate glycans into homogeneous glycoproteins. This chapter summarizes the current state of the art in chemical methods to produce glycans. Enzymes can be used together with chemical methods to prepare diverse glycans (Chapter 54). The structure of oligosaccharides render their synthesis more complicated than the synthesis of the other major classes of biomolecules: oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11). The choice of protecting groups and the order of protecting group installation are essential for a successful synthetic route. The most common protecting groups include benzyl ethers that stay in place through many synthetic steps (permanent protecting groups) or carbonates and esters that are removed during intermediate steps in a synthesis (temporary protecting groups). A wealth of information exists on the chemical generation of glycans and various protecting group manipulations used in the context of glycan synthesis. A glycosidic linkage is generally formed through the activation of a glycosylating agent (glycosyl donor) to create an electrophilic species that reacts with the nucleophile, for example, a hydroxyl group present on the glycosyl acceptor. Other possible acceptors include serine/threonine in the case of glycopeptides or a sphingoid in the case of glycosphingolipids. The glycosylation reaction results in the formation of either an α- or β-glycosidic linkage (see Chapter 2). A major challenge in glycan synthesis is the stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds (Figure 53.1A; Chapter 2). A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages. The yield and the stereochemical outcome of these reactions depend on the steric and electronic nature of the glycosylating agent (the glycosyl donor), the nature of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions. One common method to control the stereochemistry at the anomeric center involves the use of certain protecting groups, such as esters or amides/carbamates, on the C2-hydroxyl or C2-amino group (Figure 53.1B).'
 'Two annotated and searchable databases for O-GlcNAcylated (OGN) proteins have been established, which currently list nearly 8,000 OGN proteins in human cells. The CAZy database (www.cazy.org) of carbohydrate-active enzymes has also played an important role in advancing the field. The overall goal is to coordinate all of these efforts into bioinformatic databases that a nonexpert can explore in a manner similar to current resources for DNA, RNA, and proteins. The combination of organic synthesis and chemoenzymatic synthesis will allow the production of well-defined glycan arrays that contain the various binding epitopes for glycan-binding proteins. Recombinant glycosyltransferases will become common tools to generate specific glycans on glycoproteins and living cells, and these enzymes will greatly enhance the many studies that now rely on the use of lectins (Chapter 48), whose specificity is often not well-defined. Finally, the rapidly expanding analytical toolkit will be instrumental to decipher the regulatory mechanisms that mediate homeostasis of glycoconjugates at a cellular level. As with analytical methods, it is also important to “democratize” the approaches by developing simple methods for the average biologist working at the bench. In recent years, great advancements in the glycomic profiling of glycans from cells, tissues, or organisms have occurred. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has allowed the rapid profiling of the majority of N- and O-glycans in a sample (Chapter 51). As matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) instruments also gain the ability to perform tandem mass spectrometry, confidence in the structure of profiled glycans will continue to improve. However, detailed structural analysis of individual glycans still remains a low-throughput method that requires considerable expertise and expensive instrumentation. The development of glycan arrays presenting hundreds of different glycans of defined structure is perhaps one of the most impactful recent developments in glycobiology (Chapter 56). These arrays have allowed for rapid, high-throughput analysis of the binding specificities of numerous biologically important glycan-binding proteins, including lectins, antibodies, viruses, and bacteria. It has been estimated that these arrays will need to contain between 10,000 and 20,000 different glycans to cover most possible glycotopes (this highly conservative estimate does not take into account various common and labile modifications of glycans). In addition, more specialized arrays will be required to study glycan-binding proteins made by prokaryotes or to study proteins that bind to glycosaminoglycans, for example. Fortunately, the ability to make such large and diverse glycan arrays is on the horizon, and the remaining challenge will be to better understand the parameters of the glycan arrays, besides the glycans themselves, that influence binding, such as linkers, spacing, and density of glycans on solid supports. Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states. Significant progress has also been made in Systems Glycobiology by better integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Our understanding as to how miRNAs and transcription factors regulate glycan expression has also improved in the last few years (Chapters 51 and 52). At the present time, the study of glycan structure/function relationships requires highly specialized expertise in synthetic and analytical chemistry. The inherent difficulty in studying glycans remains a major challenge preventing glycobiology—the study of glycan function—from entering mainstream conceptual frameworks of biology. In response to this challenge, strong emphasis has recently been placed on the development of facile technologies that will allow nonglycobiologists without specialized analytical chemistry skills to study glycans in a meaningful way. In fact, the use of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase probes to manipulate glycans is not any more difficult than the use of restriction enzymes and endonucleases to analyze DNA. The use of antibodies and lectins specific for glycans also exemplifies methods that can be readily applied by biologists lacking expensive analytical equipment or extensive glycobiology expertise (Chapter 49). In fact, several kits for the study of glycans have emerged, as companies recognize the future market potential of glycobiology.'
 'The final complete degradation of most eukaryotic glycans is generally performed by multiple glycosidases in the lysosome. Once degraded, their individual unit monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytosol for reuse (Figure 1.8). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, the O-GlcNAc monosaccharide modifications of the nucleus and cytoplasm appear more dynamic (Chapter 19). In some instances, extracellular or intracellular free glycans can also serve as signaling molecules (Chapter 40). Biosynthesis, use, and turnover of a common monosaccharide. This schematic shows the biosynthesis, fate, and turnover of galactose, a common monosaccharide constituent of animal glycans. Although small amounts of galactose can be taken up from the outside (more...) Unlike oligonucleotides and proteins, glycans are not commonly found in a linear, unbranched fashion. Even when linear (e.g., GAGs), they often contain a variety of substituents, such as sulfate groups, which are not uniformly distributed. Thus, complete sequencing of glycans is usually impossible by a single method and requires iterative combinations of physical, chemical, and enzymatic approaches that together yield the details of structure (for a discussion of low- and high-resolution separation and analysis, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR], see Chapter 50). Less detailed information on structure may be sufficient to explore the biology of some glycans and can be obtained by simple techniques, such as the use of enzymes (endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases), lectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 48 and 50), chemical modification or cleavage, metabolic radioactive labeling, antibodies, or cloned glycosyltransferases (Chapters 53 and 54). Glycosylation can also be perturbed in various ways, for example, by glycosylation inhibitors and primers (Chapters 55 and 56) and by genetic manipulation of glycosylation in intact cells and organisms (Chapter 49). Directed in vitro synthesis of glycans by chemical and enzymatic methods has also made great strides in recent years, providing many new tools for exploring glycobiology (Chapters 53, 54, and 57). The generation of complex glycan libraries by a variety of routes has further enhanced this interface of chemistry and biology (Chapters 53 and 54), including the generation of glycan microarrays. Analogous to genomics and proteomics, glycomics represents the systematic methodological elucidation of the “glycome” (the totality of glycan structures) of a given cell type or organism (Chapters 51 and 52). In reality, the glycome is far more complex than the genome or proteome. In addition to the vastly greater structural diversity in glycans, one is faced with the complexities of glycosylation microheterogeneity (see above) and the dynamic changes that occur in the course of development, differentiation, metabolic changes, aging, malignancy, inflammation, or infection. Added diversity arises from intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation. Thus, a given cell type in a given species can manifest a large number of possible glycome states. Glycomic analysis today generally consists of extracting entire cell types, organs, or organisms; releasing all the glycan chains from their linkages; and cataloging them via approaches such as mass spectrometry. In a variation called glycoproteomics, the glycans are analyzed while still attached to protease-generated fragments of glycoproteins. The results obtained represent a spectacular improvement over what was possible a few decades ago, but they are still analogous to cutting down all the trees in a forest and cataloging them, without attention to the layout of the forest and the landscape (Chapter 15 discusses this complex issue from the perspective of just one monosaccharide class, sialic acids; see Figure 15.3). Glycomic analysis thus needs to be complemented by classical methods such as tissue-section staining or flow cytometry, using lectins or glycan-specific antibodies that aid in understanding the glycome by taking into account the heterogeneity of glycosylation at the level of the different cell types and subcellular domains in the tissue under study.'
 'Paper, textiles, cellophane, and rayon are other examples of everyday materials made from glycans. As our supply of petroleum runs out, glycans will increasingly be used to provide materials for the manufacture of plastics and a myriad of polymers (Chapter 59). Various forms of modified cellulose, for example, will be critical for the manufacturing of exotic materials and as carbon sources for various chemicals. Advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation and methods in recent years have been remarkable (Chapters 50 and 51). The ability to use mass spectrometry to map glycan attachment sites, to profile glycan structural variations, and to determine detailed fine structures of glycans has progressed rapidly because of technological advances in instrumentation, including electron capture and electron transfer dissociation fragmentation methods, and the development of ion traps with very high mass accuracy and sensitivity. In the future, ion-mobility separations in the gas phase will allow the identification of glycan isomers that have identical molecular masses in mixtures. In addition, there have been major advances in the chromatographic isolation and separation of complex glycans. New ultra-high-pressure pumps and very small particulate high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) resins that can withstand high pressures will also greatly increase the resolving power of chromatography. Advances in ion mobility and high-resolution mass spectrometric methods are, for the first time, allowing us to begin to decode the information content of glycosaminoglycans (Chapter 17). The development of induced hyperpolarization methods shows great promise in greatly increasing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of glycans (Chapter 50), which has been a major limitation in the analyses of biological samples. Recent advances in solution NMR spectroscopy that allows measurements of NOEs between OH groups have increased the number of distance restraints and improve the quality of glycan three-dimensional structures (Chapter 50). Bio-orthogonal labeling methods continue to be developed that will allow the study of changes in glycans in living cells in real time. Currently, for atomic structural analyses of glycoproteins, including X-ray crystallography, it is usually necessary to remove glycans to allow for crystallization. As electron imaging methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), continue to reach higher resolution approaching that achieved by crystallographic analyses, we will be able to obtain images of glycoconjugates at atomic resolution, without the need to remove the glycans. In fact, recent cryo-EM structures of the oligosaccharyltransferases have significantly impacted our molecular understanding of N-linked glycosylation. As NMR becomes more sensitive and can handle larger molecules, one will also be able to visualize glycoconjugates in physiologically relevant solvents and at appropriate temperatures. These developments will allow a much more accurate view of the 3D structures of glycoconjugates. Eventually, one will need to define the population of molecular species (glycoforms of glycoproteins and glycolipids) at an organismal and cellular level to fully understand structure/function relationships of glycoconjugates in response to extracellular stimuli. Existing technologies that show great promise include top-down glycoproteomics and high-throughput, high-resolution imaging methods. In the past few years, there have also been major advances in glycoproteomics. In contrast to glycomics, glycoproteomic approaches do not lose the context of where on a polypeptide glycans are attached (Chapter 51). In theory, if these methods live up to their promise, one day it may be possible to define the complete set of molecular species of glycoconjugates in a population and thus elucidate how they collectively contribute to the many individual functions of a gene product. However, all these methods still result in loss of information about labile modifications of glycans and also involve breaking apart the intact glycome into pieces before analysis. Ultimately, one will need to understand the actual structure of the intact glycome in situ in living systems. In parallel with advances in such sophisticated methods, it is also important to “democratize” the practical approach to glycobiology by developing simple methods that can be used by the average biologist working at the bench without sophisticated instrumentation. The NIH Common Fund has recently supported research designed to make the study of glycosciences more accessible to biologists and biochemists not in the field.'
 'Some functions of glycans are discovered serendipitously. In other instances, the investigator who has elucidated complete details of the structure and biosynthesis of a specific glycan is left without knowing its functions. It is necessary to design experiments that can differentiate between trivial and crucial functions mediated by each glycan. Various approaches are discussed below, emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach (also presented in schematic form in Figure 7.2). Approaches for elucidating the biological functions of glycans. The figure assumes that a specific biological role is being mediated by recognition of a certain glycan structure by a specific glycan-binding protein. Clues to this biological role could (more...) Many current approaches to understanding glycan diversity (Chapters 50 and 51) involve extraction and identification of the entire complement of glycans found in a given organ or tissue, without regard to the fact that individual cell types and even basal versus apical sides of the same cell can have widely varying glycan expression patterns. However, cell type–specific localization of glycans can be explored using highly specific GRPs (GBPs or antibodies, see Chapter 48). Once a specific glycan has been localized in an interesting biological context, it is natural to consider introducing the cognate GRP into the intact system, hoping to interfere with a specific function and generate an interpretable phenotype. Such an approach is likely to give confusing results with regard to glycan function. Some GRPs (e.g., antibodies against glycans) tend to have weak affinity and show cross-reactivity. Although some plant lectins seem very specific for animal glycans, they often originate from organisms that typically do not contain the same ligand. Thus, their apparent specificity may not be as reliable when introducing them into complex animal biological systems in which they might bind unknown, cross-reacting glycans. Finally, most GRPs are multivalent, and their cognate ligands (the glycans) tend to be present in multiple copies on multiple glycoconjugates. Thus, introduction of a GRP into a complex biological system may cause nonspecific aggregation of various molecules and cell types, and the effects seen may extend well beyond the biological functions of the glycan in question. It would seem worthwhile to develop recombinant monovalent GRP modules that are derived from the same system being investigated, provided they are of high enough affinity. Effects of introducing such monovalent GRPs as competitors of the native function may yield more interpretable clues. Many pharmacological agents can metabolically inhibit or alter glycosylation in intact cells and animals (Chapter 49). Although such agents are powerful tools to elucidate biosynthetic pathways, they can yield confusing results in complex systems. One concern is that an inhibitor may have effects on other unrelated pathways. For example, the bacterial inhibitor tunicamycin that blocks N-linked glycosylation can also cause ER stress and inhibit UDP-Gal uptake into the Golgi. The second concern is that the inhibitor may cause such global changes in glycan synthesis that the physical properties of the glycoconjugates and/or membranes are altered, making it difficult to interpret the results. Somewhat more useful results can be obtained by introducing low-molecular-weight primers of terminal glycosylation (Chapter 55), which can act as alternate substrates for Golgi enzymes, diverting synthesis away from the endogenous glycoproteins. However, this approach can simultaneously generate incomplete glycans on endogenous glycoconjugates, as well as produce secreted glycan chains, each with their own biological effects. Because specific “carbohydrate-recognition domains” can be identified within a primary amino acid sequence (Chapters 28 and 29), it is now possible to predict whether a newly cloned protein can bind glycans. If a potential GBP can be produced in sufficient quantities, techniques such as hemagglutination, flow cytometry, surface plasmon resonance, and affinity chromatography (Chapters 29 and 28) can then be used to search for specific ligands. However, the monovalent affinity of the putative GBP for its ligand may not be high. Thus, high densities and/or multivalent arrays may be needed to avoid missing a biologically relevant interaction. The question also arises as to where exactly to look for the biologically relevant ligands in a complex multicellular system.']","Enzymes can be used together with chemical methods to prepare diverse glycans.

Complete the following paragraph: A demonstration of an endo-hexosaminidase-derived glycosynthase in action is given by the synthesis of Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptide 28 from a glycoprotein from HIV-1. The sequence of steps commences with homogeneous Man9GlcNAc2Asn 24 that can be prepared by exhaustive proteolytic digestion of soybean glycoproteins by pronase.,"['This glycosynthase proved highly flexible with respect to the acceptor phenol, allowing for the construction of a small library of flavonoid glycosides represented by phenolic disaccharide 12. Subsequent enzymatic removal of the nonreducing galactospyranoside provided flavonoid glucoside 13. Glycosynthase-mediated synthesis of flavonoid glycosides.  By combining the strengths of glycosyltransferases, glycosynthases, and chemical synthesis, the total synthesis of ganglioside LLG-3 from the neurogenic starfish was accomplished (Figure 54.7). N-Carboxybenzyl(Cbz)-protected CMP-sialic acid 17 was prepared by first performing a Neu5Ac aldolase-catalyzed aldol reaction of mannosamine derivative 14 and pyruvate 15. The resulting sialic acid derivative 16 was reacted with CTP under the agency of CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase to give donor sialoside 17. In a sialyltransferase-catalyzed reaction, compound 17 was condensed with α-fluorolactoside 10 to give trisaccharide 18, in which the amine was unmasked by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis to give trisaccharide, equipped with an anomeric fluoride for glycosynthesis and an amine for chemical amide bond formation. The sequence commenced by condensation of synthetic sialic acid derivative 20 with the free amine in 19 under amide bond-forming conditions, to give 21. Condensation of tetrasaccharidyl fluoride 21 with the double (E351S/D341Y) mutant of the bacterial endoglycosidase EGCase II gave lysolipid 23 in good yield. The free amine in 23 can be condensed with a fatty acid or alternatively with a fluorescent reporter group. A combined glycosyltransferase/glycosynthase/chemical synthesis of a lysosphingolipid.  Glycosynthases derived from endoglycosidases have been used for the construction of structurally well-defined N-glycoproteins (Figure 54.8). Hexosaminidases, both exo- and endo-types, hydrolyze N-acetylglucosamine-containing glycosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric configuration. In contrast to most other retaining glycosidases, some retaining hexosaminidases do not employ an enzyme active site nucleophile in the nucleophilic displacement of the aglycon, but rather utilize the N-acetyl group in the substrate for this purpose (Figure 54.8, insert). As a result, an intermediate oxazolinium ion intermediate is produced that after nucleophilic attack of water yields the hemiacetal with retention of configuration. Endo-hexosaminidases can be employed in transglycosylation reactions and, in mutant form, as glycosynthases. Glycosynthase mediated synthesis of homogeneous peptide N-glycans.  A demonstration of an endo-hexosaminidase-derived glycosynthase in action is given by the synthesis of Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptide 28 from a glycoprotein from HIV-1. The sequence of steps commences with homogeneous Man9GlcNAc2Asn 24 that can be prepared by exhaustive proteolytic digestion of soybean glycoproteins by pronase. Wild-type endohexosaminidase, Endo-A, recognizes this high-mannose N-glycan and hydrolyses the GlcNAc-GlcNAc glycosidic linkage, to yield Man9GlcNAc 25. After peracetylation, treatment with trimethylsilyl bromide and borontrifluoride etherate, and global deprotection provided oxazolidinium ion 27. This compound is a good substrate for mutant (N175A) endohexosaminidase, endo-M, which was identified by site-directed mutagenesis as a putative glycosynthase activity.'
 'Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water. Although not necessarily relevant for the product formation in nature (sugar hemiacetals being prone to mutarotation at physiological pH), the different mechanisms employed by “retaining glycosidases” (involvement of a covalent intermediate) and “inverting glycosidases” (no covalent intermediate involved) bears consequences for their use in glycan synthesis. The use of Leloir-type glycosyltransferases in glycan synthesis requires access to the natural donor glycosides, which are sugar nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic advantage of glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis (excellent regio- and stereoselectivity) can be offset by the limitation on the access to the required donor glycosides. However, this challenge may be overcome by in situ biosynthesis/regeneration of the consumed sugar nucleotides. The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst. The resulting trisaccharide 3 is further extended with GDP-fucose 4 as the donor and recombinant fucosyltransferase (FucT) as the catalyst to deliver allyl sialyl-Lewis x. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x. (CMP) Cytidine monophosphate, (CDP) cytidine diphosphate, (CTP) cytidine triphosphate.  In the first step of the assembly line, the expensive sugar nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, is consumed, and on transfer of the sialic acid, cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is produced. With the aid of two consecutive kinases (nucleoside monophosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase), CMP can be transformed in situ into the corresponding triphosphate (CTP), which is then condensed by the enzyme CMP-sialic acid synthetase with sialic acid to regenerate CMP-Neu5Ac 2. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides.  The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans.  The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4).'
 'After peracetylation, treatment with trimethylsilyl bromide and borontrifluoride etherate, and global deprotection provided oxazolidinium ion 27. This compound is a good substrate for mutant (N175A) endohexosaminidase, endo-M, which was identified by site-directed mutagenesis as a putative glycosynthase activity. In the final step, the efficacy of the endo-M glycosynthase was demonstrated by the construction of high-mannose N-glycan 28 from 26 and 27. Enzymatic synthesis has proven to be a powerful methodology for the construction of complex glycans. Chemoenzymatic synthesis can be a suitable alternative for chemical synthesis, as demonstrated by the many applications of sialyltransferases for the construction of complicated or intractable sialic acid-containing glycans. The marriage of enzymatic synthesis and chemical synthesis is very promising. The elaboration by means of glycosyltransferases and/or glycosynthases has proven to be a highly effective strategy to prepare large and complex glycans and glycoconjugates. Advances in chemical and enzymatic syntheses provide the means to construct most natural or designed glycans. The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Nathaniel Finney and David Rabuka and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Xi Chen.'
 'In addition, the action of MAN1B1, MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 can all be blocked experimentally by the inhibitors, deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine, resulting in Man8-9GlcNAc2 on mature glycoproteins. Most mature glycoproteins have some oligomannose N-glycans that are not processed in the cis-Golgi. Biosynthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans (Figure 9.1) is initiated in the medial-Golgi by the action of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase called GlcNAc-TI (MGAT1), which adds a GlcNAc residue to the C-2 of the α1-3Man in the core of Man5GlcNAc2 (Figure 9.4). Subsequently, the majority of N-glycans are trimmed by α-mannosidase II enzymes (MAN2A1 or MAN2A2) in the medial-Golgi, which remove the terminal α1-3Man and α1-6Man residues from GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 to form GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2. It is important to note that α-mannosidase II cannot trim Man5GlcNAc2 unless it has been acted on by MGAT1. Once both Man residues are removed, a second GlcNAc is added to the C-2 of the α1-6Man in the N-glycan core by the action of GlcNAc-TII (MGAT2) to yield the precursor for all biantennary, complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans are formed if the GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 glycan produced by MGAT1 is not acted on by α-mannosidase II. Incomplete action of α-mannosidase II can result in GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc2 hybrids. Small oligomannose N-glycans have been found in relatively large amounts in invertebrates and plants. These Man3–4GlcNAc2 N-glycans (paucimannose N-glycans) are formed from GlcNAcMan3–4GlcNAc2 following removal of the peripheral GlcNAc by a Golgi hexosaminidase that acts after α-mannosidase II (Chapters 24 and 26). Paucimannose glycans are also found in mammals, and can be elevated in cancer, inflammation, and stem cell development. The complex N-glycan shown in the medial-Golgi of Figure 9.4 has two antennae or branches initiated by the addition of two GlcNAc residues. Additional branches can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-3Man by GlcNAc-TIV (MGAT4A, MGAT4B, MGAT4C) and at C-6 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TV (MGAT5) to yield tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans (Figure 9.5). MGAT5B or GlcNAc-TIX catalyzes the same reaction but preferentially on O-mannose glycans in brain. Another branch, found in birds and fish, can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TVI (MGAT6; Figure 9.5). Genes related to GlcNAc-TVI exist in mammalian genomes (MGAT4C). Complex and hybrid N-glycans may also carry a “bisecting” GlcNAc residue that is attached to the β-Man of the core by GlcNAc-TIII (MGAT3) (Figure 9.5). A bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary N-glycan is shown in Figure 9.5, and it may be present in all of the more highly branched N-glycans. However, it is not usually extended. Branching and core modification of complex N-glycans.'
 'The incorporation of each monomer relies on an acidic washing step to prevent quenching by any remaining base, followed by the coupling step using 5-6.5 equivalents of building block 12. Next, a capping step prevents any unreacted nucleophiles from engaging in subsequent couplings to produce (n-1)-polysaccharides that are difficult to separate from the desired product. Removal of the temporary Fmoc protecting group exposes the nucleophile for the subsequent coupling step. The 100 coupling cycles were executed automatically within 188 hours and yielded 100-mer α-(1-6) polymannoside 13 after photo-cleavage from the resin and normal-phase HPLC purification (8% overall yield). Cleavage of all ester protective groups by treatment with sodium methoxide, followed by palladium catalyzed hydrogenolysis under pressure to release all benzyl ether protective groups produced 100-mer polymannoside 14 after preparative reverse-phase HPLC. (A) Schematic overview of automated glycan assembly. (B) Automated glycan assembly (AGA) of 100-polymannoside 14. (C) AGA of an alginate dodecasaccharide.  The synthesis of an alginate dodecamer composed of the β-1,4-mannuronate moieties is of note because it required the repetitive installation of cis-glycosidic linkages. The synthesis makes use of immobilized allyl alcohol 15. Reaction with donor mannuronic ester 16 under catalytic amounts of triflic acid (TfOH) yields immobilized monosaccharide 17. Removal of the levulinoyl (Lev) group at O-4 is accomplished by treatment with hydrazine (H2N-NH2) monoacetate, after which the coupling-deprotection sequence is repeated for the desired number of times. Upon completion of the glycan assembly, the fully protected oligosaccharide is removed from the solid support by cross metathesis and subsequent removal of all protecting groups by treatment with strong base and hydrogenolysis. More complex polysaccharides are accessible by block couplings of polysaccharides prepared by AGA. Two polysaccharide blocks, linear 30-mer α-(1-6) polymannoside 21 prepared by AGA from mannose building block 12 and branched 31-mer polymannoside 23 prepared by AGA using 12 and differentially protected mannose building block 22 for the branching positions were unified in a 31+30+30+30+30 coupling to create branched 151-mer 24 that was deprotected to furnish 25 (Figure 53.5). Synthesis of a 151-mer polymannoside by block coupling of polymannosides prepared by automated glycan assembly (AGA).  A database of relative reactivity values (RRVs a number indicating how reactive a glycosyl donor is) of thioglycoside donors has been used to design one-pot glycosylation sequences. Several thioglycosides are combined and selective activation of one of the building blocks over the others can be achieved. The Optimer computer program aids in the selection of the combination of building blocks, equipped with the proper set of protecting groups that tune the reactivity. Figure 53.6 shows the one-pot assembly of the tumor associated N3 antigen octasaccharide using the Optimer approach. Three building blocks were designed and synthesized: fucosyl donor 26 (RRV = 7.2 × 104), lactosamine donor 27 (RRV = 41), and lactose building block 28 (RRV = 0). The latter disaccharides were prepared by chemoselective glycosylations exploiting RRVs. Combination of the first two building blocks in a BSP/Tf2O mediated condensation gave the trisaccharide thioglycoside. Addition of lactose 28 to the reaction vessel and NIS/TfOH to promote the ensuing double glycosylation provided the octasaccharide 29. After deprotection the spacer functionalized octasaccharide 30 was obtained in 11% yield. One-pot synthesis of octasaccharide antigen 32.']","The sequence of steps commences with homogeneous Man9GlcNAc2Asn 24 that can be prepared by exhaustive proteolytic digestion of soybean glycoproteins by pronase. Wild-type endohexosaminidase, Endo-A, recognizes this high-mannose N-glycan and hydrolyses the GlcNAc-GlcNAc glycosidic linkage, to yield Man9GlcNAc 25. After peracetylation, treatment with trimethylsilyl bromide and borontrifluoride etherate, and global deprotection provided oxazolidinium ion 27.

"Complete the following paragraph: Crystal structures for other sialidases have allowed the design of species-specific analogs. This rational approach to inhibitor design holds great potential, not only for neuraminidase inhibitors, but also, as described above, for O-GlcNAcase and OGT inhibitors. These examples illustrate how structure can guide design of carbohydrate-based inhibitors as well as heterocyclic inhibitors that have been more commonly advanced as drugs.","['The higher affinity is presumably due to a salt bridge formed between the charged guanidinium group and the carboxylates lining the pocket. The analog is nearly a million times less potent on human sialidases, leading to its approval and use as the anti-influenza drug Relenza (Chapter 57). It does not work on bacterial sialidases, however, because the equivalent pocket is filled with an arginine group and is only a modest (low-micromolar) inhibitor of the human neuraminidases. Next-generation analogs of Relenza including the close derivative laninamivir as well as the guanidinium-containing peramivir have also been developed. The presence of the guanidinium group requires these drugs to be either inhaled or injected. Subsequent studies focused on dispensing this functionality. Replacement of the pyranose ring with a cyclohexene to mimic the planar ring of the proposed intermediate in hydrolysis, protecting the carboxylate as an ester that is hydrolyzed after ingestion, and replacing the guanidinium with an amine led to an orally active, widely used analog, the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu (Figure 55.6; Chapter 57). Crystal structures for other sialidases have allowed the design of species-specific analogs. This rational approach to inhibitor design holds great potential, not only for neuraminidase inhibitors, but also, as described above, for O-GlcNAcase and OGT inhibitors. These examples illustrate how structure can guide design of carbohydrate-based inhibitors as well as heterocyclic inhibitors that have been more commonly advanced as drugs. These advances have stimulated greater interest into influenza neuraminidase as well as the four human neuraminidases, which have poorly understood physiological roles. A major challenge associated with viral neuraminidase inhibitors—most strikingly, Tamiflu—is the rapid development of mutations that confer resistance. An alternative approach to circumvent this problem has been to develop mechanism-based inhibitors that covalently inhibit the enzyme. One example, FaxGuDFSA, has a fluoride leaving group, the displacement of which by the neuraminidase forms a glycosyl–enzyme intermediate. This intermediate has an appreciable half-life because the electronegative fluorine destabilizes the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state that leads to its breakdown. Accordingly, this compound can protect mice against infection. Moreover, the emergence of resistant influenza strains is slower than against Tamiflu. In addition to driving increased effort against influenza neuraminidase, efforts to create inhibitors of the human neuraminidases have benefited from the fact that DANA and Relenza are modest and nonselective inhibitors of these enzymes. Medicinal chemistry efforts using DANA as a starting point has yielded useful inhibitors for these enzymes by exploiting structural differences in their active sites. One example, C9-4HMT-DANA (Figure 55.6), is the most potent and selective inhibitor of any of these enzymes having an ∼100 nm Ki value and exhibiting 500-fold selectivity over any of the other family members. Doubtless, structures of these human enzymes are likely to accelerate the development of new selective inhibitors. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Manfred Wulhrer.'
 '1,2-Dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NButGT) and the more potent aminothiazoline Thiamet-G are more specific and potent in cells than PUGNAc (Figure 55.3). A rationally designed glucoimidazole, GlcNAcstatin, also potently inhibits O-GlcNAcase with good selectivity over HexA and HexB. These compounds inhibit the enzyme in cells and tissues, and Thiamet-G, in particular, has been used in animal models, providing new tools to study the function of O-GlcNAc. Use of these compounds has uncovered the potential of O-GlcNAcase inhibitors in various neurodegenerative diseases, which has spurred industrial pharmaceutical interest that has led to OGA inhibitors, such as the Thiamet-G analog MK-8719 (Figure 55.3), advancing into Phase I clinical trials. Noncarbohydrate O-GlcNAcase inhibitors have also been uncovered, and highly potent brain permeable analogs have been used as positron emission tomography agents to examine the inhibition and distribution of O-GlcNAcase in human brain. A number of specific glycosyltransferase inhibitors have been developed based on the concept that donor and acceptor substrate analogs might serve as inhibitors. For acceptor substrate analogs, the general strategy is to modify the hydroxyl group that acts as the nucleophile during formation of the glycosidic bond or groups in its immediate vicinity (Table 55.1). Many designer compounds lack inhibitory activity, because modification of the targeted hydroxyl group prevents binding of the analog to the enzyme by interfering with hydrogen bonding networks that position the substrate; that is, these groups serve as “key polar groups.” In a smaller number of cases, the analogs show Ki values in the approximate range of the Km values for the unmodified substrate. As one might expect, the analogs usually act competitively with respect to the unmodified substrate, but in a few cases the inhibition pattern is more complex, suggesting possible binding outside the active site. Synthetic substrate-based inhibitors of glycosyltransferases  Nucleotide sugar analogs provide opportunities for blocking classes of enzymes that use a common donor (e.g., all fucosyltransferases use GDP-fucose). Many nucleotide sugar derivatives have been synthesized (e.g., N- and O-substituted analogs of UDP-GalNAc), and several inhibit the enzymes in vitro. These have proven less useful in living cells because of poor uptake, but there are some notable exceptions, including the fluorescently tagged CMP-NeuAc analog in which the carbohydrate is replaced with an aryl group (1-G-m, Figure 55.1), which has a nanomolar Ki values for a range of sialyltransferases. This compound has also been reported to block sialyltransferases within cells, although this compound has not been more widely adopted by the community. “Bisubstrate” transition-state analogs consist of the nucleoside sugar donor covalently linked to the acceptor substrate by way of a bridging group. In principle, this approach could lead to high-affinity inhibitors, in turn justifying the usually complex routes needed for their synthesis. However, the compounds reported to date have been only modest inhibitors with Ki values, at best, in the range of the Km values for the donors. Although such transition state mimics remain attractive targets, the results to date suggest new features need to be incorporated into their design. Reagents that alter the assembly of glycolipids in cells have been described. Xylosides (Figure 55.1) have a mild effect on glycolipid formation, possibly because of the similarity between xylose and glucose and the assembly of a GM3-like compound (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Xylβ-O-R) on the primer. Because cells take up intermediates in glycolipid biosynthesis, they behave like synthetic glycoside primers. For example, glucosylceramide produces complex glycolipids when fed to cells.'
 'Mannosamine acts as a metabolic inhibitor that inhibits GPI anchor formation both in Trypanosoma brucei and in mammalian cells by the formation of ManNH2-Man-GlcNH2-PI. Apparently, mannosamine in its activated form (GDP-ManNH2) is used as a substrate in the second mannosyltransferase reaction, but the ManNH2-Man-GlcNH2-PI intermediate will not act as a substrate for the next α2-mannosyl-transferase (Chapter 12). GlcNR-phosphatidylinositols with different substituents (R) act as substrate analogs and some act as suicide inhibitors in vitro. Another class of inhibitors is based on fatty acid analogs that only trypanosomes incorporate into GPI anchors. Trypanosomes, unlike their mammalian hosts, incorporate myristic acid into GPI anchors by exchanging myristic acid for other fatty acids in the phosphatidylinositol moiety. By making a series of analogs, an inhibitor was found that is highly toxic to trypanosomes in culture and nontoxic to mammalian cells (10-(propoxy)decanoic acid). Such reagents are drug candidates for treating trypanosomiasis, which is endemic in sub-Saharan regions of Africa. Additional examples of chain terminators have been reported. For example, fluorinated sugar nucleotides (Figure 55.1) are incorporated into growing oligosaccharides by carbohydrate polymerases, but the resulting products lack the hydroxyl group to enable further polymerization. The increasing number of X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM investigations of carbohydrate processing enzymes has provided structural information that has facilitated the rational design of new inhibitors, often with very high potency. These compounds have been used as research tools and some have also advanced to clinically used drugs. Studies of influenza neuraminidase exemplify the power of rationally designed drugs that have successfully been marketed as drugs. The crystal structure for influenza neuraminidase was obtained in 1983, and many other enzymes have since been characterized from other sources. Even before the crystal structure had been obtained, a neuraminidase inhibitor was designed by assuming that the hydrolysis reaction involved an oxocarbenium ion–like transition state with significant positive charge accumulation at the anomeric center. This would result in C-2 and C-3 adopting a planar configuration, and therefore compounds that mimicked this geometry were hoped to have inhibitory activity. Indeed, Neu5Ac-2-ene (DANA; Figure 55.6) has a micromolar Ki value. Interestingly, this compound inhibits most sialidases, but does not inhibit the trypanosome trans-sialidase and only weakly bacterial sialidases. Structure of neuraminidase inhibitors. Chemical structure of sialic acid (Neu5Ac, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetyl neuraminic acid), DANA; 4-amino-DANA; 4-guanidino-DANA (Relenza, zanamivir); (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxyl)-1-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic (more...) A visual inspection of the X-ray structure of influenza neuraminidase with DANA bound showed that two glutamate residues lined a pocket near carbon 4 of the sialic acid analog. The pocket is fairly open, suggesting that a bulkier substituent at this position might be tolerated. A substrate analog containing a positively charged guanidinium group instead of the hydroxyl at carbon 4 (4-guanidino-DANA; Figure 55.6) is a remarkably potent influenza neuraminidase inhibitor (Ki=10−11 m). The higher affinity is presumably due to a salt bridge formed between the charged guanidinium group and the carboxylates lining the pocket. The analog is nearly a million times less potent on human sialidases, leading to its approval and use as the anti-influenza drug Relenza (Chapter 57). It does not work on bacterial sialidases, however, because the equivalent pocket is filled with an arginine group and is only a modest (low-micromolar) inhibitor of the human neuraminidases.'
 'Diastereomers as well as alkylated and acylated analogs of the alkaloids have interesting and useful properties. Notably, the galactose-configured analog of deoxynojirimycin (Galafold; Figure 55.1) has been approved as a pharmacological chaperone of the lysosomal α-galactosidase for the treatment of the lysosomal storage disease known as Fabry disease (Chapter 44). Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme generally impair its ability to fold and traffic from the ER to lysosomes. Galafold can bind to the mutant α-galactosidase in the ER and help it fold and avoid degradation leading to its improved trafficking and activity within lysosomes. N-Butylation of deoxynojirimycin makes this glucosidase inhibitor an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis, which is discussed in more detail further below. In other cases, alkylation of the amino group or acylation of the hydroxyl groups can improve the potency of the compound, presumably by facilitating uptake across the plasma and Golgi membranes. Some of these compounds have shown positive effects for treating diabetes, cancer, HIV infection, and lysosomal storage diseases (see Chapter 57), but some also induce male sterility. A major challenge with all of these enzymes is their limited specificity; thus while convenient and widely used, some caution is needed when interpreting resulting observations. The importance of O-GlcNAc addition to many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) has stimulated interest in developing agents to inhibit its addition by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or its removal by O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]). These enzymes provide excellent examples of successful rational design and medicinal chemistry efforts directed to the development of glycoside hydrolase and glycosyltransferase inhibitors. Alloxan and streptozotocin affect O-GlcNAc addition, but these compounds lack specificity. The first potentially useful OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1; Figure 55.3) was obtained by screening chemical libraries for compounds that displaced a fluorescent derivative of the donor sugar, UDP-GlcNAc. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry led to quinoline-containing ester (OSMI-4), which is a high-quality OGT inhibitor that is effective in cells. The active compounds do not block other N-acetylglucosamine addition reactions—for example, one involved in formation of the polysaccharide backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan (Chapter 21). In addition, 5SGlcNAc is another inhibitor of OGT that acts as a metabolic precursor leading to formation of UDP-5SGlcNAc. Its peracetylated form (Ac-5SGlcNAc) crosses cell membranes and undergoes deacetylation by nonspecific esterases to generate cell-active inhibitors. Modification of the N-acetyl group to give S5GlcNHex eliminated the need to have O-acetylation and provided a compound that could be used in vivo, although, like other metabolic precursor inhibitors, their use requires care because of possible off-target effects on other enzymes (e.g., GlcNAc transferases [Chapter 9]). Inhibitors of O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (OGA) and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT).  Several O-GlcNAcase inhibitors are based on N-acetylglucosamine. The first described, PUGNAc (Figure 55.3) inhibits O-GlcNAcase at nanomolar concentrations, but also inhibits lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (HexA and HexB; Chapter 44). 1,2-Dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NButGT) and the more potent aminothiazoline Thiamet-G are more specific and potent in cells than PUGNAc (Figure 55.3). A rationally designed glucoimidazole, GlcNAcstatin, also potently inhibits O-GlcNAcase with good selectivity over HexA and HexB.'
 'Xylosides (Figure 55.1) have a mild effect on glycolipid formation, possibly because of the similarity between xylose and glucose and the assembly of a GM3-like compound (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Xylβ-O-R) on the primer. Because cells take up intermediates in glycolipid biosynthesis, they behave like synthetic glycoside primers. For example, glucosylceramide produces complex glycolipids when fed to cells. More direct competitive inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) have been generated with a view to their potential benefit in Gaucher disease (Chapter 44), which stems from accumulation of glucosylceramide caused by loss-of-function mutations in β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). D-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (D-PDMP; Figure 55.4) has been a widely used compound; however, it also inhibits the activity of purified lactosylceramide synthase. Medicinal chemistry efforts have led to the close analog eliglustat, which although it does not gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), is approved for treating type I Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder in which glucocerebrosidase is missing (Chapter 44). Its beneficial activity occurs through “substrate deprivation” by blocking synthesis of glycosphingolipids, thereby “depriving” the lysosome of substrate. Subsequent efforts have led to CNS permeable GCS inhibitors including venglustat, which is advancing through late stage clinical trials. The α-glucosidase inhibitor, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, known commercially as miglustat, also inhibits GCS and is approved for treating Niemann–Pick disease type C and Gaucher disease. Inhibitors of glycosphingolipid metabolism.  The search for active compounds often benefits from serendipity and the synthesis of disaccharide (or larger) acceptor analogs with appropriate modifications is labor intensive, as is the preparation of complicated nucleotide sugar analogs. Nevertheless, the approach has yielded insights into the binding and reactivity of the glycan-processing enzymes, and substrate analogs with selectivity for particular enzymes have been developed in this way. Improvements in recombinant expression systems have led to increasing numbers of X-ray crystal structures, which provides clues for deriving mechanism-based inhibitors in the future (Chapter 6). The utility of any glycosyltransferase inhibitor ultimately depends on its ability to cross the plasma membrane and enter the Golgi where the glycosyltransferases reside. Unfortunately, many of the compounds described above lack activity in cells, presumably because their polarity and charge prevents their uptake. More than 40 years ago, Okayama and colleagues found that D-xylose in β-linkage to a hydrophobic aglycone (the noncarbohydrate portion of a glycoside) was taken up efficiently and inhibited the assembly of glycosaminoglycans on proteoglycans. Xylosides mimic the natural substrate, xylosylated serine residues in proteoglycan core proteins, and thus act as a substrate. “Priming” of chains occurs on the added xyloside, which diverts the assembly process from the endogenous core proteins and causes inhibition of proteoglycan formation. In general, cells incubated with xylosides secrete large amounts of individual glycosaminoglycan chains and accumulate proteoglycans containing truncated chains. The success of β-D-xylosides in altering proteoglycan biosynthesis suggested that other glycosides might function similarly (Figure 55.5). Subsequent studies showed that β-N-acetylgalactosaminides prime oligosaccharides found on mucins and inhibit O-glycosylation of glycoproteins. Other active glycosides include β-glucosides, β-galactosides, β-N-acetylglucosaminides, and even disaccharides and trisaccharides. These latter compounds require conjugation to appropriate aglycones and acetylation to mask the polar carbohydrate hydroxyl groups.']","The rational approach to inhibitor design, guided by crystal structures for other sialidases, has great potential for developing species-specific analogs. This strategy not only benefits neuraminidase inhibitors but also extends to O-GlcNAcase and OGT inhibitors.

"Complete the following paragraph: Another type of N-glycosylation found in γ-proteobacteria involves a cytosolic N-glycosyltransferase (NGT) that targets the N-X-S/T acceptor sequence motif recognized by mammalian OST (Chapter 9). NGT transfers a single monosaccharide (e.g., Glc) from an activated sugar nucleotide donor, with loose donor substrate specificity that includes both UDP and GDP sugar nucleotides. This provides an entirely new approach to engineering alternate types of N-glycosylation.","[""Paralogs of these enzymes have not been described in the well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but biochemical data suggests that this yeast modifies intracellular proteins with mannose (Man) and even di- and tri-Man. Furthermore, several reports suggest that select intracellular proteins of mammalian cells are modified by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). The significance of these intriguing latter examples awaits identification of the responsible glycosyltransferases and evidence for their roles in cells. Examples in which the glycosyltransferases are known are represented schematically in Figure 18.1A and summarized in Table 18.1. Cellular topography of nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation. (A) Monoglycosylation (m) in the cytoplasm (e.g., O-GlcNAc and O-Fuc). (B) Complex (c) glycosylation in the cytoplasm by O-GlcNAc transferases (GTs) that extend the first sugar. (C) Cytoplasmic monoglycosylation (more...) Examples of nuclear or cytoplasmic glycosylation events  Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent. An example of bacterial monoglycosylation that leads to a known function comes from the EF-P protein, the bacterial homolog of eukaryotic elongation initiation factor 5a. In some bacteria, EF-P suppresses translational stalling by a mechanism that involves oxidation of a critical lysyl residue, and its eukaryotic ortholog is regulated by hypusylation. A recent phylogenetic analysis of EF-P sequences revealed a subset of enzymes with an Arg in place of Lys, and a coevolving gene that was subsequently identified by biochemistry and mass spectrometry as an argininyl rhamnosyltransferase. Assembly of the Rha-Arg linkage activates EF-P and is required for pathogenicity of Pseudomonas, a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen, and a number of other bacteria. The discovery of this linkage by a phylogenetic approach suggests that more noncanonical examples of glycosylation are yet to be discovered. A directed proteomics search for glycoproteins in the Gram-positive intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, biased only because potential glycopeptides were affinity enriched with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), identified several glycoproteins with cytoplasmic localization and functions: the molecular chaperone DnaK, the PdhC E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the DNA translocase FtsK1, the signal recognition particle receptor FtsY, FtsZ involved in cell division, and others of unknown function. Peptides from these proteins were modified with single HexNAc residues attached to Ser residues. Some of the sites were variably modified, hinting at a novel regulatory process, but nothing is known about the mechanism of this glycosylation. Pathogenic bacteria have developed a wide array of toxin and effector virulence factors that also monoglycosylate host-cell proteins (Figure 18.1C). By virtue of their glycosyltransferase domains, these impair the host's cytoplasmic or nuclear machinery and disrupt host-cell immune response. For example, small cytoplasmic G-proteins (GTP-binding proteins) of the Rho family are involved in regulating the cytoskeleton. Certain toxins from anaerobic bacteria were found to contain retaining glycosyltransferase activities that inhibit G-proteins by attaching a glycosyl moiety to a threonine residue (Thr-37) in their GTP-binding sites. These secreted toxins show the remarkable ability of translocating across the surface membrane into the cytoplasm of mammalian target cells. The enterotoxins from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) and Clostridium sordellii are α-glucosyltransferases from CAZy family GT44 that use UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) as the donor. In contrast, a similar toxin from Clostridium novyi is an O-αGlcNAc transferase that uses UDP-GlcNAc as the donor.""
 'Bacteria efficiently produce free and lipid-linked oligo- and polysaccharides including capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) (Chapter 21), and these pathways have been engineered to produce a variety of complex human-like glycans. In particular, the LPS pathway has been used to engineer and display glycans in E. coli. LPS consists of a base lipid (lipid A) linked to a core oligosaccharide followed by highly diverse O-polysaccharides (O-antigens). Genetically interrupting biosynthesis of the lipid A core oligosaccharide prevents coupling of the O-antigen, thereby allowing engineering of novel glycans on lipid A for display on the cell surface. This strategy has been used to engineer the synthesis of a variety of human glycan epitopes, including blood group antigens (Chapter 14) and cancer-associated glycolipid glycans (Chapter 11). In a complex example of engineering large free complex glycans in bacteria, 4-O-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (Chapter 17), was produced in E. coli by deleting a fructosyltransferase (kfoE), introducing bacterial UDP-Glc/-GlcNAc 4-epimerase and chondroitin synthase genes, and introducing a mutated human chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase gene, opening the way for glycosaminoglycan production in bacteria. Two types of native protein N-glycosylation occur in some bacteria, although not in E. coli. One type is similar to eukaryotic cell N-glycosylation with production of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide in the cytosol, which is then transferred en bloc to Asn by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) in the periplasm. The OST of C. jejuni, PglB, is a single polypeptide related to the catalytic STT3 subunits of the multiprotein OST complex of eukaryotes (Chapter 9). PglB shows a more restricted acceptor sequence motif than the eukaryotic N-X-S/T, with requirement of an acidic residue (D/EXNXS/T, in which X cannot be P) (Chapter 21). This places some restrictions on the usefulness of engineering human-like N-glycans, because most N-glycan sites in mammalian proteins do not conform to this extended consensus sequence. PglBs from other species, or mutants evolved by adaptive evolution, have been identified to address this problem, but further improvements are needed. Importantly, PglB has rather relaxed donor substrate specificity. Although bacterial lipid-linked oligosaccharides are distinct from those in eukaryotes, PglB can use mammalian-type lipid-linked oligosaccharides as donors. An important feature for using prokaryotes for glycoengineering is the arrangement of entire glycosylation machineries in multigene operons. This enables the transfer of large genetic elements of 10–20 kb between species. A major achievement was the successful transfer of the entire N-glycosylation operon from C. jejuni to E. coli, producing N-linked glycoproteins in E. coli. Production of glycoproteins carrying a Man3GlcNAc2 core N-glycan has been achieved by introduction of eukaryotic enzymes (Table 56.1). Bacterial N-linked glycosylation is being exploited as an alternative method for glycoconjugate vaccine production, and vaccines against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have been developed. Another type of N-glycosylation found in γ-proteobacteria involves a cytosolic N-glycosyltransferase (NGT) that targets the N-X-S/T acceptor sequence motif recognized by mammalian OST (Chapter 9). NGT transfers a single monosaccharide (e.g., Glc) from an activated sugar nucleotide donor, with loose donor substrate specificity that includes both UDP and GDP sugar nucleotides. This provides an entirely new approach to engineering alternate types of N-glycosylation.'
 'Another type of N-glycosylation found in γ-proteobacteria involves a cytosolic N-glycosyltransferase (NGT) that targets the N-X-S/T acceptor sequence motif recognized by mammalian OST (Chapter 9). NGT transfers a single monosaccharide (e.g., Glc) from an activated sugar nucleotide donor, with loose donor substrate specificity that includes both UDP and GDP sugar nucleotides. This provides an entirely new approach to engineering alternate types of N-glycosylation. Engineering this pathway in bacteria resulted in the assembly of glycan motifs including α1-3-galactose epitopes as well as fucosylated and sialylated lactose or poly-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units primed by Glc residues on glycoproteins (Table 56.1). Although most bacteria do not have the capacity for sialylation, there are exceptions (Chapters 15 and 21). Bacterial genes for CMP-sialic acid synthesis and for sialyltransferases with specificities similar to those in mammals have been introduced with plasmids or integrated into the genome of host bacteria cells, enabling the production of sialylated N- and O-glycoproteins. Some bacteria have processive O-glycosylation pathways controlled by glycosyltransferases using activated sugar donors. These pathways inspired the engineering of human O-glycosylation reactions in E. coli. By introducing mammalian polypeptide GalNAc-transferase genes and a UDP-Glc/GlcNAc 4-epimerase, O-GalNAc protein glycosylation (Chapter 10) has been achieved. Further introduction of a β1-3-galactosyltransferase enabled biosynthesis of core 1 O-glycans (T antigen) on cytoplasmic acceptor proteins. Introduction of GalNAc residues has been used for postexpression enzymatic addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatized sialic acids to enhance the therapeutic properties of protein drugs. Other bacteria possess a protein O-glycosylation mechanism that is unlike the stepwise biosynthesis of O-glycans in eukaryotes (Chapter 10), in that preassembled undecaprenol-PP-linked oligosaccharides are transferred en bloc to proteins by several OSTs with relaxed donor substrate specificities and poorly understood acceptor substrate specificities. Engineering of this endogenous glycosylation machinery has been used for en bloc transfer of human O-GalNAc glycans (Tn, T, sialyl-Tn, and sialyl-T antigens) onto acceptor proteins (Table 56.1). Yeast natively produce N-glycans and O-mannosyl glycans on diverse glycoproteins. The general features of the biosynthetic pathways for initial glycan transfer are common in eukaryotes from yeast to human, and the enzymes involved are highly homologous. However, subsequent glycan processing in yeast generally results in polymannosylated glycans instead of the complex N- and O-glycans found in “higher” eukaryotes (Figure 56.1). Yeast have similar systems for protein folding, quality control, and posttranslational modifications to other eukaryotic cells, in contrast to bacteria. Because genetic engineering in yeast has long been rapid and easy, experience with glycoengineering is more advanced in this organism compared with most others. Several commercial ventures have been based on engineering “humanized” N-glycosylation in yeast; the Pichia GlycoSwitch platform uses engineered yeast to add simple human N-glycans to expressed proteins. N-glycans on yeast glycoproteins differ from those in vertebrates (Chapter 9), comprising large polymannosyl glycans on a poly(Manα1-6)n backbone, which are highly immunogenic in mammals (Chapter 23). A key α1-6-mannosyltransferase, Och1p largely initiates polymannosylation.'
 'γ-Proteobacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, possess a nontraditional cytoplasmic pathway for N-glycosylation that does not involve assembly of oligosaccharides on a lipid-linked intermediate, but instead transfers single glycan moieties to proteins from nucleotide-activated precursors. The soluble GTs (NGTs) required for N-glycosylation in these organisms are also completely unrelated to the conventional STT3-orthologous OTases, yet prefer the eukaryotic sequon, N-X-S/T. H. influenzae N-glycosylates its autotransporter adhesion HMW1 with single glucose and galactose residues. In contrast, Shewanella oneidensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and N. meningitidis add rhamnose to Arg32 of their polyproline specific elongation factor to rescue stalled ribosomes. In addition to N-glycosylation, bacteria possess both canonical and noncanonical pathways for O-glycosylation. For the O-glycosylation system that mirrors the process in eukaryotes, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use nucleotide-activated sugars and soluble GTs in the cytoplasm to modify serine and threonine residues on specific proteins, particularly surface structures, such as flagella, pili, and adhesins. Pseudaminic acids, legionaminic acids, and related nonulosonic sugars are common monosaccharides attached by C. jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Aeromonas caviae to their flagella and these modifications are essential for filament assembly and bacterial motility. The noncanonical pathway for O-glycosylation in Gram-negative bacteria involves glycosyltransferase assembly of nucleotide-activated sugars onto undecaprenylphosphate, flipping of the completed oligosaccharide en bloc across the inner membrane into the periplasm, and addition of glycans onto S/T residues by a general OTase. This alternate pathway has been thoroughly characterized in Neisseria species, in which multiple proteins (including pilin) are glycosylated with an oligosaccharide containing diNAcBac (or variants such as glyceramidoacetamidotrideoxyhexose or diacetamidodideoxyglucopyranose) at the reducing end, the same carbohydrate attached to Asn residues by the C. jejuni N-glycosylation pathway. Gram-positive bacteria lack surface LPS, but many instead possess a regular array of glycoproteins known as S-layer proteins. The oligosaccharides on these S-layer proteins are also first assembled onto an undecaprenylphosphate carrier and subsequently added onto S/T residues of these proteins, but can also be coupled to hydroxyl groups of tyrosine residues. Bacteria encounter extreme differences in osmolarity in the environment (and must withstand up to 6 atmospheres of turgor pressure!) and have thus evolved both physical and chemical mechanisms to resist disruption. Peptidoglycan, as discussed earlier, provides a structural barrier to osmotic swelling. In many α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria, a chemical mechanism also exists to protect the inner membrane. In these Gram-negative organisms, osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs; previously known as membrane-derived oligosaccharides [MDOs]) contribute to an osmotic buffer. These compounds constitute up to 5% of the dry weight of E. coli, and their synthesis is induced by low osmotic conditions. These characteristics are similar to the production of fOS derived from the N-glycosylation pathways of Campylobacter species, which lack normal OPGs. OPGs were first discovered during analysis of Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture supernatants and rediscovered in studies of phospholipid turnover in E. coli, which showed that the polar head groups of phosphatidylglycerol were transferred to low-molecular-weight, water-soluble oligosaccharides (and thus named MDOs). Other organisms, including Pseudomonas, Rhizobia, Brucella, and Salmonella, also make these compounds.'
 'The Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol precursor translocates across the ER membrane bilayer via a “flippase” encoded by the RFT1 locus in yeast. Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol is extended by the addition of four Man and three Glc residues transferred from Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc, respectively. Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc donors are formed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane from GDP-Man and UDP-Glc. Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc must also be flipped across the ER membrane. Mammalian MPDU1 is an ER membrane protein necessary for the utilization of Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc in the ER lumen in the synthesis of the mature N-glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol (Figure 9.3). This 14-sugar glycan is transferred by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) to Asn in receptive Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons in protein regions that have translocated across the ER membrane. OST is a multisubunit protein complex in the ER membrane, except in the case of the kinetoplastids (Chapter 43). OST catalyzes the transfer of the oligosaccharide from Dol-P-P to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in newly synthesized regions of proteins during passage through the translocon into the ER. OST has a high specificity for the completely assembled oligosaccharide, which is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in most eukaryotes. When incomplete oligosaccharides are assembled, transfer efficiency is reduced, resulting in hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins that mature with empty N-glycan sites. All OST subunits are transmembrane proteins with between one and 13 transmembrane domains. The OST complex cleaves the high-energy GlcNAc-P bond, releasing Dol-P-P in the process (Figure 9.3). Yeast OST is comprised of eight different subunits Stt3p, Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost2p, Ost4p, Ost5p, and Ost3p or Ost6p. Stt3p is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The two OST complexes (containing either of the thioredoxin-subunit Ost3p or Ost6p) have a different protein–substrate specificity. The complexity of OST increases in multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are two different catalytic STT3 subunits that both associate with ribophorins I and II, OST48, OST4, and DAD1 proteins (homologs of the yeast Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, Ost4p, and Ost2p, respectively). The STT3A complex (OSTA), closely associated with the translocon, contains the KCP2 and DC2 subunits, whereas the STT3B complex (OSTB) that has either MAGT1 or TUSC3 (homologs of yeast Ost3p/Ost6p) glycosylates polypeptides posttranslationally after their translocation into the ER. On binding to the catalytic STT3 subunit, the client peptide adopts a 180° turn, making polypeptide folding a competing reaction for N-glycosylation. Indeed, the thioredoxin subunits of the OST complex (Ost3p/Ost6p; MAGT1/TUSC1) modulate the oxidative folding of the client polypeptide, thereby extending the polypeptide substrate range of OST. As of February 2021, the UniProt database reports 1911 N-glycosylation sites in yeast and 13,648 in murine glycoproteins. Following the covalent attachment of the 14-sugar glycan to Asn-X-Ser/Thr in a protein, processing reactions trim the N-glycan in the ER. The initial steps have key roles in regulating glycoprotein folding via interactions with ER chaperones that recognize specific features of the trimmed N-glycan (Chapter 39).']","This type of N-glycosylation in γ-proteobacteria involves a cytosolic N-glycosyltransferase (NGT) that recognizes the N-X-S/T acceptor sequence motif similar to mammalian OST. NGT transfers a single monosaccharide, such as Glc, from an activated sugar nucleotide donor, with a broad donor substrate specificity that encompasses both UDP and GDP sugar nucleotides. This innovative approach offers a new avenue for manipulating different forms of N-glycosylation.","Engineering this pathway in bacteria resulted in the assembly of glycan motifs including α1-3-galactose epitopes as well as fucosylated and sialylated lactose or poly-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units primed by Glc residues on glycoproteins (Table 56.1).

"Complete the following paragraph: The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease targets the lysosomes of macrophages via the cell-surface mannose receptor (see Chapter 31).

Further clinical studies are likely to reveal the potential and limitations of SRT. EET or pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT) is based on the concept that inhibitors of an enzyme can act as molecular chaperones to stabilize the mutated enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When the enzyme reaches the lysosome, the inhibitor dissociates at low pH and the abundant stored material is gradually digested. The overall increase in activity is small, but it can have significant clinical benefits. Clinical trials are in progress for treating Fabry disease, Gaucher type I, and Pompe disease, whereas preclinical trials are being performed for GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis. A potential problem is that some inhibitors may not cross the blood–brain barrier, limiting their effectiveness in the central nervous system (CNS). The advent of high-throughput screening methods and large chemical libraries increase the potential of this approach. In addition, allosteric site binders can be selected that remain bound to the enzyme, and any successful compound could be used in combination with ERT to further enhance activity. ERT has been quite successful for treating Gaucher's disease. Injection of glucocerebrosidase carrying mannose-terminated N-glycans targets the enzyme to the macrophage/monocytes, which are the primary sites of substrate accumulation. In use now for many years, the added enzyme consistently improves patients’ clinical features with minimal side effects. The cost of treatment is high, and high doses are no more effective than lower doses for improving visceral and hematological pathologies. The proven effectiveness makes glucocerebrosidase the favorite therapy for these patients, but terminal mannose residues cannot be used to target the enzyme to other cells or organs or to enable treatment of other lysosomal storage disorders. Insufficient infused enzyme crosses the blood–brain barrier thus, the enzyme (Cerezyme) works very well for type I disease without neurological involvement but not for the less common Gaucher's with neurological involvement. In addition, patients sometimes develop antibodies against the injected human protein. ERT trials with other recombinant lysosomal enzymes have progressed. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II, IVA, and VI and is under development for others. Combination therapy using ERT and a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize the therapeutic enzyme in the bloodstream is being considered. Recombinant α-galactosidase for Fabry disease works well and recombinant α-L-iduronidase for MPS I works very well with the intermediate severity form (Hurler–Scheie), but its effect is unclear for patients with the more common neurological form (Hurler syndrome). HSCT, presumably providing α-L-iduronidase in CNS from the donor-derived microglia, is effective to MPS I. Recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B; Naglazyme) was approved for MPS VI, as was α-glucosidase (Myozyme) for treating Pompe disease patients. Iduronic acid-2-sulfatase (Elaprase) is approved for treating Hunter syndrome. These results clearly validate this approach. The efficacy of most of these enzymes relies on the engineering of Man-6-P-containing glycans. This is one of the foremost examples of how the clinically motivated exploration of a disorder (I-cell disease) led to the discovery of Man-6-P-based targeting of lysosomal enzymes (Chapter 33) and the development of an entire industry targeting therapy for multiple diseases. The availability of animals deficient in specific lysosomal enzymes offers appropriate systems to test the efficacy of corrective genes, compounds, and enzymes. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Junko Matsuda and Nathan Lewis.""
 ""During the normal biosynthesis of lysosomal enzymes, their N-glycans become modified with mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues, which target them to lysosomes using Man-6-P receptors (see Chapter 30). The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease targets the lysosomes of macrophages via the cell-surface mannose receptor (see Chapter 31). The four recombinant enzyme products imiglucerase (approved in 1995), velaglucerase (approved in 2010), taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso, approved in 2012), and eliglustat (Cerdelga, approved in 2014) are marketed to treat Gaucher's disease. The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe's disease. The replacement therapies clearly have beneficial effects and prolong life but are extremely expensive. A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Low-molecular-weight competitive inhibitors of some of these enzymes can act as “chaperones,” which stabilize the folded enzyme in the ER and effectively rescue the mutation and increase the steady state concentration of active enzyme in the lysosome. The dose of the inhibitor must be carefully adjusted to ensure that the inhibitory effects on enzyme function do not overshadow beneficial effects on folding. Only a low level of enzyme restoration is needed to significantly reduce the accumulation of undigested glycan substrates, indicating that lysosomal hydrolases are normally present in large catalytic excess. The use of purified glycans as therapeutics has received less attention than the development of glycoprotein-based treatments. Difficulties in establishing structure–activity relationships because of the large number of stereocenters and functional groups, undesirable pharmacokinetics of available formulations, poor oral absorption of the compounds, and low-affinity interactions with drug targets have limited their development. Some successful glycan drugs, such as the anticoagulant heparin, are given by injection, although efforts are under way to convert heparin into an orally absorbable form by complexing it with positively charged molecules. It may be possible to deliver other hydrophilic and/or negatively charged glycan drugs in this way to allow penetration of the intestinal barrier. Glycans are also sometimes attached to hydrophobic drugs to improve the drugs’ solubility and ability to cross biological membranes to enter cells and alter their pharmacokinetics. The anticoagulant heparin is, as discussed in Chapters 16, 43, and 46, one of the most widely prescribed drugs today. Heparin binds and activates antithrombin, a protease inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. Antithrombin activation leads to rapid inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa, shutting down the production of fibrin clots. Billions of doses of heparin (several metric tons) are produced by autodigestion of pig intestines, followed by graded fractionation of the products. Unfractionated heparin produces a variable anticoagulant response as it also binds to several plasma, platelet, and endothelial proteins. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins are derived from chemical or enzymatic cleavage of heparin to form smaller fragments. The pharmacological properties and the relative efficacy of the various LMW heparins are superior to those of unfractionated heparin and fewer secondary complications are reported. LMW heparins have replaced unfractionated heparins as therapeutic of choice in virtually all developed countries. In price-sensitive markets the unfractionated products are still heavily used. The preparation of recombinant heparin based on heparin biosynthesis enzymes is still under development. Arixtra, a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide that binds antithrombin exactly as isolated heparin is used to prevent deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and has gained market share in recent years even though it is more costly.""
 ""The variable contributions of these pathways are important for therapy of some diseases. Patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib (CDG-Ib), who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase, benefit greatly from oral mannose supplementation to bypass the insufficient supply of glucose-derived mannose 6-phosphate. A few CDG-IIc patients defective in fucose transporters have been treated with fucose to restore synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x on leukocytes (see Chapter 42). Some patients with Crohn's disease show clinical improvement with oral N-acetylglucosamine supplementation, but the mechanism is unknown. Mice deficient in GNE activity have kidney failure, but providing N-acetylmannosamine in the diet prevents this outcome. Clinical trials using N-acetylmannosamine to treat GNE-deficient patients with hereditary inclusion body myopathy type II (HIBM-II) have been conducted but have yielded inconclusive results. Some monosaccharides and disaccharides can be toxic to humans who lack specific catabolizing enzymes. For example, people who lack fructoaldolase (aldolase B) accumulate fructose-1-phosphate, which ultimately causes ATP depletion and disrupts glycogen metabolism. Prolonged fructose exposure in these people can be fatal, and fructose-limited diets are critical. Deficiencies in the ability to metabolize galactose (see Chapter 4) are mostly due to a severe reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity and cause galactosemia. Although these patients are asymptomatic at birth, ingesting milk leads to vomiting and diarrhea, cataracts, hepatomegaly, and even neonatal death. Low-galactose or galactose-free diets can prevent these life-threatening symptoms. However, even these diets do not prevent unexplained long-term complications, which include speech and learning disabilities and ovarian failure in females with galactosemia. Infants hydrolyze lactose (Galβ1-4Glc) quite well, but the level of intestinal lactase catalyzing the breakdown of lactose can be much lower or absent in adults because of down-regulation of lactase gene expression after childhood. About two-thirds of the human population has lactase nonpersistence, making milk products a dietary annoyance. Unabsorbed lactose provides an osmotic load and is metabolized by colonic bacteria, causing diarrhea, abdominal bloating, flatulence, and nausea. Lactase persistence has evolved in certain pastoral populations from northwestern Europe, India, and Africa, allowing milk consumption in adult life. However, many adults either avoid lactose-containing foods or use lactase tablets to improve lactose digestion. The failure to turn over glycans by lysosomal degradation driven by a plethora of glycoside hydrolases causes serious problems for patients with lysosomal storage disorders. Deficiencies in individual lysosomal enzymes or their trafficking lead to pathological accumulation of their substrates in inclusion bodies inside the cells (see Chapter 41). One approach to treating these disorders is to inhibit initial glycan synthesis, a strategy termed substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Reduced synthesis of the initial compound decreases the load on the impaired enzyme, and some patients show significant clinical improvement. A small-molecule drug used for SRT is N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (or N-butyl-DNJ) (miglustat, Zavesca), which was approved in 2002 to treat Gaucher's disease (glucocerebrosidase deficiency). Another approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders is enzyme replacement therapy. Unlike most therapeutic glycoproteins that interact with target receptors on the surface of cells, lysosomal enzymes developed for replacement therapy must be delivered intracellularly to lysosomes, their site of action. During the normal biosynthesis of lysosomal enzymes, their N-glycans become modified with mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues, which target them to lysosomes using Man-6-P receptors (see Chapter 30). The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease targets the lysosomes of macrophages via the cell-surface mannose receptor (see Chapter 31).""
 ""Lysosomal degradation of glycans can be blocked by raising the intralysosomal pH, by inactivating a particular glycosidase, by mutation, or by protein-specific inhibitors. Lysosomal enzymes usually have acidic pH optima, and adding ammonium chloride or chloroquine slows degradation by increasing the intralysosomal pH. However, some lysosomal enzymes have relatively broad pH optima, higher than the lysosome. Some active “lysosomal” enzymes can be found in early and late endosomes, which have a higher pH than lysosomes. Glycosylation inhibitors are covered in Chapter 55 but some of these agents also inhibit specific lysosomal enzymes. For example, swainsonine blocks lysosomal α-mannosidase as well as the α-mannosidase II involved in glycoprotein processing. Sheep and cattle become neurologically deranged by eating food rich in swainsonine, which is also called locoweed. These temporary symptoms are likely induced because lysosomal α-mannosidase is inhibited. Undegraded oligosaccharides probably accumulate in affected animals. Although many inhibitors block various enzymes in vitro, they may not be effective in cells or whole animals because they may not enter the lysosome at sufficient concentrations. Study of lysosomal enzyme defects provided major insights into catabolic pathways and showed their importance to human health. Mannose 6-phosphate targeting of lysosomal enzymes was discovered by showing that cocultivation of fibroblasts from patients with different storage diseases led to the disappearance of stored material in both types of cells. Each supplied the corrective factors (i.e., lysosomal enzymes) that the other cell lacked by delivery of secreted enzymes through cell-surface mannose 6-phosphate receptors (Chapter 33). Cross-correction provides the mechanistic basis for an important mode of therapy and highlights the fact that only a relatively small amount of enzyme may be needed to prevent accumulation of storage products and the resulting pathology. Some estimates suggest that <5% of normal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity may be sufficient to prevent pathological symptoms of Tay–Sachs disease. In fact, the index Scheie patient with α-L-iduronidase deficiency had <1% normal activity in fibroblasts and lived 77 years. Current therapeutic approaches include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), enzyme enhancement therapy (EET), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Gene replacement therapy is a promising future approach because it would avoid the sustained delivery necessary for ERT. Accumulation of stored undegraded material occurs because the rate of glycan synthesis is greater than its degradation at steady state. SRT reduces the glycan's synthetic rate to counter low glycosidase activity. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease by using N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. When wild-type mice were treated with this compound, the amount of glycosphingolipids fell 50%–70% in all tissues without obvious pathological effects. When this compound was given to Sandhoff disease mice, the accumulation of GM2 in the brain was blocked and the amount of stored ganglioside reduced. Thus, reducing the synthesis of the primary precursor reduced the load of GM2 to levels that were degradable by the glycosidase-deficient mice. Because this compound inhibits the first biosynthetic step, theoretically this drug could reduce the accumulation of storage products in any glycolipid storage disorder. In clinical trials, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustat, Zavesca) was effective for many patients with mild-to-moderate Gaucher's disease, although improvement varied, as did side effects. Small trials in infantile Tay–Sachs disease patients did not arrest neurological deterioration but prevented macrocephaly. Further clinical studies are likely to reveal the potential and limitations of SRT. EET or pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT) is based on the concept that inhibitors of an enzyme can act as molecular chaperones to stabilize the mutated enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).""
 'Diastereomers as well as alkylated and acylated analogs of the alkaloids have interesting and useful properties. Notably, the galactose-configured analog of deoxynojirimycin (Galafold; Figure 55.1) has been approved as a pharmacological chaperone of the lysosomal α-galactosidase for the treatment of the lysosomal storage disease known as Fabry disease (Chapter 44). Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme generally impair its ability to fold and traffic from the ER to lysosomes. Galafold can bind to the mutant α-galactosidase in the ER and help it fold and avoid degradation leading to its improved trafficking and activity within lysosomes. N-Butylation of deoxynojirimycin makes this glucosidase inhibitor an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis, which is discussed in more detail further below. In other cases, alkylation of the amino group or acylation of the hydroxyl groups can improve the potency of the compound, presumably by facilitating uptake across the plasma and Golgi membranes. Some of these compounds have shown positive effects for treating diabetes, cancer, HIV infection, and lysosomal storage diseases (see Chapter 57), but some also induce male sterility. A major challenge with all of these enzymes is their limited specificity; thus while convenient and widely used, some caution is needed when interpreting resulting observations. The importance of O-GlcNAc addition to many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) has stimulated interest in developing agents to inhibit its addition by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or its removal by O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]). These enzymes provide excellent examples of successful rational design and medicinal chemistry efforts directed to the development of glycoside hydrolase and glycosyltransferase inhibitors. Alloxan and streptozotocin affect O-GlcNAc addition, but these compounds lack specificity. The first potentially useful OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1; Figure 55.3) was obtained by screening chemical libraries for compounds that displaced a fluorescent derivative of the donor sugar, UDP-GlcNAc. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry led to quinoline-containing ester (OSMI-4), which is a high-quality OGT inhibitor that is effective in cells. The active compounds do not block other N-acetylglucosamine addition reactions—for example, one involved in formation of the polysaccharide backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan (Chapter 21). In addition, 5SGlcNAc is another inhibitor of OGT that acts as a metabolic precursor leading to formation of UDP-5SGlcNAc. Its peracetylated form (Ac-5SGlcNAc) crosses cell membranes and undergoes deacetylation by nonspecific esterases to generate cell-active inhibitors. Modification of the N-acetyl group to give S5GlcNHex eliminated the need to have O-acetylation and provided a compound that could be used in vivo, although, like other metabolic precursor inhibitors, their use requires care because of possible off-target effects on other enzymes (e.g., GlcNAc transferases [Chapter 9]). Inhibitors of O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (OGA) and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT).  Several O-GlcNAcase inhibitors are based on N-acetylglucosamine. The first described, PUGNAc (Figure 55.3) inhibits O-GlcNAcase at nanomolar concentrations, but also inhibits lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (HexA and HexB; Chapter 44). 1,2-Dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NButGT) and the more potent aminothiazoline Thiamet-G are more specific and potent in cells than PUGNAc (Figure 55.3). A rationally designed glucoimidazole, GlcNAcstatin, also potently inhibits O-GlcNAcase with good selectivity over HexA and HexB.']","The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease targets the lysosomes of macrophages via the cell-surface mannose receptor (see Chapter 31). The four recombinant enzyme products imiglucerase (approved in 1995), velaglucerase (approved in 2010), taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso, approved in 2012), and eliglustat (Cerdelga, approved in 2014) are marketed to treat Gaucher's disease.","The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe's disease. The replacement therapies clearly have beneficial effects and prolong life but are extremely expensive. A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Low-molecular-weight competitive inhibitors of some of these enzymes can act as “chaperones,” which stabilize the folded enzyme in the ER and effectively rescue the mutation and increase the steady state concentration of active enzyme in the lysosome. The dose of the inhibitor must be carefully adjusted to ensure that the inhibitory effects on enzyme function do not overshadow beneficial effects on folding. Only a low level of enzyme restoration is needed to significantly reduce the accumulation of undigested glycan substrates, indicating that lysosomal hydrolases are normally present in large catalytic excess.",0.5,0.6301545862654006,0.713083677895783,0.015267175572519083,0.99999999998,1.0
"Complete the following paragraph: The elucidation of molecular mechanisms requires tools that mimic the presentation of glycans on the cell surface. Individual protein–carbohydrate interactions are often of low affinity and broad specificity, complicating the description of glycan function. Nature enhances specificity by utilizing multivalent interactions.","['Some functions of glycans are discovered serendipitously. In other instances, the investigator who has elucidated complete details of the structure and biosynthesis of a specific glycan is left without knowing its functions. It is necessary to design experiments that can differentiate between trivial and crucial functions mediated by each glycan. Various approaches are discussed below, emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach (also presented in schematic form in Figure 7.2). Approaches for elucidating the biological functions of glycans. The figure assumes that a specific biological role is being mediated by recognition of a certain glycan structure by a specific glycan-binding protein. Clues to this biological role could (more...) Many current approaches to understanding glycan diversity (Chapters 50 and 51) involve extraction and identification of the entire complement of glycans found in a given organ or tissue, without regard to the fact that individual cell types and even basal versus apical sides of the same cell can have widely varying glycan expression patterns. However, cell type–specific localization of glycans can be explored using highly specific GRPs (GBPs or antibodies, see Chapter 48). Once a specific glycan has been localized in an interesting biological context, it is natural to consider introducing the cognate GRP into the intact system, hoping to interfere with a specific function and generate an interpretable phenotype. Such an approach is likely to give confusing results with regard to glycan function. Some GRPs (e.g., antibodies against glycans) tend to have weak affinity and show cross-reactivity. Although some plant lectins seem very specific for animal glycans, they often originate from organisms that typically do not contain the same ligand. Thus, their apparent specificity may not be as reliable when introducing them into complex animal biological systems in which they might bind unknown, cross-reacting glycans. Finally, most GRPs are multivalent, and their cognate ligands (the glycans) tend to be present in multiple copies on multiple glycoconjugates. Thus, introduction of a GRP into a complex biological system may cause nonspecific aggregation of various molecules and cell types, and the effects seen may extend well beyond the biological functions of the glycan in question. It would seem worthwhile to develop recombinant monovalent GRP modules that are derived from the same system being investigated, provided they are of high enough affinity. Effects of introducing such monovalent GRPs as competitors of the native function may yield more interpretable clues. Many pharmacological agents can metabolically inhibit or alter glycosylation in intact cells and animals (Chapter 49). Although such agents are powerful tools to elucidate biosynthetic pathways, they can yield confusing results in complex systems. One concern is that an inhibitor may have effects on other unrelated pathways. For example, the bacterial inhibitor tunicamycin that blocks N-linked glycosylation can also cause ER stress and inhibit UDP-Gal uptake into the Golgi. The second concern is that the inhibitor may cause such global changes in glycan synthesis that the physical properties of the glycoconjugates and/or membranes are altered, making it difficult to interpret the results. Somewhat more useful results can be obtained by introducing low-molecular-weight primers of terminal glycosylation (Chapter 55), which can act as alternate substrates for Golgi enzymes, diverting synthesis away from the endogenous glycoproteins. However, this approach can simultaneously generate incomplete glycans on endogenous glycoconjugates, as well as produce secreted glycan chains, each with their own biological effects. Because specific “carbohydrate-recognition domains” can be identified within a primary amino acid sequence (Chapters 28 and 29), it is now possible to predict whether a newly cloned protein can bind glycans. If a potential GBP can be produced in sufficient quantities, techniques such as hemagglutination, flow cytometry, surface plasmon resonance, and affinity chromatography (Chapters 29 and 28) can then be used to search for specific ligands. However, the monovalent affinity of the putative GBP for its ligand may not be high. Thus, high densities and/or multivalent arrays may be needed to avoid missing a biologically relevant interaction. The question also arises as to where exactly to look for the biologically relevant ligands in a complex multicellular system.'

The biological effects that glycans elicit are frequently dependent on recognition of specific glycan features by the proteins with which they interact. In this chapter, some of the key structural features underlying glycan–protein interactions, as well as the primary experimental methods that have led to an understanding of these features, are discussed, specifically X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cryo-electron microscopy, and computational modeling. As emphasized in previous chapters, the numbers of distinct glycans produced by various organisms are enormous, but at the same time, glycans lack the diversity in functional groups displayed by other molecules. To achieve specificity in glycan recognition, proteins rely as much on the stereospecific placement of glycan hydroxyl groups at chiral centers, use of different linkage sites, and extensive branching as they rely on specific modifications of hydroxyl groups by processes such as sulfation, phosphorylation, and esterification. This puts placement of various residues and functional groups in three dimensions at a premium. Building a three-dimensional picture of how recognition of glycans by proteins occurs is therefore essential if we are to understand how glycans are synthesized and recognized in the many physiological and pathological processes they control. It is also essential if we are to use knowledge of glycan recognition as a basis for the production of therapeutic agents that can control these processes in the event of disease. Building a structure depicting glycan recognition is not without its challenges. Most glycans are highly dynamic in solution, sampling many conformations. Often, a single or a small subset of conformations is selected when a complex forms. This works against the formation of stable complexes for structural studies and the direct use of solution conformational data in defining conformations of bound glycans. The search for a structural basis of glycan recognition by proteins is not new. The concept of glycans fitting into pockets on protein surfaces dates back to Emil Fischer, who used the phrase “lock and key” to refer to enzymes that recognize specific glycan substrates. Lysozyme was the first “carbohydrate-binding protein” to be crystallized and have its three-dimensional structure determined. Subsequent work in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a structure complexed with a tetrasaccharide that confirmed the existence of specific interactions occurring between sugars and proteins, and the ability of proteins to select the appropriate “key” from numerous possibilities. Today, protein crystallography has reached a very high degree of sophistication and is responsible for the vast majority of the more than 170,000 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB); however, producing a structure with ligands in place is still challenging. The structures that exist tend to have ligands that are relatively small and interact with particularly high binding constants. Glycan recognition frequently involves contacts with multiple residues to achieve specificity. So, native glycan ligands are often larger than other types of ligands. Often, high avidity is achieved through multivalent interactions, in which case the affinity for an isolated ligand–protein interaction is small. Nevertheless, there are a significant number of crystal structures for glycan–protein complexes, and these have contributed greatly to our understanding of the types of interactions that make glycan recognition possible. Structural information on bound glycan ligands that is complementary to that from X-ray crystallography is increasingly coming from NMR methods. This is particularly valuable in that it is applicable to ligands with a broader range of affinities, including many that have the lower affinities amplified in multivalent interactions. It is also applicable in solution under near-physiological conditions in which concerns about the effects of crystal lattice contacts and occlusion of some interaction sites are absent. It is even possible to conduct some experiments on assemblies that mimic a membrane surface environment, an environment in which many protein–glycan interactions occur.'
 'The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions. The binding proteins in turn fall into two broad groups: lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins (Chapters 27, 28, and 38). Such molecules can be either intrinsic to the organism that synthesized the cognate glycans (e.g., see Chapters 31–36, 38, and 39) or extrinsic (see Chapters 37 and 42 for information concerning microbial proteins that bind to specific glycans on host cells). The atomic details of these glycan–protein interactions have been elucidated in many instances (Chapters 29 and 30). Although there are exceptions to this notion, the following general theme has emerged regarding lectins: monovalent binding tends to be of relatively low affinity, and such systems typically achieve their specificity and function by achieving high avidity, via interactions of multivalent arrays of glycans with cognate lectin-binding sites. Whenever a new tool (e.g., an antibody or lectin) specific for detecting a particular glycan is developed and used to probe its expression in intact organisms, it is common to find exquisitely specific temporal and spatial patterns of expression of that glycan in relation to cellular activation, embryonic development, organogenesis, and differentiation (see Chapter 41 for examples). Certain relatively specific changes in expression of glycans are also often found in the course of transformation and progression to malignancy (Chapter 47), as well as other pathological situations such as inflammation (Chapter 46). These spatially and temporally controlled patterns of glycan expression imply the involvement of glycans in many normal and pathological processes, the precise mechanisms of which are understood in only some cases. Remarkably little is still known about the evolution of glycosylation. There are clearly shared and unique features of glycosylation in different kingdoms and taxa. Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target. The specialized glycans expressed by parasites and microbes that are of great interest from the biomedical point of view (Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 43) may themselves be subject to evolutionary selection pressures. These issues are further considered in Chapter 20, which also discusses the limited information concerning how various glycan biosynthetic pathways appear to have evolved and diverged in different life-forms. Numerous natural bioactive molecules are glycoconjugates, and the attached glycans can have dramatic effects on the biosynthesis, stability, action, and turnover of these molecules in intact organisms. For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology. Patenting a glycoprotein drug, obtaining FDA approval for its use, and monitoring its production all require knowledge of the structure of its glycans.'
 'The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells. In the embryonic state, or in other states of neural “plasticity,” polySia chains tend to be long, thereby interfering with homophilic binding (Chapter 15). There are also instances wherein functions can be tuned by glycans attached to other neighboring structures. For example, polySias of embryonic NCAM can interfere with interactions of other unrelated receptor–ligand pairs, simply by physically separating the cells. Also, tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the insulin receptors can be modulated by endogenous cell-surface gangliosides, possibly by organizing them into membrane microdomains (Chapter 11). Although the precise mechanisms of the latter effects are uncertain, specificity is implied by the requirement for a defined glycan sequence on the ganglioside. Because most of such “tuning” effects of glycans are partial, their overall importance tends to be questioned. However, the sum total of several such partial effects can result in a dramatic effects on the final biological outcome. Thus, glycosylation appears to be a mechanism for generating important functional diversity from the limited set of basic receptor–ligand interactions that are possible, when using gene products from a typical genome. Of course, as with most other glycan functions, exceptions can be found. There are many receptors whose ligand binding is independent of glycosylation and many peptide ligands whose binding and action are not obviously affected by glycosylation. Many glycans are specifically recognized and engaged by various viruses, phages, bacteria, and parasites and also targeted by many toxins (Chapter 37). Given rapid evolution of pathogens and ongoing selection, there is typically excellent recognition specificity for the sequence of the glycans involved. For example, the hemagglutinins of many viruses specifically recognize the type of host sialic acid, its modifications, and its glycosidic linkage to the underlying sugar chain. Likewise, various toxins bind with great specificity to certain gangliosides but not to the same glycan epitopes presented on proteins (Chapters 11 and 37). There is little doubt about the importance of structural specificity with respect to these functions of glycans. Indeed, some of the microbial binding proteins involved have been harnessed as molecular probes for studying the expression of their cognate glycans. However, providing such signposts to aid the success of pathogenic microorganisms has little obvious value to the organism that synthesized such glycans. To counter such deleterious consequences, some organisms have also evolved the ability to mask or modify glycans recognized by microorganisms or toxins. Meanwhile, glycan sequences on soluble glycoconjugates, such as secreted mucins, act as decoys for microorganisms and parasites. Thus, a pathogenic organism or toxin evolving to bind to mucosal cell membranes may first encounter its cognate ligand attached to a soluble mucin, which can then be washed away, removing the danger to cells underneath. In contrast, instances occur in which symbiosis is mediated by specific glycan recognition, such as some commensal bacteria in the gut lumen of animals and the bacteria involved in forming plant root nodules in nitrogen fixing legumes or mycorrhizal symbioses between trees and fungi (Chapter 40). Many pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) often consist of foreign glycans and/or glycan patterns that, on invading microbes, are recognized by innate immune cells and are detected by specific receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectins (Chapter 34). Last but not least, innate immune mechanisms are kept in check in vivo via recognition of self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs). Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43).'
 'We can distinguish three types of glycan fragment ions depending on the type and amount of information they carry (Figure 51.3). Collision-induced dissociation–tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) of released N-glycans. (A) MS of released N-glycans: Masses are shown as doubly charged ions with corresponding monosaccharide compositions. (B) CID-MS/MS of m/z of [1098.25] (more...) Ideally, a fragmentation spectrum containing all possible glycosidic fragments would allow the assignment of the primary sequence and branching of a glycan structure. In practice, however, most CID approaches provide glycosidic fragments, but several methods or a combination of methods (LC retention times, exoglycosidase digestions, ion mode, derivatization, multiple fragmentation steps, i.e., MSn) are usually used to fully define a particular structure of interest. Biosynthetic rules can be and often are applied to aid the glycan characterization. A further challenge is that many key glycan modifications such as O-acetylation, pyruvylation, etc., are labile to, and/or missed with, current analytical methods. This problem can result in populating databases with misleading or biased information. As just one example, although many databases assume that a sialic acid at the terminus of the vertebrate glycan chain is N-acetylneuraminic acid, there are in fact dozens of kinds of modified sialic acids in nature, and the differences can have profound effects on biological functions (Chapter 15). The same is true of N- and O-sulfate esters on HexNAc and hexosamine residues (Chapters 14 and 17). These analytical challenges are still being pursued. Meanwhile, in many instances, it would make sense to not make definitive positional assignments of modifications on the glycan chains. Releasing the glycans from the protein(s) is currently a prerequisite for glycomics. The described techniques above are, however, complementary to support the assignment of glycan structures still attached to peptides, the techniques for which are less well-developed and present greater challenges (see below). N-linked and O-linked glycomics are still the only techniques that can detail the overall glycan structural landscape of the surface of a cell (if applied in combination with plasma membrane enrichment) so they will continue to be valid approaches in the foreseeable future to define cell–cell interactions and to discover disease biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. However, there may not be a need for de novo analysis of every single glycan in the future. Matching of fragment spectra using fragmentation libraries containing many of the more ubiquitously expressed glycans (Chapter 52) is becoming a pathway to quickly assign a majority of structures fully or partially and allows researchers to focus on validation of only the structures that are important for addressing the biological question. Similar to proteomics, automated glycan identification should ideally be performed with stringent confidence thresholds by, for example, determining the false discovery rate of the reported identifications. Novel fragmentation techniques, the introduction of ion mobility MS, and in vivo or in vitro incorporation of heavy isotopic monosaccharides or tags are starting to provide other opportunities for the isomeric glycan structural characterization, quantitation, and visualization that are currently lacking in glycomic mass spectrometric techniques. A key question that often follows the identification of important glycosylation features by glycomics is, which proteins carry the implicated glycan structures and at which sites? Given that protein glycosylation is dependent on the concerted action of multiple glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases, one might expect all glycoproteins that traffic through the secretory pathway to be equally susceptible to similar modifications. However, protein- and site-specific glycosylation are well-recognized features of protein glycosylation. Although the underlying molecular basis for protein- and site-specific glycosylation is not entirely understood, contributing factors are likely to include common sequence motifs, protein structural conformation, unique physicochemical patches surrounding the glycosylation site, or some yet-unknown traits that collectively allow individual proteins to be sought out from among hundreds or thousands of other proteins to be acted on by the glycosylation machinery in a specific way.']","The elucidation of molecular mechanisms requires tools that mimic the presentation of glycans on the cell surface. Individual protein–carbohydrate interactions are often of low affinity and broad specificity, complicating the description of glycan function. Nature enhances specificity by utilizing multivalent interactions.","The number and the presentation of carbohydrate residues on a biomolecule are major determinants of binding avidity of ligands to cell-surface receptors. The transition from monovalent to multivalent is often associated with a larger variation in affinity/avidity, suggesting a “thresholding” effect, and in some cases cooperativity. To elucidate those mechanisms, glycans have to be displayed in a scenario closer to that found on the cellular scale. “Nanotechnology” moves from the angstrom to the nanometer range (from ∼10−10 to ∼10−7 m), offering the tools to create, manipulate, and characterize structures on those scales. Large glycoconjugates bearing multiple copies of a carbohydrate on various scaffolds, such as glycodendrimers or glycopolymers, have been generated to probe carbohydrate–protein interactions.",1.0,0.7143394391403934,0.7718307030814786,0.007194244604316547,0.99999999998,0.4
Complete the following paragraph: Synthetic or naturally derived oligosaccharides can also be covalently appended to polymer chains built from petroleum-based monomers. This gives rise to glycopolymers with architectures resembling those of glycoproteins or proteoglycans.,"[""In this complex, one part of the heparin chain interacts with antithrombin, and another part of the heparin chain interacts with thrombin. Between the antithrombin-binding domain and thrombin-binding domain, a linker of six to seven saccharide residues exists. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, the biosynthesis of GAGs is not regulated by a well-defined template. Instead, each member of the GAG family is synthesized by a unique pathway (Chapter 17). The HS synthesis pathway, for example, involves multiple enzymes, including specific glycosyltransferases (or HS polymerase), an epimerase, and several sulfotransferases. Moreover, HS is biosynthesized as a polymer covalently linked to a proteoglycan that consists of a core protein and polysaccharide side chains; the functions of these proteoglycans are, in fact, dominated by the properties of the HS chains added. Although this is a non-template-driven process, the overall structures of HS generally remain unchanged between generations. There is considerable interest in understanding the mechanism that controls the structure of HS. The biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate is less understood than that of HS. Chondroitin sulfate tends to be synthesized on different proteoglycan core proteins and requires a different set of polymerases and sulfotransferases than the enzymes specifically recognizing HS polysaccharides. To synthesize the IdoA residues in dermatan sulfate, a specialized epimerase is required. Hyaluronic acid biosynthesis is quite different: it is not synthesized on a core protein, it does not take place in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and it only requires one hyaluronic acid synthase (a dual activity glycosyltransferase), as the polysaccharide does not contain sulfate groups or IdoA residues (Chapter 16). The interactions of bacteria with their environment provide an excellent example of how polysaccharide properties play an important role in an organism's survival. Bacterial polysaccharides are especially diverse, in that they can include a larger number of distinct sugar residues in their RUs (usually two to six residues), and they can include branching. Many of them are parts of bacterial cell membranes where they serve important structural and protective roles. Because of their location on the outside of the cell, bacterial polysaccharides such as lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), capsular polysaccharides (CPSs), and exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are often potent antigens that elicit a strong immune response in humans. LPSs carry long polysaccharides called O-antigens and are unique to Gram-negative bacteria where they constitute the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. These types of bacteria may also carry CPSs forming a relatively dense additional layer around the bacterial cell. Cell wall lipoteichoic acids and teichoic acids are unique components of Gram-positive bacteria, which are often surrounded by a CPS or a less dense EPS layer. The variation in biosynthetic pathways among bacterial species is ultimately responsible for the diversity in bacterial polysaccharides. The biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides is discussed further in Chapter 21. Here the authors present a few examples to illustrate how synthesis of backbone structures, branching, and postpolymerization modification lead to a diverse set of polymer structures. In one of the biosynthetic pathways, sugar residues are added sequentially onto an anchor molecule; thus, the polymer is growing from the terminal, nonreducing end until a termination entity/substituent is added that precludes further chain elongation—for example, in the O-antigen polysaccharide of the LPS from Escherichia coli O8 (Figure 3.4A). The polymer is linear, and although sugar residues are added step-by-step to form the polysaccharide, RUs can be identified.""
 'These local preferences influence association properties and ultimately structural characteristics. When extended to a long cellulose polymer, cellobiose units generate elongated strands that can pack and interact with other strands through hydrogen bonds to form layers. Layers in turn interact through a combination of forces to form fibrils composed of 18 polymer chains. The more helical strands in starch cannot pack easily and result in a more amorphous material. Repeating units from cellulose and starch showing conformation and glycosidic torsion angles φ and ψ.  Other important polysaccharides, such as pectins found in plant cell walls, help plants accommodate changes during growth. Pectins are some of the most complex polymers in nature. They are based on polymers of α(1-4)-linked galacturonic acid (GalA) or the RU, -2)-α-L-Rha-(1-4)-α-D-GalA-(1-, and may contain additional sugar and nonsugar substituents, including methyl and acetyl esters. The negatively charged carboxyl group at the 6-position of the GalA residues contributes to the water solubility of these polymers and the long-range interactions that give them gelling properties useful in the food industry. Oligo- and polysaccharides of plant origin are discussed in detail in Chapter 24. Animals also use polysaccharides for various purposes. Glycogen is a storage polymer related to starch in that it is a glucose polymer with primarily α(1-4)-linkages connecting glucose residues, but it is highly branched having additional α(1-6)-linkages to some of the glucose residues. Structural polymers also exist; for example, the repeating polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, -[4GlcNAcβ1-]n, is the primary component of chitin, the material that forms the exoskeletons of arachnids, crustaceans, and insects (Chapter 26). Modifications of glucose residues by replacing the hydroxyl group at 2-position with an amine group and subsequent N-acetylation change the structural properties significantly. These changes allow for the formation of composites with proteins and minerals that lead to additional variation in structure and function. Most cell-surface polysaccharides found in animals belong to a class of glycans known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Chapter 17). Abundantly present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix, GAGs are linear macromolecules with molecular mass of >15,000 Da. The building blocks of most GAGs are composed of an amino-substituted sugar and a hexuronic acid residue. Modifications on the sugar residues—in particular, the sulfation of hydroxyl or the amino groups—are common. The sulfates and hexuronic acid carboxylate groups are negatively charged under physiological conditions. Thus, GAGs are the most anionic molecules present in the animal kingdom. Commonly found GAGs include chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate (HS), hyaluronic acid, and keratan sulfate. These GAGs structurally differ in their disaccharide RUs. For example, chondroitin sulfates consist of disaccharide RUs of [4GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-]n, whereas HS consists of disaccharide RUs of [4GlcAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-]n or [4IdoAα1-4GlcNSα1-]n (Figure 3.3A). Structural diversity of these polymers is primarily a result of additional sulfation of hydroxyl groups and is discussed below for the diverse HS polymers found in mammals. GAGs found in other animals can be distinct from mammalian GAGs by virtue of further modifications. For example, marine invertebrates can carry particularly unique sulfation patterns (i.e., 3-O-sulfation on GlcA residues) and distinct side-chain modifications (i.e., fucosylation on chondroitin sulfate).'
 'In one of the biosynthetic pathways, sugar residues are added sequentially onto an anchor molecule; thus, the polymer is growing from the terminal, nonreducing end until a termination entity/substituent is added that precludes further chain elongation—for example, in the O-antigen polysaccharide of the LPS from Escherichia coli O8 (Figure 3.4A). The polymer is linear, and although sugar residues are added step-by-step to form the polysaccharide, RUs can be identified. Schematic representation in SNFG (Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans) format of repeating units of bacterial polysaccharides: (A) O-antigen of E. coli O8, (B) O-polysaccharide of Salmonella enterica O54, (C) O-antigen of E. coli O168, (D) O-polysaccharide (more...) Some heteropolysaccharides contain two alternating sequentially added sugar residues and a formal RU can be identified. Often a processive glycosyltransferase is responsible for forming this pattern as is the case in the synthesis of the O-polysaccharide of Salmonella enterica O54 (Figure 3.4B). When two sugar residues alternate, branched structures can be formed, as one sugar may give rise to the polymer backbone and one a side chain. Polysaccharides are not always built from the nonreducing end, and preformed subunits can be used in the assembly. For example, synthesis of the E. coli antigens O5ab and O5ac relies on a preformed linear oligosaccharide, with five sugar residues constituting the RU. The oligosaccharide is built on an undecaprenyl pyrophosphoryl glycoside anchor molecule. This oligosaccharide is then added onto another oligosaccharide–lipid anchor to grow the polymer from the “reducing end.” When polymerization is taking place at the penultimate sugar of the oligosaccharide a branched RU results (cf. O-antigen of E. coli O168 [Figure 3.4C]). Branching can be introduced by the addition of sugars following polymer backbone formation. Helicobacter pylori O-antigens often contain human blood group structures as part of their RUs. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-galactose are added in a processive manner onto an undecaprenyl pyrophosphoryl carrier, thereby forming a linear polysaccharide composed of Galβ1-4GlcNAc (LacNAc) disaccharide RUs. Subsequently, L-fucosyl residues are added onto the backbone polysaccharide resulting in branched Lewis-type structures (Figure 3.4D). Bacterial saccharides consist of diverse monosaccharides (Chapter 2) including 6-deoxy-hexoses like L-rhamnose or L-fucose as well as rare sugars that are often found at the terminal position of the oligosaccharide–lipid acceptors. On polymerization, the rare monosaccharides become part of the side chain in branched structures and give rise to structural epitopes that are characteristic for bacterial species. In some cases, these epitopes are the basis for molecular mimicry (Chapter 42). Furthermore, these sugar residues constitute the terminal entity of the polysaccharide chain, which can be recognized by antibodies of the immune system. The polysaccharide may also be decorated by substituents such as amino acids, O-acyl, or phosphodiester groups. It is not uncommon to find O-acetyl groups at the branch-point sugar residue, thereby leading to a highly crowded substitution pattern in which all positions on the sugar residue are either part of a glycosidic linkage or carry a nonsugar substituent. Examples of diversity by substituent addition are the O-antigens of Shigella flexneri in which glucosyl, O-acetyl, or phosphoethanolamine groups are added to the backbone (Figure 3.4E). Branching and substituent addition affect the properties of polysaccharide solutions, such as gelling and high viscosity.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.3 Carlito B. Lebrilla, Jian Liu, Göran Widmalm, and James H. Prestegard. This chapter discusses the diversity in structure and properties that results when multiple monosaccharides (Chapter 2) are linked together to form oligosaccharides and polysaccharides (the latter comprising much of the biomass on the planet). Some examples of the more complex polymeric assemblies that occur in nature are presented, and how these remarkable structures are generated is discussed. Except in their roles as sources of energy for living organisms, sugars seldom occur in nature as monosaccharides. Instead, they serve as building blocks for more complex molecules. In the most common process, an initial sugar is linked to an aglycone (often a lipid or a protein) and this sugar is further elaborated by covalently joining other sugars through glycosidic linkages (Chapter 2) between the anomeric carbon of the sugar being added and a hydroxyl oxygen of an existing sugar. The resulting glycans are called oligosaccharides (usually less than a dozen monosaccharides) or polysaccharides (usually more than a dozen monosaccharides). The latter are usually built on a core of repeating subunits of linked monosaccharides. The way in which assembly of both oligosaccharides and polysaccharides occurs produces structures of enormous diversity and widely varying properties. This allows glycans to fill roles that vary from cell-surface interactions with proteins important in differentiation, recognition, and proliferation of cells, to interactions with other glycans that generate the mechanical properties of plant and microbial cell walls. Diverse structures can be created by simply linking different monosaccharides through glycosidic bonds, to make oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. The diversity arises not only from the choice of sugars but also from the way they are linked. If there were just one way to link monosaccharides, the choice among the dozen or so commonly used sugars would make the resulting polysaccharides more diverse than polynucleotides (four nucleotide choices for DNA and RNA) but less diverse than polypeptides (20 amino acid choices for mammalian proteins). However, the possibility of making glycosidic bonds between the anomeric carbon of one sugar and any one of the unmodified hydroxyl groups in another mono- or oligosaccharide adds to the diversity, by allowing not only more linear products, but also branched products in which more than one hydroxyl group on a given sugar is used to make glycosidic bonds. In addition, each anomeric carbon is a stereogenic center, and therefore each glycosidic linkage can be constructed having either the α- or β-configuration. Building an oligosaccharide, such as a tetrasaccharide (four sugars) with an unlinked reducing end, using only a single sugar in one ring form, such as glucopyranose, the authors could construct 1792 distinct structures. Of course, not all theoretically possible molecules are produced in nature because of the lack of enzymes to build them, but many are made contributing to the wide range of functional properties that allow carbohydrates to play many important roles. Branching is a prime characteristic of many glycans found on mammalian cell surfaces. Glycans representing two major types of eukaryotic protein glycosylation are shown in Figure 3.1. An N-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the side-chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue that is a part of a consensus peptide sequence NX(S/T). An O-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the terminal oxygen of a serine or threonine residue.'
 'Like the hemiacetal, the acetal or glycosidic linkage can exist in two stereoisomeric forms: α and β. But unlike the hemiacetal, the acetal is configurationally stable under most conditions. Thus, once a glycosidic bond is formed, its configuration is maintained. Like acetals in general, glycosidic bonds can be hydrolyzed in dilute acid, generating the constituent monosaccharides from oligosaccharides. Glycoside formation. Conversion of a hemiacetal into an acetal.  Glycosidic bond construction is the central challenge of glycan synthesis and immense efforts have been devoted to high-yielding and stereoselective glycosylation reactions. An overview of glycan synthesis strategies is provided in Chapters 53 and 54. The hydroxyl groups present in both monosaccharides and oligosaccharides can be chemically modified without affecting the glycosidic linkages. Methylation is used in the structural analysis of glycans (see Chapter 50). Natural products containing partially methylated glycans are known and a number of methyltransferases have been identified. A variety of different enzymes can esterify the hydroxyl groups of glycans to transiently vary glycan structure. Esterification is sometimes required for interactions with other biomolecules. The most important types of sugar esters in nature are phosphate esters (including diphosphate esters), acyl esters (with acetic acid or fatty acids), and sulfate esters. Acyl esters can sometime migrate to other hydroxyl groups on the same monosaccharide. The replacement of monosaccharide hydroxyl groups with hydrogen atoms forms deoxysugars. Nature has evolved enzymes to perform this reaction in a minimum number of steps, whereas chemically multistep procedures are required. Deoxygenation of ribose within a ribonucleotide to form the 2-deoxyribonucleotide is a critical reaction in DNA biosynthesis. Fucose (Fuc), one of the common vertebrate monosaccharides, is deoxygenated at C-6 during its biosynthesis from mannose (Chapter 5). Many monosaccharides contain N-acetamido groups, such as GlcNAc, GalNAc, and NeuNAc. Free amino groups, formed by de-N-acetylation of the N-acetamido group, are rare and found in heparan sulfate (HS) (Chapter 17), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (Chapter 12), neuraminic acid (Chapter 15), and in many bacterial glycan structures (Chapter 20). Amino groups can be modified with sulfates, similar to hydroxyl groups, as found in HS. A variety of linkages can be formed between two monosaccharides. The glycosidic linkage can give rise to two possible stereoisomers at the anomeric carbon of one sugar (α or β). Also, the many hydroxyl groups of the other sugar permit several possible regioisomers. Two glucose residues, for example, can be joined together in numerous ways, as illustrated by maltose (Glcα4Glc) and gentiobiose (Glcβ6Glc) (Figure 2.14). These isomers have very different three-dimensional structures and biological activities. A monosaccharide can engage in more than two glycosidic linkages, thus serving as a branchpoint. The common occurrence of branched sequences (as opposed to the linear sequences that are found in almost all peptides and oligonucleotides) is unique to glycans and contributes to their structural diversity. Two isomeric disaccharides.  The relationship of the glycosidic bond to oligosaccharides is analogous to the relationship of the amide bond to polypeptides and the phosphodiester bond to polynucleotides. However, amino acids and nucleotides are linked in only one fashion during the formation of polypeptides and nucleic acids, respectively; there is no stereochemical or regiochemical diversity in these biopolymers.']","This gives rise to glycopolymers with architectures resembling those of glycoproteins or proteoglycans. Glycopolymers can exhibit diverse structures and properties, contributing to their functionality in various applications.","Such materials have found increasing use as research tools to study the biological functions of glycans and are currently explored as biomaterials for drug delivery or as antifouling and antifreeze agents. Nanomaterials from plants and crustacean shells offer new materials for the development of biorenewable and biocompatible products. These nano-sized particles, consisting of bundled polymer chains, have properties and function that are different from the isolated polymer chains from which they are made. Such nanomaterials can be produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, chitin and chitosan. A more focused description is given below on nanomaterials from cellulose. Polysaccharides that have little or no branching of their backbone can self-assemble to form ordered structures in which the individual polymer chains stack along the chain axis, thus forming a crystalline structure. Cellulose is one example of a plant polysaccharide that has this type of crystalline structure. During cellulose biosynthesis individual glucan chains assemble to form microfibril structures that contain both crystalline and disordered arrangements (see Figure 59.1A). The high mechanical stiffness and tensile strength along the length of the cellulose microfibrils provide high mechanical strength, high strength-to-weight ratio, and toughness to plant tissues and organs.",0.0,0.7182280319850758,0.5893938549716726,0.015037593984962405,0.499999999975,0.0

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.1 Ajit Varki and Stuart Kornfeld. This chapter provides a historical background to the field of glycobiology and an overview of this book. General terms found in the volume are considered, common monosaccharide units of glycoconjugates mentioned, and a uniform symbol nomenclature used for structural depictions presented. The major glycan classes discussed in the book are described, and an overview of the general pathways for their biosynthesis is provided. Topological issues relevant to biosynthesis and functions of glycoconjugates are also considered, and the growing role of these molecules in medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioenergy, and materials science is mentioned. Defined in the broadest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (also called carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature and of the proteins that recognize them. How does glycobiology fit into the modern concepts of molecular biology? The central paradigm driving research in molecular biology has been that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The power of this concept lies in its template-based precision, the ability to manipulate one class of molecules based on knowledge of another, and the patterns of sequence homology and relatedness that predict function and reveal evolutionary relationships. With ongoing sequencing of numerous genomes, spectacular gains in understanding the biology of nucleic acids and proteins have occurred. Thus, many scientists assume that studying just these molecules will explain the makeup of cells, tissues, organs, physiological systems, and intact organisms. In fact, making a cell requires many small molecule metabolites as well as two other major classes of macromolecules—lipids and carbohydrates—which serve as intermediates in generating energy and as signaling effectors, recognition markers, and structural components. Taken together with the fact that they encompass some of the major posttranslational modifications of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates help explain how the relatively small number of genes in the typical genome can generate the enormous biological complexities inherent in the development, growth, and functioning of diverse organisms. The biological roles of carbohydrates are particularly prominent in the assembly of complex multicellular organs and organisms, which requires interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix. However, without any known exception, all cells and numerous macromolecules in nature carry an array of covalently attached sugars (monosaccharides) or sugar chains (oligosaccharides), which are generically referred to in this book as “glycans.” Sometimes glycans can also be freestanding entities. Being on the outer surface of cellular and secreted macromolecules, many glycans are in a position to modulate or mediate a variety of events in cell–cell, cell–matrix, and cell–molecule interactions critical to the development and function of a complex multicellular organism. They can also mediate interactions between organisms (e.g., between host and a parasite, pathogen, or a symbiont). In addition, simple, rapidly turning over, protein-bound glycans are abundant within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in which they can serve as regulatory switches. A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids). In analogy to the current situation in Cosmology, glycans can be considered as the “dark matter” of the biological universe: a major and critical component that has yet to be fully incorporated into the “standard model” of biology. However, unlike the situation with dark matter in the Universe, there is already a lot known about glycans. The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities.'
 'For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology. Patenting a glycoprotein drug, obtaining FDA approval for its use, and monitoring its production all require knowledge of the structure of its glycans. Moreover, glycoproteins, which include monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, and hormones, are by now the major products of the biotechnology industry, with sales in the tens of billions of dollars annually, which continues to grow at an increasing rate. In addition, several human disease states involve changes in glycan biosynthesis that can be of diagnostic and/or therapeutic significance. The emerging importance of glycobiology in medicine and biotechnology is discussed in Chapters 56 and 57. Although not traditionally considered part of “Glycobiology,” many natural and synthetic glycans are key components of Nanotechnology, Bioenergy, and Material Science. Glyconanomaterials (Chapter 58) have tunable chemical and physical properties and can be built on different scaffolds to probe cellular, tissue, and organismal interactions. Attached glycans can change nanomaterial properties, optimizing solubility and biocompatibility and lowering cytotoxicity. Glyconanomaterials have been used as imaging agents, spectroscopic tools, monitors of cellular systems, and vehicles for vaccination and drug delivery. Plant glycans are used for many purposes: energy sources, building materials, clothes, paper products, animal feed, and food and beverage additives (Chapter 59). Concerns about detrimental environmental effects and diminishing reserves of petroleum and its by-products have greatly renewed interest in using plant glycans for energy production, generation of polymers with improved or new functionalities, and as sources of high-value chemosynthetic precursors (Chapter 59). The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from the late Nathan Sharon, as well as helpful comments and suggestions from other editors.'
 'The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions. The binding proteins in turn fall into two broad groups: lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins (Chapters 27, 28, and 38). Such molecules can be either intrinsic to the organism that synthesized the cognate glycans (e.g., see Chapters 31–36, 38, and 39) or extrinsic (see Chapters 37 and 42 for information concerning microbial proteins that bind to specific glycans on host cells). The atomic details of these glycan–protein interactions have been elucidated in many instances (Chapters 29 and 30). Although there are exceptions to this notion, the following general theme has emerged regarding lectins: monovalent binding tends to be of relatively low affinity, and such systems typically achieve their specificity and function by achieving high avidity, via interactions of multivalent arrays of glycans with cognate lectin-binding sites. Whenever a new tool (e.g., an antibody or lectin) specific for detecting a particular glycan is developed and used to probe its expression in intact organisms, it is common to find exquisitely specific temporal and spatial patterns of expression of that glycan in relation to cellular activation, embryonic development, organogenesis, and differentiation (see Chapter 41 for examples). Certain relatively specific changes in expression of glycans are also often found in the course of transformation and progression to malignancy (Chapter 47), as well as other pathological situations such as inflammation (Chapter 46). These spatially and temporally controlled patterns of glycan expression imply the involvement of glycans in many normal and pathological processes, the precise mechanisms of which are understood in only some cases. Remarkably little is still known about the evolution of glycosylation. There are clearly shared and unique features of glycosylation in different kingdoms and taxa. Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target. The specialized glycans expressed by parasites and microbes that are of great interest from the biomedical point of view (Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 43) may themselves be subject to evolutionary selection pressures. These issues are further considered in Chapter 20, which also discusses the limited information concerning how various glycan biosynthetic pathways appear to have evolved and diverged in different life-forms. Numerous natural bioactive molecules are glycoconjugates, and the attached glycans can have dramatic effects on the biosynthesis, stability, action, and turnover of these molecules in intact organisms. For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology. Patenting a glycoprotein drug, obtaining FDA approval for its use, and monitoring its production all require knowledge of the structure of its glycans.'

Technological advances predicted to occur in the coming years are mentioned. Finally, a sampling of glycoscience-related questions that remain to be addressed in the future is presented. Every living cell in nature generates a complex and diverse array of glycans that is critical for the evolution, development, functioning, and survival of all natural biological systems (Chapter 1). A strong basic knowledge base regarding the genomics, chemistry, biochemistry, biosynthesis, and biological roles of these ubiquitous and diverse molecules is now well-established (Chapters 2–19).

Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41).'

Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities. Furthermore, during the molecular biology revolution of the 1970s, studies of glycans lagged far behind those of other major classes of molecules. This was in part because of their inherent structural complexity, the difficulty in determining their sequences, and the fact that their biosynthesis could not be directly predicted from a DNA template. The development of many new technologies for exploring the structures and functions of glycans has since opened a new frontier of molecular biology called “glycobiology”—a word first coined in the late 1980s to recognize the coming together of the traditional disciplines of carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry with a modern understanding of the cell and molecular biology of glycans and, in particular, their conjugates with proteins and lipids. Glycobiology is now one of the more rapidly growing fields in the natural sciences, with broad relevance to many areas of basic research, biomedicine, and biotechnology. The field includes the chemistry of carbohydrates, the enzymology of glycan formation and degradation, the recognition of glycans by specific proteins, roles of glycans in complex biological systems, and their analysis or manipulation by various techniques. Research in glycobiology thus requires a foundation not only in the nomenclature, biosynthesis, structure, chemical synthesis, and functions of glycans, but also in the general disciplines of molecular genetics, protein chemistry, cell biology, developmental biology, physiology, and medicine. This book provides an overview of the field, with relative emphasis on the glycans of animal systems. It is assumed that the reader has a basic background in advanced undergraduate-level chemistry, biochemistry, and cell biology. Some of the major investigators who influenced the early development of Glycobiology are shown in Figure 1.1, and more are listed in Online Appendix 1A.

General principles of glycobiology  Carbohydrates are defined as polyhydroxyaldehydes, polyhydroxyketones and their simple derivatives, or larger compounds that can be hydrolyzed into such units. A monosaccharide is a carbohydrate that usually cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler form. It has a potential carbonyl group at the end of the carbon chain (an aldehyde group) or at an inner carbon (a ketone group). These two types of monosaccharides are therefore named aldoses and ketoses, respectively (for examples, see below, and for more details, see Chapter 2). Free monosaccharides can exist in open-chain or ring forms (Figure 1.2). Ring forms of the monosaccharides are the general rule in oligosaccharides, which are linear or branched chains of monosaccharides attached to one another via glycosidic linkages (the term “polysaccharide” is typically used for large glycans composed of repeating oligosaccharide motifs; for examples, see Chapter 3). The ring form of a monosaccharide generates a chiral anomeric center at C-1 for aldo sugars or at C-2 for keto sugars (for details, see Chapter 2). A glycosidic linkage involves the attachment of a monosaccharide to another residue, typically via the hydroxyl group of this anomeric center, generating α-linkages or β-linkages that are defined based on the relationship of the glycosidic oxygen to the anomeric carbon and ring (Chapter 2).']","The closing chapter discusses the future potential of glycosciences for impacting basic and applied research, human health, material science, and renewable energy.

Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies.",1.0,0.26245508399410417,0.6860207430217874,0.008620689655172414,0.99999999998,1.0
How were CD33 Siglecs identified?,"[""Overall, it appears that this class of SIGLEC genes is subject to multiple “Red Queen” effects in evolution, in which evolutionary changes of sialyltransferases in response to the emergence of Sia-binding pathogens may lead to subsequent evolutionary changes of Siglec specificities (Figure 35.4).

To limit further complexity, two additional Red (more...) Below, we provide a brief summary of the main features of the human CD33rSiglecs and, where relevant, their murine counterparts. CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia. It has two Ig domains and was the first of the CD33rSiglecs to be characterized as an inhibitory receptor, suppressing activation of FcγRI and recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Figure 35.5). CD33 has some preference for α2-6- rather than α2-3-sialylated glycans and binds strongly to sialylated ligands on myeloid leukemia cell lines. The restricted expression of CD33 has been exploited in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia using gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody coupled to the toxic antibiotic calicheamicin. Binding of anti-CD33 mAbs to CD33 triggers endocytosis of the bound antibody. This depends on ITIM phosphorylation, recruitment of the E3 ligase Cbl, and ubiquitylation of the CD33 cytoplasmic tail. Selective expression of CD33 on leukemic progenitor cells also makes it an attractive target for therapy using chimeric antigen receptors expressed on cytotoxic T cells. Proposed biological functions mediated by CD33-related Siglecs. A generic CD33-related Siglec is represented, showing the location of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the potential for inhibitory signaling.  Recently, two coinherited single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with protection of humans against late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These SNPs result in increased exon 2 skipping, leading to raised levels of CD33 lacking the V-set domain and reduced levels of full-length CD33. Because full-length CD33 can inhibit microglial cell uptake of Aβ protein in a Sia-dependent manner, it is thought that individuals lacking the protective SNPs may accumulate more toxic Aβ proteins, thus driving Alzheimer's disease pathology. Targeting CD33 using antibodies that either inhibit function or promote internalization and degradation may be a useful approach to Alzheimer's disease. A complexity arises because the truncated form of CD33 appears to be retained intracellularly in peroxisomes, and the biological consequence of this diversion is currently uncertain. The murine ortholog of CD33 exists as two spliced forms that differ in the cytoplasmic region, neither containing the typical ITIM found in most other CD33rSiglecs. Furthermore, mouse CD33 has a lysine residue in the transmembrane sequence and couples to the DAP12 transmembrane adaptor, as shown for mouse Siglec-H and human Siglecs-14, -15, and -16. In contrast to human CD33, mouse CD33 in the blood is expressed mainly on neutrophils rather than monocytes, and at low levels in microglia, which also suggests a nonconserved function of this receptor. The SIGLEC5 and SIGLEC14 genes are adjacent to each other on chromosome 19 and encode proteins containing four and three Ig-like domains, respectively. Because of ongoing gene conversions within most taxa, the first two Ig domains of Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 share >99% sequence identity but then diverge, with Siglec-5 being an inhibitory receptor with typical ITIMs, whereas Siglec-14 can complex with DAP12 and activate signaling.""
 'Siglec-15 was first described as a highly conserved ancient Siglec in vertebrates. It lacks the typical arrangement of cysteines seen in the V-set Ig domain of other Siglecs and has an unusual intron–exon arrangement. Nevertheless, it can bind the Sialyl-Tn structure (Neu5Acα2-6GalNAcα) and other structures containing a Neu5Acα2-6HexNAc determinant. It associates with DAP12 but also has an ITIM-like motif in its cytoplasmic tail. Although first reported on macrophages and DCs in human lymphoid tissues, Siglec-15 is most strongly expressed in osteoclasts and their precursors in which it plays an important role, together with receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (RANK), in triggering osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclasts are key cells involved in bone degradation and share a common hemopoietic progenitor with macrophages. Mice lacking Siglec-15 show a mild osteopetrosis and impaired osteoclast differentiation. Specific antibodies against Siglec-15 phenocopy this state, because of antibody-induced internalization and degradation of Siglec-15. In addition, Siglec-15 is expressed in some tumor tissues (tumor-associated macrophages and cancer cells), and an antibody against Siglec-15 was shown to suppress the growth of a mouse melanoma in vivo. Siglec-15 therefore provides a novel target for diseases, such as menopause-related osteoporosis and cancer. Genes encoding most of the CD33rSiglec subfamily are clustered on human chromosome 19q13.3-13.4 or the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7. They include CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglecs-5 through -12, Siglec-14, and Siglec-16 in humans and CD33 and Siglecs-E, -F, -G, and -H in mice. Similar clusters are found in other mammals. It is difficult to assign all definitive orthologs between primates and rodents, resulting in different nomenclatures. One reason is that most IgSF domains are encoded by exons with phase-1 splice junctions, allowing exon shuffling without disrupting open reading frames, resulting in hybrid genes that are difficult to distinguish from similarly organized genes in other species. A second reason is that the Sia-binding V-set domains of the CD33rSiglecs are rapidly evolving, presumably to adjust their binding specificity to the rapid evolution of the endogenous host sialome, as well as evasion of binding by pathogens via molecular mimicry (Chapter 15) or specific protein-mediated interactions (see below). There are also multiple gene conversion events between adjacent genes and pseudogenes within this cluster. Of interest is the finding that humans show many CD33rSiglec differences compared with our closest evolutionary cousins (the chimpanzees), more than the differences between mice and rats, which shared a common ancestor much earlier (see below). As mentioned earlier, an “essential” arginine residue in all known Siglecs is required for binding Sia-containing ligands. This residue is often mutated in nature, resulting in loss of binding ability. Examples include Siglec-12 in humans, Siglecs-5 and -14 in the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, Siglec-6 in the baboon, and Siglec-H in the rat. The common arginine codon (CGN, where N is any nucleotide) tends to be highly mutable because of the CpG sequence (which is prone to TpG or CpA transition via cytosine methylation–deamination). However, the frequency with which such events occur suggests that it might be a natural mechanism to eliminate Sia binding of a given Siglec, when such activity becomes inappropriate under changing evolutionary pressures, without causing a complete loss of the Siglec. Overall, it appears that this class of SIGLEC genes is subject to multiple “Red Queen” effects in evolution, in which evolutionary changes of sialyltransferases in response to the emergence of Sia-binding pathogens may lead to subsequent evolutionary changes of Siglec specificities (Figure 35.4). Probable evolutionary chain of Red Queen effects involving Sias and CD33rSiglecs. See text for discussion.'
 'CD22 has seven Ig-like domains and the intracellular region has six tyrosine-based signaling motifs, three of which could function as ITIMs. CD22 is a well-established negative regulator of B-cell activation, making an important contribution toward the threshold for signaling via the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex. Following BCR cross-linking, CD22 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated on its ITIMs by the protein tyrosine kinase Lyn. This leads to recruitment and activation of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase and subsequent inhibition of downstream signaling mediated via the BCR. Although some activating molecules are also recruited to the phosphorylated tyrosine motifs in CD22, the net phenotype of CD22-deficient mice is consistent with a primary role of CD22 in negative regulatory signaling, manifested by enhanced BCR-induced calcium signaling, enhanced B-cell turnover, reduced numbers of recirculating B cells in the bone marrow, and reduced numbers of marginal zone B cells. Of all the Siglecs, CD22 has the most conserved specificity for sialylated ligands, binding primarily to α2-6-linked Sias of the type Neu5Ac(or Neu5Gc)α2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc, which are common capping structures of many complex-type N-glycans. Additional specificity can be conferred by the nature of the Sia moiety as well as sulfation of the underlying glycan. Neither human nor mouse CD22 binds 9-O-acetylated Sias; mouse CD22 has a strong preference for Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac, whereas human CD22 binds both of the latter forms. Recombinant soluble CD22 can precipitate a subset of glycoproteins from B-cell lysates including CD45, a major sialoprotein of T and B cells. However, on B cells, CD22 appears to mainly be either cis-associated with other CD22 molecules in a glycan-dependent manner, or with the BCR, which it inhibits in a glycan-independent manner. These interactions are consistent with studies of mouse mutants that either lack CD22 glycan ligands or express mutated forms of CD22 unable to bind glycans. B cells from ST6Gal-I-deficient mice that lack CD22 ligands show an anergic phenotype, essentially the opposite of the phenotype observed in CD22-deficient mice. Mice expressing a lectin-inactive version of CD22 with a mutated binding site arginine also show reduced BCR signaling (anergy) and, similar to ST6Gal-I-deficient mice, they show increased CD22-BCR association and stronger CD22 phosphorylation (Figure 35.3). Likewise, Cmah-null mice deficient in Neu5Gc have reduced ligands for mouse CD22 and Siglec-G (see below) and show B cell hyperactivity. Proposed biological functions mediated by CD22. CD22 glycan-dependent homotypic interactions in equilibrium with CD22–BCR interactions. CD22 is clustered together by Sia-dependent homotypic interaction and kept away from BCR on wild-type B cells, (more...) Besides regulating B-cell functions via cis-interactions, CD22 can also mediate trans-interactions with sialylated ligands on other cells that sequester CD22 away from the BCR. This could be important for raising B-cell activation thresholds to “self”-antigens and may help to ensure that signaling through the BCR can only occur in lymphoid tissues in which CD22 α2-6-sialylated ligands are abundant. Although CD22-deficiency alone does not lead to extensive autoimmune reactions, mice deficient in both CD22 and the other major B-cell Siglec, Siglec-G, develop SLE-like symptoms, including production of IgG autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis. The restricted expression and properties of CD22 make it an attractive therapeutic target. Antibody-based CD22-targeting agents, such as antibody–drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin and recombinant antibody–toxin fusion protein moxetumomab pasudotox, have been approved for clinical use (for acute B-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, respectively).'
 'Structural basis of Siglec binding to ligands. X-ray crystal structures of the V-set domains of sialoadhesin (Sn) (A) and Siglec-7 (B) are shown complexed with sialic acid. (C,D) Molecular details of the interactions of sialic acid with Sn and Siglec-7. (more...) The cell-surface glycocalyx of most vertebrate cells is richly decorated in glycoconjugates that contain Sias (Chapter 15). The high local concentration of Sias is likely to greatly exceed the Kd value of each Siglec, resulting in self-binding to sialoglycans on the same membrane (cis) that can be directly functional or that can “mask” the Sia-binding site from interacting with sialoglycans on other cells (trans). Consequently, the Sia-dependent binding activity of most naturally expressed Siglecs is strongly enhanced following treatment of cells with sialidase to eliminate the cis-interacting sialylated glycans. A notable exception is Sn, which was discovered via its native property as a Sia-dependent cell-adhesion molecule on macrophages. The “masked” state of most Siglecs is a dynamic equilibrium with multiple cis ligands. Thus, an external probe, a cell surface or a pathogen bearing high-affinity ligands or very high densities of Sia residues, can effectively compete for binding to “masked” Siglecs. In addition, changes in expression of glycosyltransferases or sialidases of endogenous or exogenous origin could influence masking and unmasking of Siglecs at the cell surface, especially during immune and inflammatory responses. Siglecs show restricted patterns of expression in single or related cell types (see below). This is most striking for the conserved Siglecs—Sn (macrophage), CD22 (B lymphocyte), MAG (myelin-forming cell), and Siglec-15 (osteoclast). This theme extends to some of the CD33rSiglecs, most notably in humans, including Siglec-6 on placental trophoblasts, Siglec-7 on NK (natural killer) cells, and Siglec-11 and -16 on tissue macrophages, including brain microglia in humans. In the mouse, Siglec-H and CD33 are excellent markers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) and blood neutrophils, respectively, and Siglec-F is a useful marker of eosinophils and alveolar macrophages. These cell type–restricted expression patterns are thought to reflect discrete, cell-specific functions mediated by each of these Siglecs. However, certain key cells of the human immune system, such as monocytes and conventional DCs, express multiple CD33rSiglecs. Most Siglecs have one or more tyrosine-based signaling motifs in their cytoplasmic tails or associate with membrane adaptor proteins containing cytosolic tyrosine motifs. The most prevalent motif is the ITIM with the consensus sequence (V/I/L)XYXX(L/V), where X is any amino acid. Up to 300 ITIM-containing membrane proteins are identified in the human genome, and many of these are established inhibitory receptors of the hematopoietic and immune systems. Following tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, they function by recruiting and activating SH2-domain-containing effectors, especially the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. These counteract activating signals triggered by receptors containing ITAMs. Some Siglecs, notably Siglecs-14, -15, -16, and -H and mouse CD33, have a positively charged residue within the transmembrane region, which can associate with the DAP12 ITAM-containing adaptor, thereby mediating activating functions. Sn (CD169) was identified as a Sia-dependent sheep erythrocyte receptor expressed by mouse stromal macrophages. Sn has an unusually large number of Ig domains (seventeen), which are conserved among mammals and reptiles. These may be important for extending the Sia-binding site away from the plasma membrane to promote intercellular interactions.'

I-type lectins are defined as glycan-binding proteins (excluding antibodies and T-cell receptors) in which the binding domain is homologous to the large and varied immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) of proteins. Among I-type lectins, the Siglec family of sialic acid–recognizing lectins is the best characterized subgroup, both structurally and functionally, and is therefore the major focus of this chapter. Details of their discovery, characterization, binding properties, and biology are provided, along with discussions of their functional roles in vertebrate biology, with most currently available information being in mammals, and multiple unusual changes during human evolution. The Ig fold is made up of antiparallel β-strands organized into a β-sandwich containing 100–120 amino acids and usually stabilized by an intersheet disulfide bond. Three types or “sets” of Ig domains are defined based on homologies in sequence and structure to domains of antibodies: the V-set variable-like domain, the C1- and C2-set constant-like domains, and the I-set domain that combines features of both V- and C-set domains. Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans. The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins. However, it became clear that these four Sia-binding molecules were a distinct subgroup sharing both sequence homology and Ig-domain organization, and that they were not all involved in adhesion. The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs. Siglecs are divided into two major subgroups based on sequence similarity (Figure 35.1) and on conservation among mammalian species. The first group comprises Sn (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), MAG (Siglec-4), and Siglec-15, for which there are clear-cut orthologs in all mammalian species examined and which share only ∼25%–30% sequence identity among each other.']","CD33 Siglecs were identified through genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed for the in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.","Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans.

What degree of polymerization is necessary for oligosaccharins to trigger plant defense?,"[""It is also noteworthy that some immune-active oligosaccharides can be released from polymers present in the walls of both the pathogen and the plant. For example, β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides are released from callose, which is produced by plants and is also a component of many fungal and oomycete cell walls. Similarly, β-1,4-glucan oligosaccharides are released from cellulose that is present in the cell walls of plants and some oomycetes. Oligosaccharins that are active in plants. Examples of oligosaccharides derived from fungal, oomycete, and plant cell walls are shown. The degree of polymerization (DP) of the minimally active oligosaccharide structures triggering some responses in plants (more...) The composition (monosaccharide units), degree of polymerization (DP), and branching of the oligosaccharins determine their biological activity in triggering plant defense. For example, oligogalacturonides that are biologically active typically require a DP of 10–14 for activity, whereas DPs of >7 and >4 are necessary for the oligochitosans and oligochitins, respectively (Figure 40.2). A single active hepta-glucoside from oomycete walls was isolated from a mixture of approximately 300 inactive structural isomers and found to trigger defense responses in soybean. Both the DP and location of the β-1-3 branches in this oligosaccharide are important for its biological activity (Figure 40.2). Elongating the oligosaccharide at the reducing end had no discernible effect on bioactivity and activity was also largely retained by removal of a single glucose from the reducing end. However, the hexa-glucoside was the minimal structure of this oligosaccharide that had appreciable activity in inducing defense responses in soybean. The low quantities and different types of glycan signal molecules that elicit defense responses suggest that these glycans are recognized by specific plasma membrane-localized receptors. A 75-kDa plasma membrane protein with high-binding affinity for chitin elicitors was identified in rice cell plasma membranes and proposed to be involved in oligosaccharide perception and signal transduction. This rice chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP) contains a lysozyme motif (LysM) on its ECD and no appreciable portion of the protein on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Similarly, a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase (CERK1) with a LysM-ECD is required for chitin-induced signaling in Arabidopsis. In both rice and Arabidopsis, the perception of chito-oligosaccharins involves an additional LysM-containing receptor, CERK1 and LYK5, respectively (Figure 40.2). A similar situation has been shown to exist in legumes (Medicago), which requires LYK9 (a AtCERK1 homolog) and LYR4 (a AtLYK5 homolog) for chito-oligosaccharide (DP=8) activation of defense signaling. Members of the LysM family of Arabidopsis are also involved, probably as coreceptors, in the perception of β-1,3-glucan and β-1,4/β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides. Recognition of pectin-derived oligogalacturonides in Arabidopsis involves wall-associated receptor-like kinases (WAKs; WAK1) that have an ECD with similarities to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of mammals. Reducing or impairing expression of genes encoding these receptors in plants by RNA interference (RNAi) or mutation results in suppression of defense responses. The interaction between Rhizobium and the roots of legumes is an agriculturally and economically important symbiotic relationship because it enables the plant to fix atmospheric nitrogen. An early step in this process is the plant's recognition of lipooligosaccharide signals (Nod factors), which are produced by the bacteria (Figure 40.3). Nod factors have a chitin oligosaccharide backbone containing from three to five GlcNAc residues.""
 ""Among the molecules perceived by PRRs are glycans (oligosaccharides) released from microbial and plant cell wall polysaccharides by hydrolytic enzymes originating from the plant or the pathogen. On binding of a ligand by its specific PRR, a PRR coreceptor is often recruited to form a protein complex, which leads to the activation of the receptor's cytoplasmic kinase domain and the initiation of defense responses. Defense response signaling can involve changes in ion flux across the plasma membrane (including a cytoplasmic Ca++ burst), the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidases (RBOHs), the phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated and calcium-dependent protein kinases (MPKs and CDPKs, respectively) and the up-regulation of defense-associated genes (Figure 40.1). These defense responses can lead to changes in the plant cell wall, the production of glycanases that fragment the pathogen's cell wall, and the synthesis of metabolites (phytoalexins) and antimicrobial proteins/peptides that inhibit pathogen growth. These defense responses often lead to localized cell death in the plant tissue, which is visible as necrotic spots at the site of infection and limits the pathogen's spread. Of the vast number of ligands that ECD-PRRs can perceive, those composed of carbohydrate moieties are poorly studied. Only a limited number of PRR/glycan pairs have been identified and their triggered defense responses characterized. There is evidence for some similarities between the plant defense responses and animal innate immune system, most notably where specific pattern recognition occurs (Chapter 42). Plant defense responses upon glycan perception by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). These responses are initiated by a glycan generated by glycanases that fragment either the pathogen cell walls or the plant cell walls. The glycan interacts with specific (more...) Early studies showed that oligosaccharides derived from cell wall glycans of the plant or the pathogen elicit numerous plant defense responses at nanomolar/micromolar concentrations. Oligogalacturonides composed of 1-4-linked α-GalA residues are one example of oligosaccharins released from plant cell wall polysaccharides, in this specific case from homogalacturonans by endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) secreted by the pathogen. The activities of such pathogen-derived EPGs are frequently inhibited or modulated by polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIP) produced by plants. Similarly, oligoglucosides composed of 1-6- and 1-3-linked β-Glc residues released from the mycelial walls of the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae by plant endo-glucanases were an early example of oligosaccharins generated from a pathogen's cell wall. Other pathogen-derived oligosaccharins are the PAMPs derived from linear homo-oligomers from fungal/oomycete cell walls that include chitin [1,4-β-D-(GlcNAc)n], and its deacetylated form (chitosan), and β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2). More recently, additional plant cell wall–derived oligosaccharins have been shown to trigger defense responses, including cellulose-derived oligomers (β-1,4-glucans), mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs: β-1,4/β-1,3 glucans), and oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucans, mannans, xylans, or callose, which trigger signaling cascades in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including crops (Figure 40.2). It has recently been shown that at least some “self” immune-active plant glycans are released in a regulated manner as part of normal plant developmental pathways and are not necessarily tied to cell-wall damage pathways (see below). It is also noteworthy that some immune-active oligosaccharides can be released from polymers present in the walls of both the pathogen and the plant. For example, β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides are released from callose, which is produced by plants and is also a component of many fungal and oomycete cell walls.""
 'Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides effectively protected grapevine and Arabidopsis against the fungal/oomycete pathogens, whereas β-1,3-glucans improved, among others, tobacco, and grapevine protection against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens. Given the high abundance of β-1,3-glucans in brown seaweed, laminarin-based products have been successfully developed for use in agriculture as activators of plant natural defense against pathogens. Similarly, pretreatments with cellobiose reduced growth of some pathogens on Arabidopsis seedlings, although high doses were required to observe such effects. In all of these cases, PRRs involved in the perception of these oligosaccharide structures that are active in generating these resistance responses in plants have not yet been characterized in detail. The examples given in this chapter indicate the diversity of free glycan structures that can function as signaling molecules. It is likely that further examples of glycan signals in both plant and animal cells, as well as in their interactions with microbes, will become apparent in the future. The authors appreciate the helpful comments, suggestions, and contributions from Xi Chen and Gabriel A. Rabinovich and by Laura Bacete.'
 'An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase. These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix. Sulfated GAGs also facilitate the formation of morphogen gradients in tissues during early development. Because the gradient determines cell specification during development, the glycan indirectly affects signaling responses in receptive cells. These examples do not exclude the possibility that sulfated glycosaminoglycans may act as ligands and induce signaling directly (e.g., by ligating receptors). In addition to mucins (Chapter 10), the innate immune system developed early in eukaryote evolution is a first line of defense against infection by microorganisms. A key feature of this system is its ability to distinguish self from infectious nonself. In more advanced eukaryotes, this is accomplished by receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns specific to the pathogens. Many of these PAMPs are glycans located on the surfaces of the microorganism. The glycans include the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycans and techoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria (Chapters 21 and 22) and the mannans and glucans of fungi, perceived by PRRs. Just as in plants (as described above), numerous PRRs are present in mammals that recognize diverse PAMPs and induce host-defense pathways, including TLRs and mannan-binding lectin (Chapter 42). Binding of PAMPs to TLRs activates various signaling pathways that induce inflammation and antimicrobial effector responses. Some TLRs are present on antigen-presenting cells and help to activate the adaptive immune response. TLRs also respond to tissue injury via binding of released hyaluronan fragments as DAMPs (Figure 16.6). One of the best-studied models of mammal innate immunity involves the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, which has a role in causing septic shock (see Chapter 42). Lipid A (endotoxin) is the glucosamine-based phospholipid anchor of LPS responsible for activating the innate immune system. Lipid A is an excellent PAMP as its structure is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. Picomolar concentrations of lipid A are detected by TLR-4. The LPS is first opsonized and complexed with another host cell-surface protein, CD14. The binding of LPS leads to recruitment of the adaptor proteins MyD88 and IRAK. This complex initiates a signaling cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately lead to the transcription of proinflammatory genes. In contrast to PAMPs and DAMPs, inhibitory Siglec receptors (Chapter 35) on mammal innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialylated glycoconjugates as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) and dampen unwanted immune reactions against the host. Details of the sialoglycan specificity involved require further investigation, but pathogens take advantage of the system via molecular mimicry (Chapters 7 and 42). Plants also exhibit a type of innate immunity that on activation could confer resistance to pathogen attack to the entire plant. Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides effectively protected grapevine and Arabidopsis against the fungal/oomycete pathogens, whereas β-1,3-glucans improved, among others, tobacco, and grapevine protection against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens.'
 ""The interaction between Rhizobium and the roots of legumes is an agriculturally and economically important symbiotic relationship because it enables the plant to fix atmospheric nitrogen. An early step in this process is the plant's recognition of lipooligosaccharide signals (Nod factors), which are produced by the bacteria (Figure 40.3). Nod factors have a chitin oligosaccharide backbone containing from three to five GlcNAc residues. However, the types of modifications of this backbone, which include methylation, acylation (typically with a C16 or C18 fatty acid), acetylation, carbamylation, sulfation, glycosylation, and the addition of glycerol, differ among Rhizobium strains. Generic structure of a Nod factor. Sites on the molecule where species-specific modifications can occur are designated by R1–R7. R1 = H or methyl; R2 = C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:3, C18:4, C20:3, or C20:4; R3 = H, carbamate; R4 = H, carbamate; R5 (more...) Nod factors are effective at subnanomolar concentrations, are host-specific, and stimulate numerous changes in the plant's root hairs and roots that allow the bacteria to enter the root cortex and induce the formation of nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs. The initiation of nodule formation and Rhizobium entry into the root are host strain–specific; this specificity is determined by the structure of the Nod factor produced by a particular Rhizobium strain and the ability of a leguminous species to recognize that signal. Genetic and biochemical approaches have been used to identify potential plant root Nod factor receptors and proteins involved in the signaling events. The putative receptors are transmembrane proteins with a serine/threonine receptor kinase motif on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and LysM domains that may recognize Nod factors on the exterior of the membrane. Two receptors (NFR5 and NFR1) have been reported to bind Nod factor directly at high-affinity binding sites, although only limited carbohydrate-binding studies were conducted. A lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolase (LNP) has been identified in legume roots and reported to bind Nod factors from Rhizobium symbionts of the plant species from which it was obtained. LNP is a peripheral membrane protein that may function in a receptor complex with one or more LysM-type proteins or act downstream of the Nod factor receptors. Rhizobium exopolysaccharides (EPS) also have important roles in the development of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. A root receptor–like kinase (EPR3) has been identified and shown to have a role in the recognition of the bacterial EPS. Thus, receptor-mediated recognition of Nod factors and EPS signals may be involved in plant-bacterial compatibility and bacterial access to legume roots. Several glycans have been shown to affect plant growth and plant organogenesis. Nanomolar concentrations of oligogalacturonides with a DP between 12 and 14 (Figure 40.2) induce flower formation but inhibit root formation. Oligogalacturonides also enhance cell expansion and thereby affect plant growth and development. Many of these effects may result from the ability of oligogalacturonides to alter the plant's responses to the hormone auxin. Oligogalacturonide receptor proteins (WAKs) have been reported to bind to cell wall pectin and thereby affect plant cell expansion. Auxin-induced elongation of pea stem segments is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of a nonasaccharide-rich fragment of xyloglucan (Figure 40.2). Plants may also use endogenous Nod-factor-like signals to regulate their growth and development. Recent work on plants with altered lignin structure/composition suggests that plants have the ability to monitor changes in the structures of their walls and to trigger responses distinct from those involved in plant defense. In this case, the released active oligosaccharides appear to be fragments of rhamnogalacturonans, which are distinct from the oligogalacturonides involved in plant defense.""]","Oligogalacturonides that are biologically active typically require a degree of polymerization (DP) of 10–14 for activity, whereas DPs of >7 and >4 are necessary for the oligochitosans and oligochitins, respectively.","The composition (monosaccharide units), degree of polymerization (DP), and branching of the oligosaccharins determine their biological activity in triggering plant defense.

What do glycosyltransferases do?,"['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.6 James M. Rini, Kelley W. Moremen, Benjamin G. Davis, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. In addition, there are a number of transferases that modify glycans by the addition of acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups. This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept.'
 'The lysozyme-type glycosyltransferases (CAZy family 51) are involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan and use lipid II (GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate) as donor substrate (Chapter 21). In addition to the lysozyme-type domain, these glycosyltransferases possess the jaw subdomain, which embeds in the extracellular face of the cytoplasmic membrane and provides access to the lipid II substrate. In a very recent advance, it has been shown that the dual activity glycosyltransferase-phosphorylases, important for the turnover of the storage polysaccharide mannogen and virulence in Leishmania parasites, possess a β-propeller fold catalytic domain not previously observed for a glycosyltransferase. Ribbon diagrams of representative GT-A, GT-B, GT-C, and lysozyme-type fold glycosyltransferases. The GT-A and GT-B structures correspond to those of rabbit β1-2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (PDB ID 1FOA) and T4 phage β-glucosyltransferase (more...) Glycosidases are a very large group of enzymes with more than 870,000 members falling into more than 170 CAZy database families (Chapter 8). Unlike the glycosyltransferases, members of this family have evolved independently many times, a fact reflected in the diverse array of three-dimensional structures observed for these enzymes. Glycosidases play important roles in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars and for the turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes. Glycosidases are also involved in the formation of intermediates that are used as substrates for glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of glycans. The use of glycosidases in this way is particularly important in the biosynthesis of N-glycan-containing glycoproteins in more evolutionarily advanced eukaryotes and is thought to be associated with the acquisition of complex N-glycans during the evolution of multicellular organisms. In this case, the nascent glycoprotein glycan, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-Asn, is trimmed by glucosidases and mannosidases in the ER and Golgi to generate substrates for the glycosyltransferases that lead to elaborated complex and hybrid-type N-glycans (Chapter 9). Glucosidase II, one of the two ER-resident glucosidases involved, also works in conjunction with UGGT during glycoprotein folding to allow repeated deglucosylation/reglucosylation during what has been termed the calnexin/calreticulin quality control cycle (Chapter 39). An interplay between glycosylation and deglycosylation is also found to occur with the O-GlcNAc moiety that appears in many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (transferred by O-GlcNAc transferase; Chapter 19). In this case, removal of the N-acetylglucosamine moiety by the glycosidase, O-GlcNAcase, provides a means of dynamically regulating the extent of O-GlcNAcylation and the diverse processes that it mediates. Glycosyltransferases catalyze their reactions with either inversion or retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon atom of the donor substrate (Figure 6.5). For example, β1-4 galactosyltransferase, an inverting glycosyltransferase, transfers galactose from UDP-α-Gal to generate a β1-4-linked galactose-containing product. Inversion of stereochemistry follows from the fact that the enzyme uses an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction mechanism in which an acceptor hydroxyl group attacks the anomeric carbon atom of UDP-Gal from one side and UDP leaves from the other (Figure 6.5A).'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17). Human chorionic gonadotropin showing the determinants of recognition used by glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase. Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'

Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages and glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages. The diversity of natural glycans is reflected by the numerous glycosyltransferases and glycosidases encountered in nature, each exhibiting a defined substrate specificity. Natural glycans are often encountered in heterogeneous form and often produced in minute amounts making their isolation and characterization from natural sources often cumbersome. Therefore, glycobiology relies heavily on synthetic glycans, and synthetic methodology to produce glycans has witnessed tremendous progress (see Chapter 53). Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases offer advantages in the construction of glycans as these biocatalysts are very powerful under controlled conditions. This chapter summarizes recent developments in the use of (mutant) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of tailored glycans, including combinations of both enzyme classes and in conjunction with chemically synthesized intermediates are presented. The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide. Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center.

(GCS) Glucosylceramide synthase, (UDP) uridine diphosphate glucose, (GBA) acid glucosylceramidase.  Glucosylceramide is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal exo-glucosidase, acid glucosylceramidase (GBA). Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water.'
 'In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.']","Glycosyltransferases are responsible for assembling monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains by catalyzing group-transfer reactions in which monosaccharide moieties are transferred from donor substrates to acceptor substrates.

 'As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4). After saponification, the intermediate undecasaccharide is expanded to well-defined oligosaccharide 9 making use of the substrate specificity of α-1,3-fucosyltransferase (α-1,3-FucT, introduction of two fucopyranoses), β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β-1,4-GalT, twice), β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminetransferase (β-1,3-GlcNAcT), and finally the sialyltransferase, ST6Gal-I. The chemoenzymatic strategy proved flexible and allowed for the generation of diverse N-glycans in which the reducing end is available for bioconjugation and for the preparation of glycan microarrays for protein binding studies. In contrast to glycosyltransferase-mediated reactions, in which the equilibrium is shifted predominantly to (natural) product formation because of the intrinsic reactivity of donor glycosides, the equilibrium in a glycosidase-mediated reaction can be influenced such that the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction. Under physiological conditions, with high water concentrations, glycosidases hydrolyze glycosidic linkages to produce the corresponding hemiacetal, either with retention (Figure 54.5A) or inversion of configuration at the anomeric center. Performing a glycosidase reaction in partly nonaqueous conditions, by addition of large excess of aglycon, by inducing kinetic conditions or by a combination of these allows for partial reversal of the reaction equilibrium. By this means and in a “transglycosylation” event, glycans can be constructed. Disadvantages of this method are that reaction conditions may be adverse to enzyme reactivity and/or stability and, moreover, that the formed product is in essence a substrate for glycosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis. This caveat can be circumvented by making use of mutant glycosidases (Figure 54.5B) in which the catalytic nucleophile in case of retaining glycosidases is mutated to an innocent bystander (depicted is an Asp to Ala substitution). Such a “glycosynthase” can be used to react a synthetic donor glycoside that bears the anomeric configuration corresponding to the intermediate enzyme glycosyl covalent adduct (see Figure 54.1) with an appropriate nucleophile to construct a desired glycosidic linkage. The main advantage of this strategy is that, in principle, the mutant glycosidase has largely lost the ability to hydrolyze the formed product, because of the absence of the catalytic nucleophile. Many retaining glycosidases and, in recent years, inverting glycosidases have been mutated to glycosynthases, which have been used to produce a diverse array of glycans. (A) Equilibrium in a retaining β-glucosidase. (B) Mutant-retaining β-glucosidase in which the catalytic nucleophile is substituted for a nonparticipating amino acid allows for the construction of β-glucosides.  The strategy is exemplified by the synthesis of flavonoid glucoside 13 (Figure 54.6). Synthetic α-fluorolactoside 10 is treated with phenol 11 in the presence of the E197S mutant of the Humicola insolens Cel7B endoglucosidase. This glycosynthase proved highly flexible with respect to the acceptor phenol, allowing for the construction of a small library of flavonoid glycosides represented by phenolic disaccharide 12. Subsequent enzymatic removal of the nonreducing galactospyranoside provided flavonoid glucoside 13. Glycosynthase-mediated synthesis of flavonoid glycosides.'
 ""The O-xylose-linked GAG chains (DS, CS, and HS) all share a common core tetrasaccharide: GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ-O-Ser. An endo-β-xylosidase has been detected in rabbit liver. How the linkage regions are degraded is not established. A very rare human disorder is multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD). All sulfatases are casualties of this defect because they all undergo a posttranslational conversion of an active site cysteine residue to a Cα-formylglycine (2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid) catalyzed by the Cα-formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is essential for activity. In essence, the SH group of cysteine is replaced by a double-bonded oxygen atom that probably acts as an acceptor for cleaved sulfate groups. Loss-of-function mutations in the FGE gene lead to inactive sulfatases. This deficit affects GAG degradation and any other sulfated glycan such as sulfatides. Glycosphingolipids (Chapter 11) are degraded from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases while they are still bound to the lipid moiety ceramide. Because glycosphingolipids share some of the same outer sugar sequences found in N- and O-glycans (Chapter 14), many of the same glycosidases are used for their degradation (Figure 44.4). However, specific hydrolases cleave the glucose–ceramide and galactose–ceramide bonds. Besides specific enzymes, noncatalytic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) help to present the lipid substrates to enzymes for cleavage. Ceramide glycanase (endoglycoceramidases) from leeches and earthworms release the entire glycan chain from the lipid, much like PNGase releases N-glycans from proteins. Degradation of glycosphingolipids. Required activator proteins are shown in parentheses and individual enzymes are as shown in previous figures in this chapter. (SAP) Saposin.  Some exoglycosidases are unique to glycolipid degradation, and their absence causes glycolipid storage diseases (Table 44.3). Glucocerebrosidase, also called β-glucoceramidase, is specific for the degradation of the GlcβCer bond. The loss of this enzyme causes Gaucher's disease. Heterozygous mutations in this enzyme have been shown to be among the most prevalent and robust genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease, highlighting a role for glycolipid degradation in the context of more common neurological disorders. A specialized β-galactosidase, β-galactoceramidase, hydrolyzes the bond between galactose and ceramide and can also cleave the terminal galactose from lactosylceramide. Loss of this enzyme produces Krabbe disease. Galactosylceramide is often found with a 3-sulfate ester (sulfatide) and a specific sulfatase (arylsulfatase A) is needed for its removal before β-galactosylceramidase action. Loss of this sulfatase causes metachromatic leukodystrophy and the accumulation of sulfatide. Glycolipids terminated with α-galactose residues (globo-series; Chapter 11) are degraded by a specific α-galactosidase, the loss of which causes Fabry disease. Sugars that lie too close to the lipid bilayer apparently give limited access to soluble lysosomal enzymes, and additional proteins called saposins are required to present the substrates to the enzymes. Saposins (SAPs), also called “liftases,” form complexes with multiple degradative enzymes for more efficient hydrolysis of short glycolipids close to the membrane.""

For example, β1-4 galactosyltransferase, an inverting glycosyltransferase, transfers galactose from UDP-α-Gal to generate a β1-4-linked galactose-containing product. Inversion of stereochemistry follows from the fact that the enzyme uses an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction mechanism in which an acceptor hydroxyl group attacks the anomeric carbon atom of UDP-Gal from one side and UDP leaves from the other (Figure 6.5A).'

This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid.

What donor substrates do glycosyltranferases transfer monosaccharides from?,"['In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.'

 'Mannose released from N-glycan processing or turnover is transported out of the cell by a hexose transporter/exchanger with little or no direct reutilization. Glycan salvage pathways are clinically exploited to mitigate the impact of certain rare congenital disorders of glycosylation that target sugar biosynthesis or transport (Chapter 45). Experimentally, salvage pathways are used to manipulate nucleotide sugar pools, to incorporate glycans with biorthogonal chemical handles (Chapter 56), and to generate metabolic glycosyltransferase inhibitors (Chapter 55). Glycogen is an immense molecule that contains up to 100,000 glucose units, arranged in Glcα1–4Glc repeating disaccharides with periodic α1–6Glc branches. It is synthesized on a cytoplasmic protein called glycogenin (Chapter 18). Glycogen is the major storage polysaccharide in animal cells, and its synthesis and degradation (glycogenolysis) are highly regulated for energy use. Glycogen is synthesized by the addition of single glucose units from UDP-Glc, and it is degraded by glycogen phosphorylase. This ATP-independent reaction forms glucose-1-P by phosphorolysis of glycogen. This substrate can be used directly to form UDP-Glc or converted to glucose-6-P for further catabolism via glycolysis or direct oxidation via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucose is the central monosaccharide in carbohydrate metabolism, and it can be converted directly or indirectly into all other sugars (Figure 5.1). Glucose is first converted to glucose-6-P by hexokinase. In the glycolytic pathway, glucose-6-P is converted to fructose-6-P by phosphoglucose isomerase or into glucose-1-P by phosphoglucomutase. Reaction of glucose-1-P with UTP by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase forms the high-energy donor UDP-Glc. The UDP-Glc pool is used to synthesize glycogen and other glucose-containing molecules such as glucosylceramide (Chapter 11) and dolichol-P-glucose, which is used in the N-linked glycan biosynthetic pathway (Chapter 9). Biosynthesis and interconversion of monosaccharides. The relative contributions of each pathway under physiological conditions are unknown. (Rectangles) donors; (ovals) monosaccharides; (asterisks) control points; (Kdn) 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic (more...) Glucose-6-phosphate is also the substrate for glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, the entry point for its oxidation via the pentose phosphate pathway that subsequently produces 6-phosphogluconate and then ribose-5-phosphate. These reactions generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is needed to maintain proper redox status. UDP-GlcA (glucuronic acid) is synthesized directly from UDP-Glc by a two-stage reaction requiring two NAD+-dependent oxidations at C-6. UDP-GlcA is used primarily for GAG biosynthesis (Chapters 16 and 17), but some N- and O-linked glycans and glycosphingolipids contain glucuronic acid as well. In liver cells, the addition of glucuronic acid to bile acids and xenobiotic compounds (such as drugs and toxins) increases their solubility, and a large class of microsomal glucuronosyltransferases is devoted to these reactions. Iduronic acid is the C-5 epimer of GlcA, and it is found in GAGs dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin. Iduronic acid is not directly synthesized from a nucleotide sugar donor. Instead, it is generated by epimerization of GlcA following its incorporation into the growing GAG chain (Chapter 17). Decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA generates UDP-Xyl, which is used to initiate GAG synthesis (Figure 5.2; Chapter 17) in vertebrates.'
 'GLUT family transporters were first described in yeast, where at least 18 genes are known. Humans have 14 GLUT homologs. GLUT transporters range in size from ∼40 to 70 kDa and have a similar structure, containing 12 membrane-spanning domains, which is typical of many eukaryotic transporters. The transmembrane domains form a barrel with a small pore for sugar passage. Compared with GLUT1, the other family members have a modest (28%–65%) amino acid identity. There are “sugar transporter signatures” consisting of one or a few amino acids in specific positions relative to the membrane-spanning domains, but no major transporter motifs. Typically, the GLUTs have Km values for glucose uptake in the 1–20 mm range. In yeast, many transport glucose, but others are specific for galactose, fructose, or disaccharides. Most mammalian GLUT proteins transport glucose or fructose with variable efficiency but without fully characterized specificity in physiological contexts. However, GLUT5 primarily transports fructose, and the GLUT called HMIT is a proton-coupled myo-inositol transporter. GLUT2 also efficiently transports glucosamine. Glucose is transported from the gut lumen by the energy-requiring SGLT-1 and is recovered from the kidney filtrates by a related transporter, SGLT-2. The SGLT-type transporters have Km values of <1 mm for glucose. GLUT1–5 have different distributions among different mammalian cells and different Km values that enable them to respond to the availability of glucose. Although most of the human GLUT members are located on the cell surface, a portion of GLUT4 resides in intracellular vesicles, which are recruited to the cell surface in response to insulin. Following carbohydrate-rich meals, glucose transported by SGLT-1 in the intestine is thought to promote the recruitment of GLUT2 to the apical surface for enhanced glucose uptake. Monosaccharides can be salvaged from glycans degraded within cells (Chapter 44). Most of the degradation occurs at low pH in lysosomes. Salvage pathways have received relatively little attention, but their contribution to glycosylation may be quite substantial. For example, 80% of the radiolabeled N-acetylglucosamine from glycoproteins degraded in liver lysosomes is converted into UDP-GlcNAc, and at least one-third is used to synthesize secreted glycoproteins. Also, fibroblasts endocytose labeled glycans and reuse about 50% of the amino sugars for de novo glycoprotein synthesis. Efficient salvage is not limited to GlcNAc. Much of the sialic acid derived from endocytosed extracellular glycans may be reused. Monosaccharides released by degradation must exit the lysosome. Different lysosomal carriers exist for neutral hexoses (glucose, mannose, and galactose), N-acetylated amino sugars, and acidic sugars; the neutral sugar carrier has a Km value of 50–75 mm for hexose substrates, but also transports fucose and xylose. The N-acetylhexosamine carrier (Km ∼ 4 mm) cannot transport nonacetylated amino sugars. The sialic acid and glucuronic acid carrier (Km ∼ 300–550 µm) is important because its loss leads to an accumulation of these sugars in the lysosome and secretion into the urine, with genetic mutations resulting in a human lysosomal storage disease (Chapter 44). Most monosaccharides that reach the cytoplasm are activated and reused, as described below. However, the uronic acids cannot be reused in animals and are degraded via the pentose phosphate pathway. Mannose released from N-glycan processing or turnover is transported out of the cell by a hexose transporter/exchanger with little or no direct reutilization. Glycan salvage pathways are clinically exploited to mitigate the impact of certain rare congenital disorders of glycosylation that target sugar biosynthesis or transport (Chapter 45). Experimentally, salvage pathways are used to manipulate nucleotide sugar pools, to incorporate glycans with biorthogonal chemical handles (Chapter 56), and to generate metabolic glycosyltransferase inhibitors (Chapter 55).'

In nature, most glycans are synthesized by glycosyltransferases, enzymes that transfer activated forms of monosaccharides from nucleotide sugars and lipid-linked sugar intermediates to acceptors, including proteins, lipids, and growing glycan chains. Monosaccharide precursors are imported into the cell, salvaged from degraded glycans, or created enzymatically from other sugars within the cell. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation occurs mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, whereas monosaccharide activation and interconversions occur mostly in the cytoplasm. Nucleotide sugar–specific transporters carry activated sugar donors into the Golgi and to a lesser extent into the ER. In some cases, nucleotide sugars are used to synthesize activated lipid-linked intermediates before glycan transfer. This chapter describes how cells accomplish these tasks, with an emphasis on animal cells. Glucose and fructose are the major carbon and energy sources for organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Most organisms can synthesize the other monosaccharides needed for glycan biosynthesis from these sources. Not all of these biosynthetic pathways are equally active in all types of cells. However, there are some general principles. Monosaccharides must be activated to a high-energy donor for use in glycan synthesis. This process requires nucleoside triphosphates (typically UTP or GTP) and a glycosyl-1-P (monosaccharide with a phosphate at the anomeric carbon). They can be activated by a kinase (reaction 1) or generated from a previously synthesized activated nucleotide sugar (reactions 2 and 3):    The most common nucleotide sugar donors in animal cells are shown in Table 5.1. Sialic acids and their evolutionary ancestors (prokaryotic nonulosonic acids and Kdo) are the only monosaccharides in animals activated as CMP-mononucleotides. Iduronic acid does not have a nucleotide sugar parent because it is formed by epimerization of glucuronic acid after it is incorporated into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In some instances, one nucleotide sugar can be formed from another either by direct epimerization (reaction 2 above) or by a nucleotide exchange reaction (reaction 3 above). For example, UDP-Gal is made from UDP-Glc by exchange of Gal-1-P for Glc-1-P. Activated sugar donors in animal cells  Three types of sugar transporters carry sugars across the plasma membrane into cells. First are energy-independent facilitated diffusion transporters, such as the glucose transporter (GLUT) family of hexose transporters found in yeast and most mammalian cells. The genes encoding these proteins are named SLC2A (solute carriers 2A). Second are energy-dependent transporters—for example, the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT; gene names SLC5A) in intestinal and kidney epithelial cells. The third type includes transporters that couple ATP-dependent phosphorylation with sugar import. These are found in bacteria (Chapter 21) and are not covered in this chapter. GLUT family transporters were first described in yeast, where at least 18 genes are known. Humans have 14 GLUT homologs. GLUT transporters range in size from ∼40 to 70 kDa and have a similar structure, containing 12 membrane-spanning domains, which is typical of many eukaryotic transporters.

 'The carboxylic acid formed by oxidation of the aldehyde in an aldose is referred to as a glyconic acid (e.g., gluconic acid is the oxidation product of glucose). It is also possible to oxidize the hydroxyl groups of monosaccharides, most notably the terminal OH group (i.e., C-6 of glucose). In this reaction, a glycuronic acid is produced, and if both terminal groups are oxidized, the product is a glycaric acid. The three acids derived from D-glucose are illustrated in Figure 2.10. These compounds have a tendency to undergo intramolecular cyclization reactions, preferably yielding six-membered lactones. Two examples of lactonized forms are shown in Figure 2.11. Oxidized forms of monosaccharides can be found in nature. For example, GlcA is an abundant component of many glycosaminoglycans (see Chapter 17). Oxidized forms of D-glucose.  Conversion of a monosaccharide to a tritium-labeled alditol by reduction with NaB3H4.  The carbonyl groups of aldoses and ketoses also can be reduced with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to form polyhydroxy alcohols, referred to as alditols. This reaction is widely used to introduce a radiolabel at C-1 of the monosaccharide by reduction with NaB3H4 (Figure 2.11). The aldehyde and ketone groups of monosaccharides can also undergo Schiff base formation with amines or hydrazides, forming imines and hydrazones, respectively (Figure 2.12). This reaction is often used to conjugate the monosaccharide to proteins (via their lysine residues) or to biochemical probes such as biotin hydrazide. It should be noted that the imines formed with amino groups are not stable to water and are typically reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3) in a process termed reductive amination. Conjugation of a monosaccharide to an amino group by formation of an imine. The filled circle represents any small molecule or macromolecule containing an amine.  As aldehydes, reducing sugars can also form Schiff bases with amino groups of the lysine residues in proteins. This nonenzymatic process that links glycans to proteins is termed “glycation” and is distinct from “glycosylation,” which involves the formation of a glycosidic bond between the sugar and protein. Glycation products can undergo further reactions that lead to the formation of protein cross-links, and these can have pathogenic consequences (i.e., they are immunogenic and change the properties of the protein). Glycation products of glucose accumulate at higher levels in diabetics than in healthy individuals because of elevated blood glucose levels. These modified proteins are thought to underlie some of the pathologies associated with diabetes. Two monosaccharide units can be joined together by a glycosidic bond—this is the fundamental linkage among the monosaccharide building blocks found in all oligosaccharides. The glycosidic bond is formed between the anomeric carbon of one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group of another. In chemical terms, a hemiacetal group reacts with an alcohol group to form an acetal. Glycosidic bonds can be formed with virtually any hydroxylated compound, including simple alcohols such as methanol (Figure 2.13) or hydroxy amino acids such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Indeed, glycosidic linkages are formed between sugars and these amino acids within proteins to form glycoproteins (see Chapters 9 and 10). Like the hemiacetal, the acetal or glycosidic linkage can exist in two stereoisomeric forms: α and β. But unlike the hemiacetal, the acetal is configurationally stable under most conditions. Thus, once a glycosidic bond is formed, its configuration is maintained. Like acetals in general, glycosidic bonds can be hydrolyzed in dilute acid, generating the constituent monosaccharides from oligosaccharides.'
 'This SNi or SNi-like mechanism is supported by computational modeling and, in specific cases, by kinetic analyses and X-ray crystal structures of transition-state analog inhibitor complexes. On the basis of much structural and enzyme kinetic analysis, it is well established that inverting glycosidases proceed via a single SN2 displacement mechanism (Figure 6.5A), whereas retaining glycosidases use a double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (Figure 6.5B). In the double-displacement mechanism, an aspartic acid or glutamic acid side chain in the enzyme active site makes the first attack and inversion, followed by a second water-mediated attack (on the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate) and inversion, to give overall retention of stereochemistry. Using mechanism-based inhibitors, the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate has been trapped and studied by X-ray crystallography for a number of glycosidases. Many glycosyltransferases have been shown to possess a Bi-Bi sequential kinetic mechanism in which the donor substrate binds before the acceptor substrate, and the glycosylated acceptor is released before the nucleoside monophosphate or diphosphate, depending on the reaction. Such kinetics are readily explained by a structural model in which the active site represents a deep pocket, with the nucleotide sugar substrate at the bottom and the acceptor substrate stacked on top. If the acceptor substrate was to bind first, it would sterically preclude donor substrate binding and, as such, catalysis would not occur. Because of the stacked arrangement, it also follows that release of the glycosylated product must precede release of the nucleotide leaving group. Although largely consistent with such a model, the X-ray crystal structures of glycosyltransferase-substrate complexes also show that substrate-dependent ordering of flexible loops is a feature common to glycosyltransferases. Typically, donor substrate binding orders a loop(s) that in turn facilitates acceptor substrate binding. Moreover, loop ordering may serve to exclude bulk water from the active site, a strategy proposed to be used by most enzymes to create an active site environment that reduces the energy of the transition state and promotes catalysis. For glycosyltransferases, this would also serve to remove waters as a competing hydrolytic nucleophile, thereby favoring the acceptor substrate. The sulfotransferases are a large family of enzymes found in both the cytoplasm and the Golgi. Sulfotransferases play a particularly important role in the production of glycosaminoglycans (Chapter 17) and the formation of L-selectin ligands, glycans, and glycoconjugates required for the trafficking of lymphocytes across high-endothelial venules in lymph nodes (Chapter 34). All sulfotransferases use 3′-phospho-adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulfate donor (Chapter 5). Although the sequence similarity among sulfotransferases can be very low, they all possess conserved sequence motifs responsible for binding the 5′ and 3′ phosphate groups of PAPS. Moreover, structural analysis has shown that all of the sulfotransferases solved, to date, possess the same basic structure. Mechanistically, the enzyme proceeds via an SN2-like reaction, with the hydroxyl group of the acceptor making an in-line attack on the sulfate group, although it should be understood that substitution at sulfur may be mechanistically very different to that at carbon. Structural studies and mutagenesis have shown that a histidine residue serves to activate the hydroxyl nucleophile and that a lysine residue assists in stabilizing the PAP leaving group. Interestingly, a conserved serine residue seems to be involved in modulating the activity of these enzymes to prevent PAPS hydrolysis in the absence of acceptor substrate, another example of the need for enzymes to control the role of the competing water. Phosphorylation of sugar residues by ATP-dependent kinases occurs at C-2 of O-xylose in proteoglycans (Chapter 17) and at the C-6 position of O-mannose in α-dystroglycan after the mannose has been further glycosylated (Chapter 13).'
 'Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water. Although not necessarily relevant for the product formation in nature (sugar hemiacetals being prone to mutarotation at physiological pH), the different mechanisms employed by “retaining glycosidases” (involvement of a covalent intermediate) and “inverting glycosidases” (no covalent intermediate involved) bears consequences for their use in glycan synthesis. The use of Leloir-type glycosyltransferases in glycan synthesis requires access to the natural donor glycosides, which are sugar nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic advantage of glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis (excellent regio- and stereoselectivity) can be offset by the limitation on the access to the required donor glycosides. However, this challenge may be overcome by in situ biosynthesis/regeneration of the consumed sugar nucleotides. The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst. The resulting trisaccharide 3 is further extended with GDP-fucose 4 as the donor and recombinant fucosyltransferase (FucT) as the catalyst to deliver allyl sialyl-Lewis x. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x. (CMP) Cytidine monophosphate, (CDP) cytidine diphosphate, (CTP) cytidine triphosphate.  In the first step of the assembly line, the expensive sugar nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, is consumed, and on transfer of the sialic acid, cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is produced. With the aid of two consecutive kinases (nucleoside monophosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase), CMP can be transformed in situ into the corresponding triphosphate (CTP), which is then condensed by the enzyme CMP-sialic acid synthetase with sialic acid to regenerate CMP-Neu5Ac 2. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides.  The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans.  The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4).']","Glycosyltransferases transfer monosaccharides to acceptor substrates such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA.","Glycosyltransferases can transfer monosaccharides to other monosaccharides, proteins, lipids, and other moieties.",1.0,0.8565886054879516,0.8873665458207887,0.008264462809917356,0.99999999998,0.5
How do glycosyltransferases act to elongate glycan strucrures?,"['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.6 James M. Rini, Kelley W. Moremen, Benjamin G. Davis, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. In addition, there are a number of transferases that modify glycans by the addition of acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups. This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept.'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17). Human chorionic gonadotropin showing the determinants of recognition used by glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase. Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'

Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages and glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages. The diversity of natural glycans is reflected by the numerous glycosyltransferases and glycosidases encountered in nature, each exhibiting a defined substrate specificity. Natural glycans are often encountered in heterogeneous form and often produced in minute amounts making their isolation and characterization from natural sources often cumbersome. Therefore, glycobiology relies heavily on synthetic glycans, and synthetic methodology to produce glycans has witnessed tremendous progress (see Chapter 53). Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases offer advantages in the construction of glycans as these biocatalysts are very powerful under controlled conditions. This chapter summarizes recent developments in the use of (mutant) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of tailored glycans, including combinations of both enzyme classes and in conjunction with chemically synthesized intermediates are presented. The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide. Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center. The mechanisms employed by most Leloir glycosyltransferases are now resolved. Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide. (GCS) Glucosylceramide synthase, (UDP) uridine diphosphate glucose, (GBA) acid glucosylceramidase.  Glucosylceramide is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal exo-glucosidase, acid glucosylceramidase (GBA). Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water.'

 'The lysozyme-type glycosyltransferases (CAZy family 51) are involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan and use lipid II (GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate) as donor substrate (Chapter 21). In addition to the lysozyme-type domain, these glycosyltransferases possess the jaw subdomain, which embeds in the extracellular face of the cytoplasmic membrane and provides access to the lipid II substrate. In a very recent advance, it has been shown that the dual activity glycosyltransferase-phosphorylases, important for the turnover of the storage polysaccharide mannogen and virulence in Leishmania parasites, possess a β-propeller fold catalytic domain not previously observed for a glycosyltransferase. Ribbon diagrams of representative GT-A, GT-B, GT-C, and lysozyme-type fold glycosyltransferases. The GT-A and GT-B structures correspond to those of rabbit β1-2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (PDB ID 1FOA) and T4 phage β-glucosyltransferase (more...) Glycosidases are a very large group of enzymes with more than 870,000 members falling into more than 170 CAZy database families (Chapter 8). Unlike the glycosyltransferases, members of this family have evolved independently many times, a fact reflected in the diverse array of three-dimensional structures observed for these enzymes. Glycosidases play important roles in the degradation of glycan structures for the uptake and metabolism of sugars and for the turnover of glycoconjugates in various cellular processes. Glycosidases are also involved in the formation of intermediates that are used as substrates for glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of glycans. The use of glycosidases in this way is particularly important in the biosynthesis of N-glycan-containing glycoproteins in more evolutionarily advanced eukaryotes and is thought to be associated with the acquisition of complex N-glycans during the evolution of multicellular organisms. In this case, the nascent glycoprotein glycan, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-Asn, is trimmed by glucosidases and mannosidases in the ER and Golgi to generate substrates for the glycosyltransferases that lead to elaborated complex and hybrid-type N-glycans (Chapter 9). Glucosidase II, one of the two ER-resident glucosidases involved, also works in conjunction with UGGT during glycoprotein folding to allow repeated deglucosylation/reglucosylation during what has been termed the calnexin/calreticulin quality control cycle (Chapter 39). An interplay between glycosylation and deglycosylation is also found to occur with the O-GlcNAc moiety that appears in many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (transferred by O-GlcNAc transferase; Chapter 19). In this case, removal of the N-acetylglucosamine moiety by the glycosidase, O-GlcNAcase, provides a means of dynamically regulating the extent of O-GlcNAcylation and the diverse processes that it mediates. Glycosyltransferases catalyze their reactions with either inversion or retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon atom of the donor substrate (Figure 6.5). For example, β1-4 galactosyltransferase, an inverting glycosyltransferase, transfers galactose from UDP-α-Gal to generate a β1-4-linked galactose-containing product. Inversion of stereochemistry follows from the fact that the enzyme uses an SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reaction mechanism in which an acceptor hydroxyl group attacks the anomeric carbon atom of UDP-Gal from one side and UDP leaves from the other (Figure 6.5A).']","Glycosyltransferases act to elongate glycan structures by sequentially adding monosaccharide moieties to one another, forming linear and/or branched structures composed of linked monosaccharides. These enzymes show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, following a ""one enzyme–one linkage"" hypothesis. The product of one glycosyltransferase enzyme serves as the preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another, resulting in the elongation of the glycan chain.

What does the human blood group B alpha1-3 galactosyltransferase require to add galactose to a galactose acceptor substrate?,"['In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.'
 'Interestingly, in individuals that are “nonsecretors” and Lewis-negative, fucosylated glycans are not present beyond 2′-fucosyllactose, and the overall repertoire of oligosaccharides is reduced. Most other mammals synthesize lactose but also express species-specific repertoires of glycans that largely differ from humans—often being much simpler—but may have similar functions. Beside lactose, which is nutritionally important, the larger human milk oligosaccharides are thought to be important in infant immunoprotection and to have prebiotic activity by contributing to the development of healthy microbiota. Surprisingly, there is essentially no information on the hormone-regulated biosynthesis of these abundant glycans. Lactose is generated by a β1-4 galactosyltransferase (termed lactose synthase) only in the lactating mammary gland, because of the lactation-specific expression of the modifier protein α-lactalbumin, which causes the enzyme to transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to Glc rather than to GlcNAc. Even though this process has been demonstrated to occur in intact Golgi, the precise mechanisms of how lactose is modified by addition of other sugars by specific glycosyltransferases during lactation are unknown. It is assumed that the same enzymes involved in making termini of other glycan classes are responsible. The Galα1-3Gal epitope (often called “alpha-Gal”) is synthesized on Type-2 units on glycolipids and glycoproteins by a specific α1-3GalT (Figure 14.8). This epitope and the α1-3GalT that synthesizes it are expressed by New World primates and many nonprimate mammals, but the α1-3GalT gene (GGTA1) is inactivated in humans and Old World primates. Mice engineered to lack the α1-3GalT develop cataracts. Species that do not express the Galα1-3Gal epitope, including humans, carry anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies, likely because of immunization through exposure to the Galα1-3Gal epitope on microbes and food. Anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies present a major barrier to the use of porcine and other nonprimate organs for xenotransplantation in humans, because they bind to Galα1-3Gal epitopes on the vascular endothelium of xenotransplants and cause hyperacute graft rejection through complement-mediated endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Efforts are in progress to overcome this barrier by using animal organ donors that have been genetically modified. Approaches include transgenic expression of enzymes, such as FUT1, that diminishes Galα1-3Gal expression by diverting Type-2 units toward H antigen synthesis. Unfortunately, pig tissues lacking Galα1-3Gal elicit a graft rejection reaction to other pig antigens. Anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies have also been shown to significantly diminish the infective efficiency of recombinant retroviruses. The problem has been solved through the generation of packaging cell lines that are deficient in α1-3GalT. Allergic reactions toward therapeutic monoclonal antibodies expressing Galα1-3Gal first illustrated the importance of preparing recombinant glycoproteins for therapeutic use in humans in cells that do not express α1-3GalT. Severe allergies to red meat consumption can occur when high titer IgE antibodies against this epitope appear in adult humans, claimed to be the consequence of a prior bite by the Lone Star tick, which may be expressing the same epitope in its saliva. Structure and synthesis of the Galα1-3Gal antigen. The α1-3GalT uses unsubstituted Type-2 units on glycoproteins or glycolipids (R) to form the Galα1-3Gal terminal epitope. The glycolipid globoside serves as the substrate for the (more...) The Forssman antigen (also known as globopentosylceramide) is a glycolipid that contains terminal α1-3GalNAc linked to the terminal GalNAc of globoside transferred by the α1-3 GalNAcT GBGT1, which is related in sequence to ABO transferases (Figure 14.8).'
 'The enzyme has low in vitro activity but must be highly efficient in vivo because colonic mucins are rich in core 3 O-GalNAc glycans. The expression and activity of B3GNT6 is especially low in colonic tumors and virtually absent from tumor cells in culture. Overexpression of the enzyme in colon cancer cells decreases their ability to metastasize. Mice deficient in B3GNT6 show increased susceptibility to colitis and tumor development. The synthesis of core 4 by the M-type GCNT3 requires the prior synthesis of a core 3 O-GalNAc glycan (Figure 10.3). Transfection of colon cancer cells HCT116 with GCNT3 suppresses cell growth and invasive properties. In a xenograft model in nude mice, transfection with GCNT3 also suppresses tumor growth. Thus, both core 3 and 4 O-GalNAc glycans repress tumor progression, although the mechanisms of repression are not clear. The elongation of O-GalNAc glycans is catalyzed by families of β1-3 GlcNAc-transferases and β1-3 and β1-4 Gal-transferases to form repeated type 1 and 2 poly-N-acetyllactosamines (Table 10.1). Although most of the extension enzymes act on a number of different glycans, core 3 is a preferred acceptor for β3GalT5 (B3GALT5). In addition, the Galβ1-3 residues of core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans are preferred substrates for the elongation enzyme β1-3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3 (B3GNT3). Less common elongation reactions are the formation of GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc) and Galβ1-3GlcNAc- sequences. Linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine units can be branched by members of the β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family (e.g., GCNT2), resulting in the I antigen (Table 10.2). Most of these elongation and branching reactions also occur on O- and N-glycans and glycolipids. Some sialyltransferases and sulfotransferases prefer O-GalNAc glycans as substrates but many of these enzymes have an overlapping specificity and also act on N-glycans. A family of α2-6 sialyltransferases (ST6GALNAC1–ST6GALNAC4) with distinct specificities synthesizes sialyl-Tn and sialylated core 1 O-GalNAc glycans. A family of α2-3 sialyltransferases is responsible for the synthesis of sialylated O-GalNAc glycans, with ST3GAL1 being mainly involved in the sialylation of the Galβ1-3 residue of core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans. Sialylation blocks the further linear extension of O-glycan chains. Sulfotransferases are localized in the Golgi and cap O-GalNAc glycans with a sulfate ester linked to the 3-position of Gal or the 6-position of GlcNAc. The sulfate group is transferred from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). This adds a negative charge to O-GalNAc glycans of lung, intestinal, and other mucins that has a considerable effect on the chemical and metal ion binding properties of these glycans. GAL3ST4 is the major sulfotransferase acting on the Gal residue of core 1 O-glycans. Skeletal type keratan sulfate (KS) is also an O-GalNAc-linked highly sulfated polysaccharide (Chapter 17). O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer.'
 'GAL3ST4 is the major sulfotransferase acting on the Gal residue of core 1 O-glycans. Skeletal type keratan sulfate (KS) is also an O-GalNAc-linked highly sulfated polysaccharide (Chapter 17). O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer. The α1-2 fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 synthesize the blood group H determinant of O-GalNAc glycans which can be converted by an α1-3 Gal-transferase to blood group B or by an α1-3 GalNAc-transferase to blood group A (Table 10.1). In addition, α1-3 and α1-3/4 fucosyltransferases synthesize the Lewis antigens (Table 10.1). A number of uncommon and antigenic sugars are also found on O-GalNAc glycans. For example, neuropilin-2 in the nervous system has core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans that carry polysialic acid residues synthesized by polysialytransferase IV (ST8SIA4). These highly charged glycans play a critical role in the negative regulation of cell adhesion during maturation of the nervous system. An α1-4 GlcNAc-transferase in gastric tissue adds GlcNAc in α1-4 linkage to β1-4 Gal in core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans. The α1-4 GlcNAc-containing glycans appear to inhibit colonization by Helicobacter pylori. The functions of O-GalNAc glycans are many and varied, depending on their structure and density, as well on as the protein to which they are attached. As mentioned above, in densely glycosylated proteins such as mucins, O-glycans aid in hydration, structural support, interaction with the microbiome, and protection from proteolysis. In contrast, the function of single sites of O-GalNAc glycosylation vary widely and are still being determined. For example, O-GalNAc glycosylation at one or a few sites in certain proteins has been shown to regulate proprotein convertase cleavage, shedding of ectodomains, ligand binding, and cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, influencing tissue formation and differentiation. Moreover, O-glycans, either in defined sites or clusters, may serve as carriers of terminal ligands such as blood type antigens like sialyl-Lewis x, which are important for host–pathogen interactions, and the circulation and homing of immune cells. The ligands for certain selectin-mediated interactions between endothelial cells and leukocytes require sialyl-Lewis x that is commonly attached to core 2 O-GalNAc glycans (Table 10.1). Finally, O-glycan terminal motifs on some immune cell subtypes can engage specific Siglecs and induce tolerance to self-antigens. Methods to determine the function of O-GalNAc glycans are diverse and include the use of biosynthetic inhibitors, the construction of cell lines that lack or overexpress specific enzymes in O-glycosylation pathways, the use of O-GalNAc glycan-specific lectins or antibodies, removal of specific sugar residues by glycosidases, and deletion/mutation of specific GALNTs in model organisms. For example, a critical role of O-GalNAc glycans in selectin-mediated cell adhesion was revealed by treating cells with GalNAc-O-benzyl, which is a competitive inhibitor of core 1 and core 2 synthesis. GalNAc-O-benzyl acts as a decoy substrate for C1GALT1 and thereby reduces the synthesis of core 1 and core 2 O-GalNAc glycans on glycoproteins. Inhibitor-treated cancer cells lose the ability to bind to E-selectin and endothelial cells in vitro. Cancer cells often express sialyl-Lewis x and may thus use the selectin-binding properties of sialyl-Lewis x as a mechanism to invade tissues.'
 'Distinct β1-6GlcNAcTs yield different types of β1-6-branched glycans (Figure 14.3). The i antigen is abundantly expressed on the surface of embryonic erythrocytes and on erythrocytes during times of altered erythropoiesis. Such cells are relatively deficient in the expression of the I antigen. However, during the first 18 months of life, I antigen reactivity on erythrocytes reaches adult levels, and i antigen reactivity declines to very low levels. This developmental regulation is presumed to be due to the regulated expression of GCNT2 or GCNT3, which both encode a β1-6GlcNAcT. Given the development regulation of I antigen expression, in practice, cord blood is used as a target source of the i antigen when testing whether an individual possesses anti-i antibodies. Rare individuals, who have hereditary persistence of the i antigen, never express the I antigen on erythrocytes and maintain embryonic levels of erythrocyte i antigen expression as adults. There is no obvious pathophysiology associated as yet with the absence of the I blood group in humans, although this phenotype can create challenges when testing patients for CAD. Blood group i and I antigen synthesis. Linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains (i antigen) synthesized on N- and O-glycans or glycolipids (R) may be modified by a β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GCNT2 or GCNT3). These enzymes transfer GlcNAc (more...) The ABO blood group antigens were discovered early in the 20th century by Karl Landsteiner and colleagues. They showed that humans could be divided into different groups according to the presence or absence of serum factors that would agglutinate red blood cells isolated from other humans. We now know that these serum factors are antibodies and that the corresponding antigens are glycan epitopes determined by the inheritance of genes that, for the most part, encode glycosyltransferases. The A, B, and H blood group antigens are glycans presented on Type-1 or Type-2 structures (Figure 14.2), on O-GalNAc glycans (Type-3), or on glycolipids (Type-4) (Figure 14.4). The blood group antigens are formed by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases encoded by the ABO, H, and Se genes, now termed the ABO, FUT1, and FUT2 loci (Figure 14.5). Blood group antigen synthesis begins with modification of Type-1 or Type-2 structures by the transfer of α1-2Fuc to Gal to form the blood group H determinant. The H allele encodes an α1-2FucT (FUT1) expressed in erythrocyte precursors and transfers Fuc to Type-2 and Type-4 glycan units to form the H antigen on erythrocytes (Figure 14.4). The Se allele encodes another α1-2FucT (FUT2) expressed in epithelial cells and uses Type-1 and Type-3 LacNAc to form the H antigen in epithelia lining the lumen of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive tracts and in salivary glands (Figure 14.4), as well as modifying milk oligosaccharides. Type-1, -2, and -3 H, A, and B antigens that form the O (H), A, and B blood group determinants on N- and O-glycans.

LN designates N-acetyllactosamine unit.  A or B blood group determinants are subsequently formed from H Type-1, -2, -3, or -4 determinants by glycosyltransferases encoded by the ABO locus. The A allele encodes the α1-3GalNAcT (A3GALNT) that generates the A glycan epitope forming the A blood group (Figure 14.5).']",The human blood group B alpha1-3 galactosyltransferase requires the galactose acceptor substrate to be modified by fucose in alpha1-2-linkage in order to add galactose.,The human blood group B alpha1-3 galactosyltransferase only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage.,1.0,0.9365057517046081,0.9085191634418774,0.017543859649122806,0.8874999999778125,1.0
Which glycosyltransferases add fucose to glycan strucures?,"['Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety. The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10). The polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases do not recognize a specific sequence motif and in general, they transfer N-acetyllgalactosamine to the side chain hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues found in relatively unstructured regions of the folded protein. Some polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases possess a lectin domain that serves to direct the glycosyltransferase to regions of the polypeptide that already possess O-glycan chains. In this way, regions of polypeptide that have a high degree of O-glycan substitution, typical of mucin structures, can be synthesized. In addition to the O-GalNAc linkage formed by the polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases, a number of other glycosyltransferases can glycosylate the side chain hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine to generate O-GlcNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc, O-Man, and O-Xyl linkages (Chapters 13, 17, and 19). Specificity for a particular serine or threonine residue is achieved in different ways. The xylosyltransferase that O-xylosylates a serine residue in chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, for example, has an absolute requirement for a glycine residue carboxy-terminal to the serine and/or more acidic residues in the vicinity of the glycosylation site. In contrast, the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), responsible for adding N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues on thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (Chapter 19), lacks any obvious consensus sequence associated with acceptor substrate binding specificity. See Table 6.1 for some amino acid–consensus sequences or glycosylation motifs used in the formation of glycopeptide bonds. Amino acid–consensus sequences or glycosylation motifs for the formation of glycopeptide bonds  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident O-fucosyltransferases, POFUT1 and POFUT2, that specifically fucosylate epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), respectively (Chapter 13), differ fundamentally from most other glycosyltransferases. In addition to recognizing a specific sequence motif containing the target serine or threonine residue (Table 6.1), these enzymes only act on EGF-like domains and TSRs that are properly folded and disulfide-bonded. Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates.'
 'In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17). Human chorionic gonadotropin showing the determinants of recognition used by glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase. Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.6 James M. Rini, Kelley W. Moremen, Benjamin G. Davis, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. In addition, there are a number of transferases that modify glycans by the addition of acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups. This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept.'
 'A bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary N-glycan is shown in Figure 9.5, and it may be present in all of the more highly branched N-glycans. However, it is not usually extended. Branching and core modification of complex N-glycans. The hybrid and mature, biantennary, complex N-glycans shown in Figure 9.4 may contain more branches because of GlcNAc-transferases in the Golgi that act only after MGAT1 has acted. If the α-mannosidase (more...) Further sugar additions convert the limited repertoire of hybrid and branched N-glycans into an extensive array of mature, complex N-glycans comprising (1) sugar additions to the N-glycan core, (2) elongation of branching GlcNAc residues by sugar additions, and (3) “capping” or “decoration” of elongated branches. The major core modification in vertebrate N-glycans is the addition of α1-6Fuc to the Asn-linked GlcNAc in the N-glycan core (Figure 9.5). The α1-6 fucosyltransferase (FUT8) usually requires the prior action of MGAT1 (Figure 9.4). In invertebrate glycoproteins, both core GlcNAc residues may receive a Fuc in an α1–3 and/or α1-6 linkage (Chapters 25 and 26). In plants, Fuc is transferred to the Asn-linked GlcNAc only in α1-3 linkage (Chapter 24). Also, in plant and helminth glycoproteins, the addition of β1-2Xyl to the β-Man of the core is common. This xylosyltransferase also requires the prior action of MGAT1. Xylose has not been detected in vertebrate N-glycans. The majority of complex and hybrid N-glycans have extended branches that are made by the addition of Gal to the initiating GlcNAc to produce the ubiquitous building block Galβ1-4GlcNAc, referred to as a type-2 N-acetyllactosamine or “LacNAc” sequence (Figure 9.6). The sequential addition of LacNAc disaccharides gives tandem repeats termed poly-LacNAc. In some glycoproteins, β-linked GalNAc is added to GlcNAc instead of Gal, yielding antennae with a GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc) extension (Chapter 14). Typical complex N-glycans found on mature glycoproteins. A LacNAc unit (bracketed) on any branch may be repeated many times.  The most important “capping” reactions involve the addition of Sia, Fuc, Gal, GlcNAc, and sulfate to complex N-glycan branches. Capping sugars are most commonly α-linked and therefore protrude away from the β-linked poly-LacNAc branches, thus facilitating the presentation of terminal sugars to lectins and antibodies. Many of these structures are shared by N- and O-glycans and by glycolipids (Chapter 14). Terminal sialic acids can have further chemical modifications (e.g., O-acetylation) (Chapter 15). The various reactions described above potentially yield a myriad of complex N-glycans that differ in branch number, composition, length, capping arrangements, and core modifications. Some examples to illustrate this diversity are shown in Figure 9.6. Lysosomal hydrolases degrade proteins, lipids, and glycans in the lysosome. Many of these enzymes are targeted to lysosomes by a specialized trafficking pathway that requires phosphorylated oligomannose N-glycans. The phosphorylation step involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to C-6 of Man residues of oligomannose N-glycans on lysosomal hydrolases in the cis-Golgi by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (heterodimer of GNPTAB and GNPTG) (Figure 9.4).']",Fucosyltransferases III–VII add fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans.,Fucosyltransferases attach fucose to glycan chains,1.0,0.721288002235802,0.763551722979426,0.009259259259259259,0.99999999998,1.0
Which glycosyltransferases add galactose to glycan strucures?,"['Chemical derivatization of GalNAc at the reducing end helps in the separation and subsequent analysis of sugar composition and linkages by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) (Chapter 50). Another tool to isolate O-glycans with specific epitopes is affinity chromatography using lectins. For example, Helix pomatia agglutinin binds to terminal GalNAc, whereas peanut lectin binds to unsubstituted core 1 (Table 10.1). The structures of O-GalNAc glycans released from mucins and other glycoproteins may be determined by a combination of liquid or gas chromatography, MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The anomeric linkage of each sugar can be determined using specific glycosidases that distinguish between α- or β-linked sugars, and by one- and two-dimensional NMR methods (Chapter 50). The sites of O-GalNAc glycan modification in mucins are difficult to determine directly, but this has been achieved by sensitive MS methods and new enzymatic tools. A big step forward in understanding the extent of the O-GalNAc glycoproteome came with the proteome-wide mapping of O-GalNAc glycosylation sites. Several MS-based strategies have been applied including modifications of the endogenous glycan structures through chemical labeling, lectin enrichment of glycans derived from native or glycoengineered cells, or O-GalNAc-specific endo-peptidase treatment. Additionally, the use of mucin-type O-proteases (OpeRATOR and StcE) that specifically cleave N-terminal to an O-glycosylated Ser/Thr have aided in mapping sites of glycosylation. Based on these methodologies, we now know that >80% of the proteins passing through the secretory pathway are modified with O-GalNAc glycans, although the occupancy and the nature of an O-GalNAc glycan associated with a glycosylated site remains elusive. O-GalNAc glycans are added to Ser/Thr residues in proteins in the Golgi apparatus. The biosynthetic glycosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic tail at the amino terminus, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a catalytic domain in the lumen of the Golgi. The arrangement within Golgi membranes appears to be similar to an “assembly line” with early reactions occurring in the cis-Golgi and late reactions in the trans-Golgi (Chapter 4). Many of the enzymes, however, are diffusely distributed in Golgi compartments. The subcellular localization, activity levels, and substrate specificities of glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of O-GalNAc glycans play a critical role in determining the range of O-glycans synthesized by a cell (Table 10.2 and Figures 10.2 and 10.3). The glycosyltransferases that are involved in the assembly of O-GalNAc glycans are listed in Table 10.2. However, other enzymes that contribute to the synthesis of N-glycans and glycolipids also act on O-glycans, and some of these prefer O-glycans as acceptor substrates (Chapter 14). In vitro assays have shown that the activities of glycosyltransferases are controlled by factors such as metal ions and pH. Biosynthesis of core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans as described in the text. Green lines are protein.  Glycosyltransferases that synthesize O-GalNAc glycans  The first and essential step of O-GalNAc glycosylation is the addition of GalNAc in α-linkage to Ser or Thr by a polypeptide GalNAc-transferase (ppGalNAcT; GALNT) (Table 10.2; Figure 10.2). Humans have 20 genes encoding GALNTs. The large number of GALNTs provides redundancy and also reflects differences in substrate specificity. Studies in the fly indicate that certain GALNTs (PGANTs in the fly) are required for normal development (Chapter 26). Deletion of single GALNTs in mammals results in organ and cell differentiation defects.'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17). Human chorionic gonadotropin showing the determinants of recognition used by glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase. Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'
 'In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.'
 'Humans have 20 genes encoding GALNTs. The large number of GALNTs provides redundancy and also reflects differences in substrate specificity. Studies in the fly indicate that certain GALNTs (PGANTs in the fly) are required for normal development (Chapter 26). Deletion of single GALNTs in mammals results in organ and cell differentiation defects. The GALNTs are found throughout the animal kingdom but not in bacteria, yeast, or plants. All GALNTs are classified in the GT27 CaZy family with a GT-A fold (Chapter 8), and most have a lectin (ricin-like) domain at the carboxyl terminus, which is unique among glycosyltransferases. GALNTs coordinate the transfer of GalNAc from the donor substrate (UDP-GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr on acceptor substrates and fall into two general categories: those that require the presence of an extant GalNAc on a peptide or protein before they will add additional GalNAcs (glycopeptide-preferring transferases), and those that will transfer GalNAc to a modified or unmodified protein (peptide transferases). Crystal structures of a number of GALNTs have revealed key details in the mechanisms of action of these enzymes and their unique substrate specificities. The conserved DXH motif found in all GALNTs coordinates Mn++ and UDP-GalNAc binding. Acceptor substrate preferences are dictated by unique amino acids present within the catalytic domain of each GALNT. For example, some GALNTs have “proline pockets” within the catalytic domain, thus conferring a strong preference for Pro residues near the site of O-glycosylation. The lectin domain recognizes extant O-GalNAc residues on previously glycosylated substrates to position the catalytic domain for further GalNAc addition. More recent work has demonstrated that charged residues within the lectin domain can also influence the glycosylation of charged protein substrates (in the absence of prior glycosylation). Additionally, the flexible linker in between the catalytic and lectin domains (which varies in length and sequence among the GALNTs) has been shown to influence sites of GalNAc addition. Databases that estimate the likelihood of O-glycosylation at a specific site are based on known sequences around O-glycosylation sites, as well as in vitro determinations of sequence preferences for certain GALNTs (e.g., NetOGlyc and ISOGlyP). However, these predictions do not account for the different GALNTs expressed in the cell type producing a particular glycoprotein and do not apply to mucins. Because of overlapping localization of GALNTs and the extension enzymes, it is likely that a heterogeneous mixture of different O-GalNAc glycans is present on all mature glycoproteins. Also, the presence of O-GalNAc glycans on proteins is likely often missed because of this limited predictive value of surrounding amino acid sequence. As mentioned above, O-GalNAc glycan synthesis begins with the transfer of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to Ser/Thr catalyzed by a GALNT. Although a single, unextended GalNAc linked to Ser/Thr (the Tn antigen) is uncommon in normal mucins, it is often found at increased levels in tumor mucins. This suggests that the extension of O-GalNAc glycans beyond the first sugar is blocked in some cancer cells. Sia added to GalNAc by the α2-6 sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC1 generates the sialyl-Tn antigen, which is common in advanced tumors. Other sugars are not known to be added to this O-glycan, but it can be O-acetylated by Sia O-acetyltransferase, which prevents detection by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. The addition of one or two neutral sugars to O-GalNAc generates one of the different cores of O-GalNAc glycans (Table 10.1; Figure 10.2). Core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) is generated by C1GALT1.'
 'GAL3ST4 is the major sulfotransferase acting on the Gal residue of core 1 O-glycans. Skeletal type keratan sulfate (KS) is also an O-GalNAc-linked highly sulfated polysaccharide (Chapter 17). O-acetyltransferases that add O-acetyl esters to one or more hydroxyl groups of Sia residues remain poorly characterized. Some evidence suggests that the esters can be added to CMP-Sias before transfer. The α1-2 fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2 synthesize the blood group H determinant of O-GalNAc glycans which can be converted by an α1-3 Gal-transferase to blood group B or by an α1-3 GalNAc-transferase to blood group A (Table 10.1). In addition, α1-3 and α1-3/4 fucosyltransferases synthesize the Lewis antigens (Table 10.1). A number of uncommon and antigenic sugars are also found on O-GalNAc glycans. For example, neuropilin-2 in the nervous system has core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans that carry polysialic acid residues synthesized by polysialytransferase IV (ST8SIA4). These highly charged glycans play a critical role in the negative regulation of cell adhesion during maturation of the nervous system. An α1-4 GlcNAc-transferase in gastric tissue adds GlcNAc in α1-4 linkage to β1-4 Gal in core 1 and 2 O-GalNAc glycans. The α1-4 GlcNAc-containing glycans appear to inhibit colonization by Helicobacter pylori. The functions of O-GalNAc glycans are many and varied, depending on their structure and density, as well on as the protein to which they are attached. As mentioned above, in densely glycosylated proteins such as mucins, O-glycans aid in hydration, structural support, interaction with the microbiome, and protection from proteolysis. In contrast, the function of single sites of O-GalNAc glycosylation vary widely and are still being determined. For example, O-GalNAc glycosylation at one or a few sites in certain proteins has been shown to regulate proprotein convertase cleavage, shedding of ectodomains, ligand binding, and cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, influencing tissue formation and differentiation. Moreover, O-glycans, either in defined sites or clusters, may serve as carriers of terminal ligands such as blood type antigens like sialyl-Lewis x, which are important for host–pathogen interactions, and the circulation and homing of immune cells. The ligands for certain selectin-mediated interactions between endothelial cells and leukocytes require sialyl-Lewis x that is commonly attached to core 2 O-GalNAc glycans (Table 10.1). Finally, O-glycan terminal motifs on some immune cell subtypes can engage specific Siglecs and induce tolerance to self-antigens. Methods to determine the function of O-GalNAc glycans are diverse and include the use of biosynthetic inhibitors, the construction of cell lines that lack or overexpress specific enzymes in O-glycosylation pathways, the use of O-GalNAc glycan-specific lectins or antibodies, removal of specific sugar residues by glycosidases, and deletion/mutation of specific GALNTs in model organisms. For example, a critical role of O-GalNAc glycans in selectin-mediated cell adhesion was revealed by treating cells with GalNAc-O-benzyl, which is a competitive inhibitor of core 1 and core 2 synthesis. GalNAc-O-benzyl acts as a decoy substrate for C1GALT1 and thereby reduces the synthesis of core 1 and core 2 O-GalNAc glycans on glycoproteins. Inhibitor-treated cancer cells lose the ability to bind to E-selectin and endothelial cells in vitro. Cancer cells often express sialyl-Lewis x and may thus use the selectin-binding properties of sialyl-Lewis x as a mechanism to invade tissues.']","The glycosyltransferases that add galactose to glycan structures include the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase, fucosyltransferases III–VII, α2-3 sialyltransferases, and β1-4 galactosyltransferases.",Galactosyltransferases attach galactose to glycan chains,0.0,0.9645168641984448,0.7250854105630921,0.045454545454545456,0.8333333332916666,0.0
Which glycosyltransferases add glycose to glycan strucures?,"['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.6 James M. Rini, Kelley W. Moremen, Benjamin G. Davis, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. In addition, there are a number of transferases that modify glycans by the addition of acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups. This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis.

 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified.

 'Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety. The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10). The polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases do not recognize a specific sequence motif and in general, they transfer N-acetyllgalactosamine to the side chain hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues found in relatively unstructured regions of the folded protein. Some polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases possess a lectin domain that serves to direct the glycosyltransferase to regions of the polypeptide that already possess O-glycan chains. In this way, regions of polypeptide that have a high degree of O-glycan substitution, typical of mucin structures, can be synthesized. In addition to the O-GalNAc linkage formed by the polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases, a number of other glycosyltransferases can glycosylate the side chain hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine to generate O-GlcNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc, O-Man, and O-Xyl linkages (Chapters 13, 17, and 19). Specificity for a particular serine or threonine residue is achieved in different ways. The xylosyltransferase that O-xylosylates a serine residue in chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, for example, has an absolute requirement for a glycine residue carboxy-terminal to the serine and/or more acidic residues in the vicinity of the glycosylation site. In contrast, the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), responsible for adding N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues on thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (Chapter 19), lacks any obvious consensus sequence associated with acceptor substrate binding specificity. See Table 6.1 for some amino acid–consensus sequences or glycosylation motifs used in the formation of glycopeptide bonds.

In addition to recognizing a specific sequence motif containing the target serine or threonine residue (Table 6.1), these enzymes only act on EGF-like domains and TSRs that are properly folded and disulfide-bonded. Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates.'

Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages and glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages. The diversity of natural glycans is reflected by the numerous glycosyltransferases and glycosidases encountered in nature, each exhibiting a defined substrate specificity. Natural glycans are often encountered in heterogeneous form and often produced in minute amounts making their isolation and characterization from natural sources often cumbersome. Therefore, glycobiology relies heavily on synthetic glycans, and synthetic methodology to produce glycans has witnessed tremendous progress (see Chapter 53). Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases offer advantages in the construction of glycans as these biocatalysts are very powerful under controlled conditions. This chapter summarizes recent developments in the use of (mutant) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of tailored glycans, including combinations of both enzyme classes and in conjunction with chemically synthesized intermediates are presented. The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide. Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center. The mechanisms employed by most Leloir glycosyltransferases are now resolved. Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide. (GCS) Glucosylceramide synthase, (UDP) uridine diphosphate glucose, (GBA) acid glucosylceramidase.  Glucosylceramide is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal exo-glucosidase, acid glucosylceramidase (GBA). Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water.']","Glycosyltransferases that add glycose to glycan structures include those responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. These enzymes assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains by catalyzing group-transfer reactions in which monosaccharide moieties are transferred to acceptor substrates. Additionally, glycosyltransferases can modify glycans by adding acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups.",Glucosyltransferases attach glucose to glycan chains,0.8,0.8672529546536574,0.7291107901145615,0.00909090909090909,0.99999999998,1.0
Which glycosyltransferases add mannose to glycan structures?,"['Many of these enzymes are targeted to lysosomes by a specialized trafficking pathway that requires phosphorylated oligomannose N-glycans. The phosphorylation step involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to C-6 of Man residues of oligomannose N-glycans on lysosomal hydrolases in the cis-Golgi by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (heterodimer of GNPTAB and GNPTG) (Figure 9.4). A phosphodiester N-acetylglucosamindase (NAGPA) in the trans-Golgi removes the GlcNAc to generate Man-6-P recognized by a Man-6-P receptor (M6PR). M6PRs transport lysosomal hydrolases to an acidified compartment which ultimately fuses with the lysosome. The details of this trafficking pathway are presented in Chapter 33. The glycosyltransferases in the ER are mainly multitransmembrane proteins woven into the ER membrane. In contrast, the glycosyltransferases in Golgi compartments are generally type II membrane proteins with a small cytoplasmic amino-terminal domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large lumenal domain that includes an elongated stem region extending from the membrane, and a globular catalytic domain (Chapter 6). The stem region is often cleaved by signal peptide peptidase-like proteases, particularly SPPL-3, releasing the catalytic domain into the lumen of the Golgi and allowing its secretion. Thus, extracellular soluble forms of many glycosyltransferases exist in tissues and sera and may function as transferases if nucleotide sugars are present extracellularly. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm, except for CMP-sialic acids, which are synthesized in the nucleus (Chapter 5). They are subsequently concentrated in the appropriate compartment following transport across the membrane by specialized nucleotide sugar transporters that translocate CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Fuc, and other nucleotide sugars. A few of these transporters can transport more than one nucleotide sugar. Each transporter is a multitransmembrane protein that usually contains 10 membrane-spanning domains. Some CMP-sialic acids can be further modified within the lumen of the Golgi by O-acetyl groups before transfer to a glycan acceptor (Chapter 15). Glycoproteins usually have a range of different N-glycans on a particular Asn-X-Ser/Thr N-glycosylation sequon, leading to glycan heterogeneity at each site. Furthermore, when there is more than one Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon per molecule, different molecules in a population may have different subsets of N-glycans on different sequons, leading to glycoprotein microheterogeneity. Glycoproteins that differ only in their N-glycan complement are termed glycoforms. The variation in N-glycans of a glycoprotein may be due to protein conformation affecting substrate availability for Golgi glycosidases or glycosyltransferases, nucleotide sugar metabolism, transport rate of the glycoprotein through the lumen of the ER and Golgi, and the proximity of an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon to a transmembrane domain. Also, localization of glycosyltransferases within subcompartments of the Golgi can determine which enzymes encounter N-glycan acceptors. It is important to note that glycosylation enzymes often compete for the same acceptor and that most glycosyltransferases and glycosidases require the prior actions of other glycosyltransferases and glycosidases before they can act (Figure 9.4). Determining the functions of N-glycans may be accomplished using inhibitors including tunicamycin, which blocks the first step of N-glycosylation, or castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, deoxymannojirimycin, kifunensine, and swainsonine, which block N-glycan processing; or glycosylation mutants of model organisms such as yeast, cultured mammalian cells, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, and mouse.'
 'In addition, the action of MAN1B1, MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 can all be blocked experimentally by the inhibitors, deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine, resulting in Man8-9GlcNAc2 on mature glycoproteins. Most mature glycoproteins have some oligomannose N-glycans that are not processed in the cis-Golgi. Biosynthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans (Figure 9.1) is initiated in the medial-Golgi by the action of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase called GlcNAc-TI (MGAT1), which adds a GlcNAc residue to the C-2 of the α1-3Man in the core of Man5GlcNAc2 (Figure 9.4). Subsequently, the majority of N-glycans are trimmed by α-mannosidase II enzymes (MAN2A1 or MAN2A2) in the medial-Golgi, which remove the terminal α1-3Man and α1-6Man residues from GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 to form GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2. It is important to note that α-mannosidase II cannot trim Man5GlcNAc2 unless it has been acted on by MGAT1. Once both Man residues are removed, a second GlcNAc is added to the C-2 of the α1-6Man in the N-glycan core by the action of GlcNAc-TII (MGAT2) to yield the precursor for all biantennary, complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans are formed if the GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 glycan produced by MGAT1 is not acted on by α-mannosidase II. Incomplete action of α-mannosidase II can result in GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc2 hybrids. Small oligomannose N-glycans have been found in relatively large amounts in invertebrates and plants. These Man3–4GlcNAc2 N-glycans (paucimannose N-glycans) are formed from GlcNAcMan3–4GlcNAc2 following removal of the peripheral GlcNAc by a Golgi hexosaminidase that acts after α-mannosidase II (Chapters 24 and 26). Paucimannose glycans are also found in mammals, and can be elevated in cancer, inflammation, and stem cell development. The complex N-glycan shown in the medial-Golgi of Figure 9.4 has two antennae or branches initiated by the addition of two GlcNAc residues. Additional branches can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-3Man by GlcNAc-TIV (MGAT4A, MGAT4B, MGAT4C) and at C-6 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TV (MGAT5) to yield tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans (Figure 9.5). MGAT5B or GlcNAc-TIX catalyzes the same reaction but preferentially on O-mannose glycans in brain. Another branch, found in birds and fish, can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TVI (MGAT6; Figure 9.5). Genes related to GlcNAc-TVI exist in mammalian genomes (MGAT4C). Complex and hybrid N-glycans may also carry a “bisecting” GlcNAc residue that is attached to the β-Man of the core by GlcNAc-TIII (MGAT3) (Figure 9.5). A bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary N-glycan is shown in Figure 9.5, and it may be present in all of the more highly branched N-glycans. However, it is not usually extended. Branching and core modification of complex N-glycans.'

Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are responsible for the assembly, processing, and turnover of glycans. In addition, there are a number of transferases that modify glycans by the addition of acetyl, methyl, phosphate, sulfate, and other groups. This chapter covers the general characteristics of enzymes involved in glycan initiation, assembly, and processing, including aspects of substrate specificity, primary sequence relationships, structures, and enzyme mechanisms. The biosynthesis of glycans is primarily determined by glycosyltransferases that assemble monosaccharide moieties into linear and branched glycan chains. As might be expected from the complex array of glycan structures found in nature, glycosyltransferases constitute a very large family of enzymes. In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter. Among these enzymes, the vast majority is responsible for elongating the glycan moieties of these glycoconjugates; the remainder is responsible for the transfer of either a mono- or oligosaccharide directly to the polypeptide or lipid. Generally speaking, the enzymes that elongate glycans act sequentially so that the product of one enzyme yields a preferred acceptor substrate for the subsequent action of another. The end result is a linear and/or branched structure composed of monosaccharides linked to one another. Acceptor recognition by these glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases does not typically involve the polypeptide or lipid moiety of the acceptor substrate when it exists, although there are several notable exceptions as discussed below. Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept.'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17). Human chorionic gonadotropin showing the determinants of recognition used by glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase. Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'
 'In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.']","MAN1B1, MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 are glycosyltransferases that add mannose to glycan structures.",Mannosyltransferases attach mannose to glycan chains,0.0,0.4692033645173316,0.7706699300895314,0.009433962264150943,0.8041666666465626,1.0
Which glycosyltransferases add sialic acids to glycan structures?,"['Phosphorylation of sugar residues by ATP-dependent kinases occurs at C-2 of O-xylose in proteoglycans (Chapter 17) and at the C-6 position of O-mannose in α-dystroglycan after the mannose has been further glycosylated (Chapter 13). Phosphoglycosylation (or glycophosphorylation), a process in which a sugar phosphoryl is transferred from a nucleotide sugar donor directly to a serine residue on a protein (e.g., GlcNAc-P-serine and Man-P-serine), occurs in Dictyostelium and Leishmania, respectively. In eukaryotic cells, mannose-6-phosphate on the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes occurs by a two-step process involving UDP-GlcNAc as the phosphate donor. In the first step, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase uses UDP-GlcNAc to generate GlcNAcα1-P-6-Manα1-(N-glycan), and in the second step the N-acetylglucosamine moiety is removed by a second enzyme to give P-6-Manα1-(N-glycan) (Chapter 33). Glycan O-acetylation occurs in bacteria and plants and the O-acetylation of sialic acids is found in bacteria, parasites, and vertebrates. The structure of a plant acetyltransferase suggests the use of a catalytic triad and a double-displacement mechanism for acetyl group transfer analogous to esterases and serine proteases. CASD1, the sialate O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) in humans is a multi-spanning membrane protein with a globular extramembranous catalytic domain. The enzyme transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac. As such, it is the sialytransferase-mediated delivery of 9-O-acetylated sialic to acceptor substrates that leads to the 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates observed. 9-O-acetylated sialic acid plays a role in CD22 signaling, a process regulated by the opposing action of a sialate 9-O-acetylesterase (SIAE). It also serves as receptor or coreceptor for influenza C and a number of coronaviruses. N-Deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine residues to glucosamine occurs during heparin/heparan sulfate formation (Chapter 17), lipopolysaccharide assembly (Chapters 21 and 22), and GPI-anchor synthesis (Chapter 12). The bacterial enzyme is zinc-dependent, but in-depth studies of the vertebrate N-deacetylases have not been performed. N-Deacetylation of N-acetylneuraminic acid (the most common sialic acid) has also been reported (Chapter 15). Finally, glycans can be modified in many other ways, including pyruvylation (e.g., in the formation of N-acetylmuramic acid; Chapters 21 and 22), the addition of ethanolamine phosphate (e.g., during GPI-anchor synthesis; Chapter 12), and alkylation, deoxygenation, and halogenation in microbial glycans. All of these reactions are catalyzed by unique transferases or oxidoreductases and represent areas of active research. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from David Vocadlo, Mike Ferguson, Susan Bellis, and Tetsuya Okajima.'
 'Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water. Although not necessarily relevant for the product formation in nature (sugar hemiacetals being prone to mutarotation at physiological pH), the different mechanisms employed by “retaining glycosidases” (involvement of a covalent intermediate) and “inverting glycosidases” (no covalent intermediate involved) bears consequences for their use in glycan synthesis. The use of Leloir-type glycosyltransferases in glycan synthesis requires access to the natural donor glycosides, which are sugar nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic advantage of glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis (excellent regio- and stereoselectivity) can be offset by the limitation on the access to the required donor glycosides. However, this challenge may be overcome by in situ biosynthesis/regeneration of the consumed sugar nucleotides. The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst. The resulting trisaccharide 3 is further extended with GDP-fucose 4 as the donor and recombinant fucosyltransferase (FucT) as the catalyst to deliver allyl sialyl-Lewis x. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x. (CMP) Cytidine monophosphate, (CDP) cytidine diphosphate, (CTP) cytidine triphosphate.  In the first step of the assembly line, the expensive sugar nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, is consumed, and on transfer of the sialic acid, cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is produced. With the aid of two consecutive kinases (nucleoside monophosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase), CMP can be transformed in situ into the corresponding triphosphate (CTP), which is then condensed by the enzyme CMP-sialic acid synthetase with sialic acid to regenerate CMP-Neu5Ac 2. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides.  The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans.  The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4).'

Glycosidases that remove monosaccharides to form intermediates that are then acted on by glycosyltransferases also play a role in the biosynthesis of some glycan types. These are to be contrasted with glycosidases that are involved in the degradation of glycans (e.g., in lysosomes [Chapter 44]). In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept.'
 'Glycan-based inhibitors are currently under evaluation in humans for their ability to diminish the symptoms and progression of cholera. A variety of other pathogens and toxins bind to sialylated termini bearing one of many possible modified sialic acids (Chapter 15). Sialic acid in α2-6 linkage is found on N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycolipids. Two α2-6 sialyltransferases, ST6GAL1 and ST6GAL2, transfer to Gal, whereas ST6GALNAC1–ST6GALNAC6 transfer to GalNAc (ST6GALNAC5 and ST6GALNAC6 also transfer to GlcNAc) (Figure 14.11). In vertebrates, α2-6 sialic acid is found on terminal Gal, on terminal or subterminal GalNAc, or, in the case of reactions catalyzed by ST6GALNAC3 and ST6GALNAC4, on a core GalNAc. α2-6 sialic acid is less common than α2-3 sialic acid in tissue glycoproteins but more common in plasma glycoproteins. Glycans with terminal α2-6 sialic acid are generally not modified further. In mouse, St6gal1 is expressed at a relatively high level in hepatocytes and lymphocytes and is responsible for α2-6 sialylation of serum glycoproteins and glycoproteins of the antigen receptor complex in lymphocytes. St6gal2 expression is mainly restricted to the embryonic and adult brain, and its functions are currently unknown. Synthesis of α2-6 and α2-3 sialic acid on O-glycans and glycolipids (see Chapters 9 and 10) by the ST3Gal and ST6GalNAc families of sialyltransferases. Enzymes in parentheses contribute at relatively low levels in vitro to the reactions (more...) The α2-6-sialylated glycans from ST6GALNAC1 and ST6GALNAC2 are restricted to O-glycans. ST6GALNAC3 and ST6GALNAC4 are responsible for transferring α2-6 sialic acid to the GalNAcα-Ser/Thr core of O-GalNAc glycans and to GalNAc in glycolipids. ST6GALNAC5 and ST6GALNAC6 appear to use glycolipids as preferred acceptors. Many strains of influenza infectious for humans bind terminal α2-6 sialic acid residues (Chapter 37), and glycoproteins bearing α2-6 sialylation can be cleared from the circulation by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Chapter 31). Mice lacking ST6GAL1 show diminished antibody responses to T-lymphocyte-dependent and -independent antigens, reduced B-lymphocyte proliferation response, reduced B-cell surface IgM and CD22 levels, ∼65% reduction in serum IgM levels, and reduced B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Chapter 35). The extracellular domain of CD22 on B lymphocytes specifically recognizes Siaα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc-. In the absence of α2-6 sialic acid on glycans, CD22 shows increased clustering with the BCR, and BCR signaling is down-regulated. The addition of α2-3 and α2-6 sialic acid may not only provide ligands for siglecs, but also may prevent terminal glycan recognition by several galectin family members, and perhaps other lectins. In this way, terminal sialylation can be viewed as an analogous regulatory pathway to intracellular phosphorylation, in which the addition and linkage of sialic acid can control the susceptibility of a wide variety of cell-surface glycans toward glycan binding protein-induced changes in cellular activity. Glycans modified by α2-8 polysialylation occur in vertebrates mainly in developing brain and are carried primarily on the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM. α2-8-sialylated glycans are also expressed on a few glycoproteins in nonneuronal cells and on tumor cells.']","ST6GAL1, ST6GAL2, ST6GALNAC1, ST6GALNAC2, ST6GALNAC3, ST6GALNAC4, ST6GALNAC5, and ST6GALNAC6 are glycosyltransferases that add sialic acids to glycan structures.",Sialyltransferases attach sialic acids to glycan chains,1.0,0.9484742841547718,0.6552347817165577,0.009345794392523364,0.99999999998,1.0
Which glycosyltransferases add N-acetylglucosamine to glycan structures?,"['Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17).

Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'
 'Many of these enzymes are targeted to lysosomes by a specialized trafficking pathway that requires phosphorylated oligomannose N-glycans. The phosphorylation step involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to C-6 of Man residues of oligomannose N-glycans on lysosomal hydrolases in the cis-Golgi by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (heterodimer of GNPTAB and GNPTG) (Figure 9.4). A phosphodiester N-acetylglucosamindase (NAGPA) in the trans-Golgi removes the GlcNAc to generate Man-6-P recognized by a Man-6-P receptor (M6PR). M6PRs transport lysosomal hydrolases to an acidified compartment which ultimately fuses with the lysosome. The details of this trafficking pathway are presented in Chapter 33. The glycosyltransferases in the ER are mainly multitransmembrane proteins woven into the ER membrane. In contrast, the glycosyltransferases in Golgi compartments are generally type II membrane proteins with a small cytoplasmic amino-terminal domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large lumenal domain that includes an elongated stem region extending from the membrane, and a globular catalytic domain (Chapter 6). The stem region is often cleaved by signal peptide peptidase-like proteases, particularly SPPL-3, releasing the catalytic domain into the lumen of the Golgi and allowing its secretion. Thus, extracellular soluble forms of many glycosyltransferases exist in tissues and sera and may function as transferases if nucleotide sugars are present extracellularly. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm, except for CMP-sialic acids, which are synthesized in the nucleus (Chapter 5). They are subsequently concentrated in the appropriate compartment following transport across the membrane by specialized nucleotide sugar transporters that translocate CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Fuc, and other nucleotide sugars. A few of these transporters can transport more than one nucleotide sugar. Each transporter is a multitransmembrane protein that usually contains 10 membrane-spanning domains. Some CMP-sialic acids can be further modified within the lumen of the Golgi by O-acetyl groups before transfer to a glycan acceptor (Chapter 15). Glycoproteins usually have a range of different N-glycans on a particular Asn-X-Ser/Thr N-glycosylation sequon, leading to glycan heterogeneity at each site. Furthermore, when there is more than one Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon per molecule, different molecules in a population may have different subsets of N-glycans on different sequons, leading to glycoprotein microheterogeneity. Glycoproteins that differ only in their N-glycan complement are termed glycoforms. The variation in N-glycans of a glycoprotein may be due to protein conformation affecting substrate availability for Golgi glycosidases or glycosyltransferases, nucleotide sugar metabolism, transport rate of the glycoprotein through the lumen of the ER and Golgi, and the proximity of an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon to a transmembrane domain. Also, localization of glycosyltransferases within subcompartments of the Golgi can determine which enzymes encounter N-glycan acceptors. It is important to note that glycosylation enzymes often compete for the same acceptor and that most glycosyltransferases and glycosidases require the prior actions of other glycosyltransferases and glycosidases before they can act (Figure 9.4). Determining the functions of N-glycans may be accomplished using inhibitors including tunicamycin, which blocks the first step of N-glycosylation, or castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, deoxymannojirimycin, kifunensine, and swainsonine, which block N-glycan processing; or glycosylation mutants of model organisms such as yeast, cultured mammalian cells, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, and mouse.'
 'Phosphorylation of sugar residues by ATP-dependent kinases occurs at C-2 of O-xylose in proteoglycans (Chapter 17) and at the C-6 position of O-mannose in α-dystroglycan after the mannose has been further glycosylated (Chapter 13). Phosphoglycosylation (or glycophosphorylation), a process in which a sugar phosphoryl is transferred from a nucleotide sugar donor directly to a serine residue on a protein (e.g., GlcNAc-P-serine and Man-P-serine), occurs in Dictyostelium and Leishmania, respectively. In eukaryotic cells, mannose-6-phosphate on the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes occurs by a two-step process involving UDP-GlcNAc as the phosphate donor. In the first step, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase uses UDP-GlcNAc to generate GlcNAcα1-P-6-Manα1-(N-glycan), and in the second step the N-acetylglucosamine moiety is removed by a second enzyme to give P-6-Manα1-(N-glycan) (Chapter 33). Glycan O-acetylation occurs in bacteria and plants and the O-acetylation of sialic acids is found in bacteria, parasites, and vertebrates. The structure of a plant acetyltransferase suggests the use of a catalytic triad and a double-displacement mechanism for acetyl group transfer analogous to esterases and serine proteases. CASD1, the sialate O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) in humans is a multi-spanning membrane protein with a globular extramembranous catalytic domain. The enzyme transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac. As such, it is the sialytransferase-mediated delivery of 9-O-acetylated sialic to acceptor substrates that leads to the 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates observed. 9-O-acetylated sialic acid plays a role in CD22 signaling, a process regulated by the opposing action of a sialate 9-O-acetylesterase (SIAE). It also serves as receptor or coreceptor for influenza C and a number of coronaviruses. N-Deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine residues to glucosamine occurs during heparin/heparan sulfate formation (Chapter 17), lipopolysaccharide assembly (Chapters 21 and 22), and GPI-anchor synthesis (Chapter 12). The bacterial enzyme is zinc-dependent, but in-depth studies of the vertebrate N-deacetylases have not been performed. N-Deacetylation of N-acetylneuraminic acid (the most common sialic acid) has also been reported (Chapter 15). Finally, glycans can be modified in many other ways, including pyruvylation (e.g., in the formation of N-acetylmuramic acid; Chapters 21 and 22), the addition of ethanolamine phosphate (e.g., during GPI-anchor synthesis; Chapter 12), and alkylation, deoxygenation, and halogenation in microbial glycans. All of these reactions are catalyzed by unique transferases or oxidoreductases and represent areas of active research. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from David Vocadlo, Mike Ferguson, Susan Bellis, and Tetsuya Okajima.'
 'A bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary N-glycan is shown in Figure 9.5, and it may be present in all of the more highly branched N-glycans. However, it is not usually extended. Branching and core modification of complex N-glycans. The hybrid and mature, biantennary, complex N-glycans shown in Figure 9.4 may contain more branches because of GlcNAc-transferases in the Golgi that act only after MGAT1 has acted. If the α-mannosidase (more...) Further sugar additions convert the limited repertoire of hybrid and branched N-glycans into an extensive array of mature, complex N-glycans comprising (1) sugar additions to the N-glycan core, (2) elongation of branching GlcNAc residues by sugar additions, and (3) “capping” or “decoration” of elongated branches. The major core modification in vertebrate N-glycans is the addition of α1-6Fuc to the Asn-linked GlcNAc in the N-glycan core (Figure 9.5). The α1-6 fucosyltransferase (FUT8) usually requires the prior action of MGAT1 (Figure 9.4). In invertebrate glycoproteins, both core GlcNAc residues may receive a Fuc in an α1–3 and/or α1-6 linkage (Chapters 25 and 26). In plants, Fuc is transferred to the Asn-linked GlcNAc only in α1-3 linkage (Chapter 24). Also, in plant and helminth glycoproteins, the addition of β1-2Xyl to the β-Man of the core is common. This xylosyltransferase also requires the prior action of MGAT1. Xylose has not been detected in vertebrate N-glycans. The majority of complex and hybrid N-glycans have extended branches that are made by the addition of Gal to the initiating GlcNAc to produce the ubiquitous building block Galβ1-4GlcNAc, referred to as a type-2 N-acetyllactosamine or “LacNAc” sequence (Figure 9.6). The sequential addition of LacNAc disaccharides gives tandem repeats termed poly-LacNAc. In some glycoproteins, β-linked GalNAc is added to GlcNAc instead of Gal, yielding antennae with a GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc) extension (Chapter 14). Typical complex N-glycans found on mature glycoproteins. A LacNAc unit (bracketed) on any branch may be repeated many times.  The most important “capping” reactions involve the addition of Sia, Fuc, Gal, GlcNAc, and sulfate to complex N-glycan branches. Capping sugars are most commonly α-linked and therefore protrude away from the β-linked poly-LacNAc branches, thus facilitating the presentation of terminal sugars to lectins and antibodies. Many of these structures are shared by N- and O-glycans and by glycolipids (Chapter 14). Terminal sialic acids can have further chemical modifications (e.g., O-acetylation) (Chapter 15). The various reactions described above potentially yield a myriad of complex N-glycans that differ in branch number, composition, length, capping arrangements, and core modifications. Some examples to illustrate this diversity are shown in Figure 9.6. Lysosomal hydrolases degrade proteins, lipids, and glycans in the lysosome. Many of these enzymes are targeted to lysosomes by a specialized trafficking pathway that requires phosphorylated oligomannose N-glycans. The phosphorylation step involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to C-6 of Man residues of oligomannose N-glycans on lysosomal hydrolases in the cis-Golgi by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (heterodimer of GNPTAB and GNPTG) (Figure 9.4).'
 'Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety. The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar directly to the polypeptide chain of a protein or glycoprotein recognize their acceptor substrates in a number of different ways. All eukaryotic N-glycans are initiated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), generally an ER-resident multisubunit enzyme that transfers en bloc Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the side chain of asparagine residues in the sequence motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline; Chapter 9). In contrast, the polypeptide GalNAc transferases, responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-glycans, act after the protein has been folded and transported to the Golgi (Chapter 10). The polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases do not recognize a specific sequence motif and in general, they transfer N-acetyllgalactosamine to the side chain hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues found in relatively unstructured regions of the folded protein. Some polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases possess a lectin domain that serves to direct the glycosyltransferase to regions of the polypeptide that already possess O-glycan chains. In this way, regions of polypeptide that have a high degree of O-glycan substitution, typical of mucin structures, can be synthesized. In addition to the O-GalNAc linkage formed by the polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases, a number of other glycosyltransferases can glycosylate the side chain hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine to generate O-GlcNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc, O-Man, and O-Xyl linkages (Chapters 13, 17, and 19). Specificity for a particular serine or threonine residue is achieved in different ways. The xylosyltransferase that O-xylosylates a serine residue in chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, for example, has an absolute requirement for a glycine residue carboxy-terminal to the serine and/or more acidic residues in the vicinity of the glycosylation site. In contrast, the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), responsible for adding N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues on thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (Chapter 19), lacks any obvious consensus sequence associated with acceptor substrate binding specificity. See Table 6.1 for some amino acid–consensus sequences or glycosylation motifs used in the formation of glycopeptide bonds. Amino acid–consensus sequences or glycosylation motifs for the formation of glycopeptide bonds  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident O-fucosyltransferases, POFUT1 and POFUT2, that specifically fucosylate epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), respectively (Chapter 13), differ fundamentally from most other glycosyltransferases. In addition to recognizing a specific sequence motif containing the target serine or threonine residue (Table 6.1), these enzymes only act on EGF-like domains and TSRs that are properly folded and disulfide-bonded. Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates.']","The glycosyltransferases that add N-acetylglucosamine to glycan structures include N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, and the polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases.",N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases attach N-acetylglucosamine to glycan chains,0.5,0.9881585824722636,0.7525360576873574,0.01,0.99999999998,0.5
What are some examples of human fucosyltransferases?,"['In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.'

Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates.'
 ""Paralogs of these enzymes have not been described in the well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but biochemical data suggests that this yeast modifies intracellular proteins with mannose (Man) and even di- and tri-Man. Furthermore, several reports suggest that select intracellular proteins of mammalian cells are modified by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). The significance of these intriguing latter examples awaits identification of the responsible glycosyltransferases and evidence for their roles in cells. Examples in which the glycosyltransferases are known are represented schematically in Figure 18.1A and summarized in Table 18.1. Cellular topography of nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation. (A) Monoglycosylation (m) in the cytoplasm (e.g., O-GlcNAc and O-Fuc). (B) Complex (c) glycosylation in the cytoplasm by O-GlcNAc transferases (GTs) that extend the first sugar. (C) Cytoplasmic monoglycosylation (more...) Examples of nuclear or cytoplasmic glycosylation events  Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent. An example of bacterial monoglycosylation that leads to a known function comes from the EF-P protein, the bacterial homolog of eukaryotic elongation initiation factor 5a. In some bacteria, EF-P suppresses translational stalling by a mechanism that involves oxidation of a critical lysyl residue, and its eukaryotic ortholog is regulated by hypusylation. A recent phylogenetic analysis of EF-P sequences revealed a subset of enzymes with an Arg in place of Lys, and a coevolving gene that was subsequently identified by biochemistry and mass spectrometry as an argininyl rhamnosyltransferase. Assembly of the Rha-Arg linkage activates EF-P and is required for pathogenicity of Pseudomonas, a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen, and a number of other bacteria. The discovery of this linkage by a phylogenetic approach suggests that more noncanonical examples of glycosylation are yet to be discovered. A directed proteomics search for glycoproteins in the Gram-positive intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, biased only because potential glycopeptides were affinity enriched with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), identified several glycoproteins with cytoplasmic localization and functions: the molecular chaperone DnaK, the PdhC E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the DNA translocase FtsK1, the signal recognition particle receptor FtsY, FtsZ involved in cell division, and others of unknown function. Peptides from these proteins were modified with single HexNAc residues attached to Ser residues. Some of the sites were variably modified, hinting at a novel regulatory process, but nothing is known about the mechanism of this glycosylation. Pathogenic bacteria have developed a wide array of toxin and effector virulence factors that also monoglycosylate host-cell proteins (Figure 18.1C). By virtue of their glycosyltransferase domains, these impair the host's cytoplasmic or nuclear machinery and disrupt host-cell immune response. For example, small cytoplasmic G-proteins (GTP-binding proteins) of the Rho family are involved in regulating the cytoskeleton. Certain toxins from anaerobic bacteria were found to contain retaining glycosyltransferase activities that inhibit G-proteins by attaching a glycosyl moiety to a threonine residue (Thr-37) in their GTP-binding sites. These secreted toxins show the remarkable ability of translocating across the surface membrane into the cytoplasm of mammalian target cells. The enterotoxins from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) and Clostridium sordellii are α-glucosyltransferases from CAZy family GT44 that use UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) as the donor. In contrast, a similar toxin from Clostridium novyi is an O-αGlcNAc transferase that uses UDP-GlcNAc as the donor.""
 'Recently, a second β-linked O-glucose modification site has been identified between the third and the fourth Cys of the EGF repeats at the putative consensus sequence C3XNTXGSFXC4 (Figure 13.1A), which is found in more than 30 proteins in mouse and human databases. Homologs of POGLUT1, termed POGLUT2 and POGLUT3, are responsible for modifying this site. The O-glucose at this site has not been reported to be elongated past the monosaccharide. Although β-linked O-GlcNAc is very common on proteins in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments (Chapter 19), the same modification can be found in comparatively few membrane and secreted proteins. Addition of O-GlcNAc occurs between the fifth and sixth conserved Cys of an EGF repeat at the putative consensus C5XXXX(S/T)GX2-3C6 (Figure 13.1A) in mouse and Drosophila Notch. However, sites have been mapped on only a few proteins. The O-GlcNAc can be elongated by β1,4Gal followed by a sialic acid to form Siaα2-3/6Galβ1-4GlcNAc. The EGF-specific O-GlcNAc transferase, EOGT, is distinct from OGT, the GlcNAc-transferase that modifies nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (Chapter 19). Inactivation of Drosophila Eogt is pupal lethal and causes a wing-blistering defect if deleted in the wing. The Drosophila phenotype can be explained by an EOGT substrate Dumpy and no obvious Notch-deficient phenotypes have been observed. However, genetic interactions between eogt and Notch pathway gene mutations occur in the fly and mutations in human EOGT result in skin and skeletal problems in AOS (Adams–Oliver syndrome type 4; OMIM 615297), a disorder with links to the Notch pathway. Consistently, EOGT in mice regulates vascular development and integrity by potentiating Delta-like ligand-mediated Notch signaling. O-Fucose is also found on TSRs. Similar to EGF repeats, TSRs are small protein domains (50–60 amino acids) with six conserved Cys that form three disulfide bonds (Figure 13.4). Like EGF repeats, TSRs are found in a subset of cell-surface and secreted proteins in metazoans, and they appear to function in protein–protein interactions. The O-fucose site occurs between the first and second conserved Cys residues at the putative consensus sequence C1X2(S/T)C2 in TSRs in about 50 proteins (Table 13.1). The O-fucose on TSRs can be elongated to form the disaccharide Glcβ1-3Fucα-O-Ser/Thr, first observed in 1975 in glycosides from human urine. The enzyme that fucosylates TSRs is POFUT2. It is expressed in many cells and tissues and is distinct from POFUT1. Elimination of Pofut2 in mice results in early embryonic lethality with defects in gastrulation. The gene encoding the β3-glucosyltransferase that elongates O-fucose on TSRs is B3GLCT. Mutations in B3GLCT in humans result in a multifaceted severe developmental disorder known as Peters-plus syndrome (OMIM 261540). Elimination of B3glct in mice phenocopies many of the defects seen in Peters-plus syndrome. TSRs are also often frequently modified with C-mannose (Figure 13.4), although the relationship between the two modifications is not yet clear. A number of biologically interesting proteins are known or predicted to contain this modification, including thrombospondin-1 and -2, all ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; ADAMTS 1–20) and ADAMTS-like proteins, properdin, and F-spondin (Table 13.1).']","Examples of human fucosyltransferases include fucosyltransferases III-VII, which attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans. Additionally, human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage.","The following enzymes are human glycosyltransferase genes: FUT1, FUT2, FUT3, FUT4, FUT5, FUT6, FUT7, FUT8, FUT9, FUT10, FUT11",1.0,0.9940164108947542,0.6250251976672916,0.019417475728155338,0.94999999997625,1.0
What are some examples of human galactosyltransferases?,"['Interestingly, in individuals that are “nonsecretors” and Lewis-negative, fucosylated glycans are not present beyond 2′-fucosyllactose, and the overall repertoire of oligosaccharides is reduced. Most other mammals synthesize lactose but also express species-specific repertoires of glycans that largely differ from humans—often being much simpler—but may have similar functions. Beside lactose, which is nutritionally important, the larger human milk oligosaccharides are thought to be important in infant immunoprotection and to have prebiotic activity by contributing to the development of healthy microbiota. Surprisingly, there is essentially no information on the hormone-regulated biosynthesis of these abundant glycans. Lactose is generated by a β1-4 galactosyltransferase (termed lactose synthase) only in the lactating mammary gland, because of the lactation-specific expression of the modifier protein α-lactalbumin, which causes the enzyme to transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to Glc rather than to GlcNAc. Even though this process has been demonstrated to occur in intact Golgi, the precise mechanisms of how lactose is modified by addition of other sugars by specific glycosyltransferases during lactation are unknown. It is assumed that the same enzymes involved in making termini of other glycan classes are responsible. The Galα1-3Gal epitope (often called “alpha-Gal”) is synthesized on Type-2 units on glycolipids and glycoproteins by a specific α1-3GalT (Figure 14.8). This epitope and the α1-3GalT that synthesizes it are expressed by New World primates and many nonprimate mammals, but the α1-3GalT gene (GGTA1) is inactivated in humans and Old World primates. Mice engineered to lack the α1-3GalT develop cataracts. Species that do not express the Galα1-3Gal epitope, including humans, carry anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies, likely because of immunization through exposure to the Galα1-3Gal epitope on microbes and food. Anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies present a major barrier to the use of porcine and other nonprimate organs for xenotransplantation in humans, because they bind to Galα1-3Gal epitopes on the vascular endothelium of xenotransplants and cause hyperacute graft rejection through complement-mediated endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Efforts are in progress to overcome this barrier by using animal organ donors that have been genetically modified. Approaches include transgenic expression of enzymes, such as FUT1, that diminishes Galα1-3Gal expression by diverting Type-2 units toward H antigen synthesis. Unfortunately, pig tissues lacking Galα1-3Gal elicit a graft rejection reaction to other pig antigens. Anti-Galα1-3Gal antibodies have also been shown to significantly diminish the infective efficiency of recombinant retroviruses. The problem has been solved through the generation of packaging cell lines that are deficient in α1-3GalT. Allergic reactions toward therapeutic monoclonal antibodies expressing Galα1-3Gal first illustrated the importance of preparing recombinant glycoproteins for therapeutic use in humans in cells that do not express α1-3GalT. Severe allergies to red meat consumption can occur when high titer IgE antibodies against this epitope appear in adult humans, claimed to be the consequence of a prior bite by the Lone Star tick, which may be expressing the same epitope in its saliva. Structure and synthesis of the Galα1-3Gal antigen. The α1-3GalT uses unsubstituted Type-2 units on glycoproteins or glycolipids (R) to form the Galα1-3Gal terminal epitope. The glycolipid globoside serves as the substrate for the (more...) The Forssman antigen (also known as globopentosylceramide) is a glycolipid that contains terminal α1-3GalNAc linked to the terminal GalNAc of globoside transferred by the α1-3 GalNAcT GBGT1, which is related in sequence to ABO transferases (Figure 14.8).'
 'In addition, glycans can be modified by many other enzyme types, including sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, O-acetyltransferases, O-methyltransferases, pyruvyltransferases, and phosphoethanolamine transferases. Most glycosyltransferases show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates, and this led Saul Roseman and coworkers to advance the “one enzyme–one linkage” hypothesis. The human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase exemplifies this concept. This enzyme catalyzes a glycosylation reaction in which galactose is added in α-linkage to the C-3 hydroxyl group of a galactose residue on the acceptor substrate (Figure 6.1). However, the enzyme only acts on galactose modified by fucose in α1-2-linkage and prior modification by other monosaccharides, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid, yields a glycan that is not a substrate (Figure 6.1). The strict acceptor substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases is illustrated by the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase. The B transferase adds galactose in α1-3-linkage to the H antigen (top middle) to form the B antigen (more...) We now know that there are instances in which more than one glycosyltransferase can use the same acceptor to make the same linkage. The human fucosyltransferases III–VII, for example, all attach fucose in α1-3-linkage to N-acetyllactosamine moieties on glycans (Chapter 14). Examples of relaxed acceptor specificity are provided by the α2-3 sialyltransferases and β1-4 galactosyltransferases that act broadly on β-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. In some rare cases, a single enzyme can catalyze more than one reaction. Human fucosyltransferase III can attach fucose in either α1-3- or α1-4-linkage, and an enzyme called EXTL2 can attach either N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in α-linkage to glucuronic acid (Chapter 17). The β1-4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation shows an unusual flexibility in specificity. When β1-4 galactosyltransferase binds α-lactalbumin (the complex is called lactose synthase), it switches its acceptor specificity from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose, which enables the synthesis of lactose and other oligosaccharides during milk production (Chapter 14). Finally, some glycosyltransferases have two separate active sites with different substrate specificities. For example, the enzymes that synthesize the backbones of heparan sulfate (EXT1) and hyaluronan (HAS) have one active site that catalyzes the attachment of N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid and another that attaches glucuronic acid to N-acetylglucosamine (Chapters 16 and 17). However, the examples described above are all exceptions to the generally strict donor, acceptor, and linkage specificity shown by most glycosyltransferases, a property that serves to define and limit the number and type of glycan structures observed in a given cell type or organism. The glycosyltransferases that transfer monosaccharides or oligosaccharides directly to polypeptide or lipid moieties also show a high degree of substrate specificity and this will be discussed in more detail below for those involving polypeptide. Glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of glycosphingolipids transfer a monosaccharide moiety to what was originally a serine residue in the ceramide lipid precursor of sphingolipids (see Chapter 11). Because different glycolipids have different ceramide moieties, it appears that some glycosyltransferases, such as the sialyltransferases, differentially recognize their substrates based on the nature of the ceramide moiety.'
 'Glycosyltransferases that add O-Glc and O-GlcNAc to other serine and threonine residues in the EGF-like domain also exist and these enzymes also recognize a specific sequence motif and require a folded EGF-like domain. A number of the glycan-elongating glycosyltransferases that act on glycoproteins also recognize the polypeptide moiety of their acceptor substrates. The glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (a member of the family of β1-4GalNAcTs) provides an interesting example in which modification of an N-glycan is dependent on the presence of the protein sequence motif Pro-X-Arg/Lys positioned several amino acids amino-terminally to the N-glycan being modified. The motif is typically followed closely by additional positively charged residues. The X-ray crystal structure of its acceptor substrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, shows that the Pro-X-Arg/Lys motif is at the beginning of a short surface-exposed helix that also contains the additional positively charged residues (Figure 6.2). The N-acetylgalactosamine residue transferred by this enzyme subsequently undergoes a biologically important 4-O-sulfation reaction that, in the case of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, generates a determinant recognized by specific liver clearance receptors that remove them from the blood (Chapter 34). Glycosyltransferases that only elongate the fucose moiety added by POFUT1 or POFUT2 also exist (Chapter 13). The specificity shown by these enzymes stems from their ability to recognize both the fucose moiety and the EGF-like and TSR components of their acceptor substrates. Additional examples of enzymes that elongate glycans on specific glycoprotein substrates include the polysialyltransferases that act on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and neuropilin-2 (Chapter 15), and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EXTL3, that adds N-acetylglucosamine in α1-4-linkage to glucuronic acid in the first committed step to heparan sulfate biosynthesis on proteoglycans (Chapter 17). Human chorionic gonadotropin showing the determinants of recognition used by glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyl (GalNAc) transferase. Ribbon diagram of a fragment (residues 34–58) of human chorionic gonadotropin (PDB [protein data bank] (more...) In a variation on this theme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase selectively modifies the N-glycans found on a large family of lysosomal enzymes that differ in three-dimensional structure and that lack any obvious and common protein sequence motif. In this case, modification by this enzyme has been shown to be dependent on lysine residues appropriately spaced and positioned relative to the N-glycan site (Chapter 33). The ER-resident glucosyltransferase, UGGT, is also able to transfer sugar to the N-glycans on a large but unique subset of glycoprotein substrates (Chapter 39). In this case, the enzyme adds a glucose moiety to the N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins rendering them substrates for the ER-resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin. These lectins in turn recruit folding catalysts that promote correct disulfide bond formation and the cis–trans isomerization of proline residues. Approximately 1% of genes in the mammalian genome are involved in the production or modification of glycans. More than 750,000 glycosyltransferase sequences are known across all kingdoms, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Based on sequence analysis, they have been categorized into more than 110 glycosyltransferase families as described in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 8). Although the absence of significant sequence similarity between members of one family and another constitutes the basis for this classification, short sequence motifs common to the members of more than one family have been identified.'
 ""Paralogs of these enzymes have not been described in the well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but biochemical data suggests that this yeast modifies intracellular proteins with mannose (Man) and even di- and tri-Man.

Examples of nuclear or cytoplasmic glycosylation events  Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent.

In some bacteria, EF-P suppresses translational stalling by a mechanism that involves oxidation of a critical lysyl residue, and its eukaryotic ortholog is regulated by hypusylation. A recent phylogenetic analysis of EF-P sequences revealed a subset of enzymes with an Arg in place of Lys, and a coevolving gene that was subsequently identified by biochemistry and mass spectrometry as an argininyl rhamnosyltransferase. Assembly of the Rha-Arg linkage activates EF-P and is required for pathogenicity of Pseudomonas, a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen, and a number of other bacteria.

A directed proteomics search for glycoproteins in the Gram-positive intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, biased only because potential glycopeptides were affinity enriched with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), identified several glycoproteins with cytoplasmic localization and functions: the molecular chaperone DnaK, the PdhC E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the DNA translocase FtsK1, the signal recognition particle receptor FtsY, FtsZ involved in cell division, and others of unknown function. Peptides from these proteins were modified with single HexNAc residues attached to Ser residues. Some of the sites were variably modified, hinting at a novel regulatory process, but nothing is known about the mechanism of this glycosylation. Pathogenic bacteria have developed a wide array of toxin and effector virulence factors that also monoglycosylate host-cell proteins (Figure 18.1C). By virtue of their glycosyltransferase domains, these impair the host's cytoplasmic or nuclear machinery and disrupt host-cell immune response. For example, small cytoplasmic G-proteins (GTP-binding proteins) of the Rho family are involved in regulating the cytoskeleton. Certain toxins from anaerobic bacteria were found to contain retaining glycosyltransferase activities that inhibit G-proteins by attaching a glycosyl moiety to a threonine residue (Thr-37) in their GTP-binding sites. These secreted toxins show the remarkable ability of translocating across the surface membrane into the cytoplasm of mammalian target cells. The enterotoxins from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) and Clostridium sordellii are α-glucosyltransferases from CAZy family GT44 that use UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) as the donor. In contrast, a similar toxin from Clostridium novyi is an O-αGlcNAc transferase that uses UDP-GlcNAc as the donor.""
 'Each branch is a committed pathway, because sialyltransferases cannot directly convert a-series gangliosides (beyond GM3) to their corresponding b-series gangliosides. Because of this branch exclusivity, competition between two enzymes at a key branch point determines the relative expression levels of the final GSL products. The transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to a-, b-, and c-series gangliosides, transforming GM3 into GM2, GD3 into GD2, or GT3 into GT2, is catalyzed by the same N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. Likewise, the transfer of galactose to GM2 to form GM1, to GD2 to form GD1b, or to GT2 to form GT1c is accomplished by a single galactosyltransferase. In addition, the levels of nucleotide sugar donors used by glycosyltransferases in the Golgi lumen (including UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, and CMP-Neu5Ac) ultimately affect the final structure of glycans and are regulated by synthetic enzymes in the cytoplasm or nucleus and by the activity of nucleotide sugar transporters in the Golgi membrane (Chapter 5). The sialic acids of human gangliosides are exclusively in the form of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its O-acetylated derivatives, but those of many other mammals contain both Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (Chapter 15). Even in animals with predominantly Neu5Gc in the gangliosides of nonneural tissues, their brain gangliosides have nearly exclusively Neu5Ac. Sialic acids on gangliosides may be further modified by O-acetylation or removal of the N-acyl group, to generate a free amino group (Chapter 15). An additional level of regulation occurs via stable association of different GSL glycosyltransferases into “multiglycosyltransferase” complexes. The multiple enzymes are thought to act concertedly on the growing GSL without releasing intermediate structures, ensuring progression to the preferred end product. Although the enzymes that catalyze the initial steps in GSL biosynthesis are specific and used only for GSL biosynthesis, outer sugars, such as the outermost sialic acid, fucose, or glucuronic acid residues, are sometimes added by glycosyltransferases that also act on glycoproteins, resulting in terminal structures being shared by GSL and glycoprotein glycans (Chapter 14). One example is the blood group ABO antigen system. The α1-3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase encoded by the blood group A gene produces the blood group A determinant GalNAcα1-3(Fucα1-2)Galβ on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Correspondingly, the α1-3 galactosyltransferase encoded by the allelic blood group B gene transfers galactose to both glycoproteins and glycolipids. Major brain ganglioside structures are highly conserved among all mammals and birds. In contrast, differences in blood cell glycolipids are well known even among humans, as in the case of the ABO, Lewis, and P blood group antigens (Chapter 14). Species differences among glycolipids also occur, one example being the expression of Forssman antigen, GalNAcα1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcβCer. This molecule is a good immunogen in Forssman antigen–negative species, such as rabbit, rat, and human, which have a mutated α1-3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that cannot transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to the precursor Gb4Cer. In contrast, guinea pig, mouse, sheep, and goat are Forssman antigen–positive. The breakdown of GSLs occurs stepwise by the action of lysosomal hydrolases. GSLs on the outer surface of the plasma membrane are internalized, along with other membrane components, in invaginated vesicles that then fuse with endosomes, resulting in the GSL glycan facing the endosome lumen.']",Examples of human galactosyltransferases include the human B blood group α1-3 galactosyltransferase and the galactosyltransferase involved in N-acetyllactosamine formation.,"The following enzymes are human galactosyltransferase genes: B3GALT1, B3GALT2, B3GALT5, COLGALT1, B4GALT7, B3GALT6, COLGALT2, A4GALT, A14GALT, A4GALT1, B3GALT9, B3GNT10",0.5,0.9374088239340951,0.7467047033763942,0.019230769230769232,0.99999999998,0.0
What factors contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species?,"['Last but not least, innate immune mechanisms are kept in check in vivo via recognition of self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs). Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses. Perhaps not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved this state of molecular mimicry by making use of “every possible trick in the book,” including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer. In some instances, the impact of the pathogen is aggravated by autoimmune reactions, resulting from host reactions to these self-like antigens. Pathogens and parasites also engage in glycogimmickry—to cite just a few examples, the gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis induces tolerogenic states of gut immunity using a pentasaccharide called polysaccharide A, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) binding to host dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbingcnonintegrin (DC-SIGN) induces expression of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10, and helminthic parasites have evolved many ways to modulate the immune response of their hosts toward prolonged tolerance, using specific immunomodulatory glycans. Secreted and soluble milk oligosaccharides (all extensions of the disaccharide lactose) of mammals provide an example of trans-generational glycan manipulation of microbial symbionts or pathogens in the infant by maternal glycans. These glycans have potent effects by favoring symbionts and blocking pathogenic microbes (bacteria and viruses) of the infant gut. Expression of certain glycans on different glycoconjugates in different tissues at different stages of development implies diverse roles for these glycan structures within the same organism. For example, Man-6-P-containing glycans were first found on lysosomal enzymes and are involved in lysosomal trafficking (Chapter 33). However, such glycans are now known to occur on some apparently unrelated proteins, for different functional roles. Likewise, the sialylated fucosylated lactosamines critical for selectin recognition (Chapter 34) are found in a variety of unrelated cell types in mammals, and the polySia chains that play an important part in embryonic nervous system neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) function (Chapter 15) are also found on a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) (CCR7) expressed in dendritic cells, where they appear to be important for targeting of these cells to the lymph nodes. Given that glycans are added posttranslationally, these observations should not be surprising. Once a new glycan or modification has been expressed in an organism, several distinct functions could evolve independently in different tissues and at different times in development. If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species. Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20).'
 'Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species. Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20). Given all of the above, it is challenging to predict which glycan structures are likely to mediate the more specific or crucial biological roles within an organism. As mentioned above, terminal sugar sequences, unusual structures, or modifications of glycans are more likely to be involved in such specific roles. The predictive value of this observation is reduced by the fact that such entities are also more likely to be involved in interactions with microorganisms and other potentially noxious agents. Further complexity arises from “microheterogeneity” in glycan structure (Chapter 20), wherein the same glycosylation site on the same protein in the same species can carry a variety of related glycan structures or none at all. The challenge then is to predict and sort out which distinct roles can be assigned to a given glycan structure in a given cell type and organism. In the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and hosts, pathogens will tend to exploit glycans that are difficult for the host to change (those constrained by their intrinsic host function), and because hosts are unable to alter their glycans easily owing to their slower evolutionary rates and functional constraints of existing glycans, the extrinsic and intrinsic functions of these glycans are bound to overlap. Hosts can, however, to the degree possible, be expected to evolve glycans that are difficult for microbes to mimic, such as the vertebrate-specific sialic acid Neu5Gc (Chapter 15) and sulfated GAGs, prokaryotes do not seem to have reinvented (Chapter 17). Because microorganisms and parasites that bind glycans evolve in parallel with their multicellular hosts, they must adapt their glycan-binding “repertoire” to any change in glycan structure presented by the host. At the same time, each of these microorganisms is itself host to its own suite of parasites (phages), known to exploit the cell surface glycans of microbes in order to infect these. Host populations (multicellular organisms infected by microbes or microbes infected by phages) may evolve new modifications of the structures targeted by their parasites, especially if the latter had meanwhile evolved a vital function elsewhere within the organism. This would constrain the preservation of the underlying scaffolding on which the latest modification was placed, while adding yet another layer of complexity to host glycans. Such cycles of evolutionary interaction between (nested sets of) microbes and hosts might explain some of the complex and extended sugar chains found in multicellular organisms, especially in areas of frequent microbial contact, such as in secreted mucins on mucosal surfaces. In this manner, “junk” glycans (i.e., glycans without current adaptive value) could accumulate, akin to “junk” DNA. An important distinction is that much of the junk DNA consists of selfish DNA elements capable of replicating, whereas glycans cannot encode additional copies of themselves, given that their synthesis relies on the activity of a coordinated network of gene products. Although such structures may still function as structural scaffolding, they may have no other specific role in a particular cell type at that particular time in evolution. They would, of course, provide fodder for future evolutionary selection, either for new organism-intrinsic functions or selective responses to a new pathogen. Additionally, neutral drift (which is now acknowledged as a major process in evolution) may explain some of the apparent “junk” glycans. The microheterogeneity inherent in glycan synthesis processes may be producing “neutral noise,” but this noise may also contribute to evolutionary flexibility. Some functions of glycans are discovered serendipitously. In other instances, the investigator who has elucidated complete details of the structure and biosynthesis of a specific glycan is left without knowing its functions. It is necessary to design experiments that can differentiate between trivial and crucial functions mediated by each glycan. Various approaches are discussed below, emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach (also presented in schematic form in Figure 7.2).'
 'However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity. A few examples include Escherichia coli K1 and Meningococcus group B (polysialic acid), E. coli K5 (heparosan, heparan sulfate backbone), Group A Streptococcus (hyaluronan), Group B Streptococcus (sialylated N-acetyllactosamines), and Campylobacter jejuni (ganglioside-like glycans). Initially, it was thought that the responsible microbial genes arose via lateral gene transfer from eukaryotes. However, in all instances in which genetic information is available, evidence points toward convergent evolution rather than gene transfer. For example, genes synthesizing sialic acids in bacteria seem to have been derived from preexisting prokaryotic pathways for nonulosonic acids, an ancestral family of monosaccharides with a structural resemblance. In contrast, bacterial sialyltransferases bear little resemblance to those of eukaryotes, and the vast sequence differences between different bacterial sialyltransferases indicate that these have even been reinvented on several separate occasions. Of course, lateral gene transfer is common among Bacteria and Archaea, facilitating rapid phylogenetic dissemination of such enzymatic “inventions.” Why do closely related species differ with regard to the presence or absence of certain glycans? Does the same glycoprotein have the same type of glycosylation in distinct but related species? Relatively little data exist regarding these issues, but examples of both, extreme conservation and diversification are found. A reasonable explanation is that conservation of glycan structure reflects specific functional constraints for the glycans in question. In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral). Even in the absence of important endogenous functions, glycans can have key roles in mediating interactions with symbionts and pathogens. The evolution of diversity and microheterogeneity (across tissues and cell types) in glycosylation could well be of value to the organisms in providing additional obstacles to pathogens that use host glycans for attachment and entry. Free glycans (e.g., milk oligosaccharides) can also have important roles in attracting and feeding symbiont microbial communities needed for internal functions (e.g., immune maturation) and in accommodating or restricting these to particular areas of the host. There can even be significant variation in glycosylation among members of the same species, particularly in terminal glycan sequences. The classic example is the ABH(O) histo-blood group system (Chapter 14), a polymorphism found in all human populations, which has also persisted for tens of millions of years of primate evolution and has even been independently rederived in some instances. Despite its clinical importance for blood transfusion, this polymorphism appears to cause no major differences in the intrinsic biology of individuals of the species (Chapter 14) beyond conferring a variable susceptibility to viruses, such as noroviruses, that use ABO glycans as receptors. Like other blood groups, the ABO polymorphism is accompanied by production of natural antibodies against the variants absent from an individual. These antibodies may be protective by causing complement-mediated lysis of enveloped viruses generated within other individuals who express the target structure. Thus, an enveloped virus generated in a B blood group individual might be susceptible to complement-mediated lysis on contact with an A or O blood group individual who has circulating anti-B antibodies. The glycosyltransferase gene ABO responsible for synthesizing ABO antigens is one of the few loci in the human genome shown to be under balancing (frequency-dependent) selection. This latter mechanism may also provide an explanation for interspecies diversity via selection exerted by pathogens recognizing glycans as targets for attachment and entry into cells.'
 'However, the late Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner suggested there is now enough information about humans to consider ourselves to be the “next model organism.” Indeed, the studies that combine tractable questions about the pathobiology of naturally occurring mutations affecting glycans in humans with mechanistic studies in suitable model organisms tend to provide deeper insights into glycan functions. It was once popular to suggest that every glycan on every cell type must have a critical intrinsic host function. Analysis of data on glycosyltransferase-deficient mice suggests that this is not the case. For example, ST6Gal-I α2-6 sialyltransferase is the main enzyme that produces Siaα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1- termini on vertebrate glycans. Although this glycan serves as a specific ligand for the B-cell regulatory molecule CD22 (Siglec-2; Chapter 35), it is also found on many other cell types, as well as on many soluble secreted glycoproteins. Furthermore, ST6Gal-I mRNA varies markedly among cell types, and ST6Gal-I transcription is regulated by several cell type–specific promoters, which are in turn modulated by hormones and cytokines. Despite these data, the prominent consequences of eliminating its expression in mice so far seem to be restricted to the immune and hematopoietic systems and some cell adhesion, apoptosis, and oncogenic pathways. If the specific intrinsic functions of the ST6Gal-I glycan product are in fact restricted to some systems, why is it expressed in so many other locations? And why up-regulate its expression so markedly in the liver and endothelium during a so-called “acute phase” inflammatory response? Besides feedback on the immune system, could it be that scattered expression of this structure in other locations functions as a “smoke screen” or temporary “firewall,” restricting intra-organismal spread of an invading pathogen? Could it also be that heavily glycosylated nonnucleated cells like mammalian erythrocytes act as “decoy traps” for viral pathogens that require nucleated cells for replication? Answers to these questions must take into account the evolutionary selection pressures (both intrinsic and extrinsic recognition phenomena such as host–pathogen interactions and innate immune contributions) on glycosyltransferase products. Many effects may also not be apparent in inbred genetically modified mice living in hygienic vivaria, requiring studies in a natural, pathogen-rich environment. It is also possible that other gene products are masking phenotypes in these model systems, compensating for the loss. Furthermore, it is likely we have not looked hard enough at such genetically modified mice nor applied the relevant environmental pressures to elicit phenotypes. Based on available data, it is reasonable to suggest that the evolution of glycan diversification in complex multicellular organisms has been driven by selection pressures of both intrinsic and extrinsic origin relative to the organism under study (Chapter 7). Glycans are particularly susceptible to the “Red Queen” effect, in which host glycans must keep changing to stay ahead of the pathogens, which have more rapid evolutionary rates because of their short generation times, high mutation rates, and rampant horizontal gene transfer. Glycan evolution is expected to be under selective constraints—that is, opposing selective forces influencing their course of evolution. Given their important role in definition of the molecular frontier of cells and organisms, the same glycan can come under opposing selective pressures at different times in the life of a cell or organism. Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens.'
 'Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution. Viruses typically have minimalist genomes and use host-cell machinery for replication. Thus, glycosylation of enveloped viruses reflects that of the host. However, there are exceptions. Giant viruses such as the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough that they can express their own glycosylation machineries. On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors. For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide. In this regard, it has been suggested that the high frequency of heterozygous states for human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 44) may reflect selection for genomes that limit glycosylation of invading viruses. Host lectins may also be “hijacked” by glycans on viral surface glycoproteins. For example, Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1; Chapter 15) is used by the heavily sialylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to gain entry into macrophages. Viral protein sequence can also influence host glycosylation (e.g., by structural constraints on access for glycosyltransferases or hydrolases), in a manner that favors viral antigenicity, such as the high-mannose N-glycans on HIV-1 envelope gp120 trimers. Despite the enormous potential for structural diversity, a rather limited subset of all possible monosaccharides and their possible linkages and modifications are found in eukaryotic cells. Why one encounters only such a limited subset of the possible glycan structures is a puzzling question. Could there be trade-offs between the variety of glycan structures and the additional resources, such as energy and biosynthetic pathways, that cells/organisms need in order to maintain that variety? Or maybe the variety of structures is limited by a combination of positive and negative selection due to both, its intrinsic functions and interactions with symbionts and pathogens? Regardless, this limited subset has allowed better elucidation of structures of eukaryotic glycans. In contrast, Bacteria and Archaea have had several billion additional years to respond to selective pressure from pathogens; in particular, phages. These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow. Glycosylation in Bacteria and Archaea is far more diverse, both in terms of the range of monosaccharides used or synthesized, and in the types of linkages and modifications (Chapters 21 and 22). In addition, prokaryotic cell–cell interactions both within and between species are often mediated by glycans. However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity.']","Conservation of glycan structure in distinct but related species can reflect specific functional constraints for the glycans.

Additionally, selection pressures from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as host-pathogen interactions and innate immune contributions, play a role in shaping the evolution of glycan diversity across species. The need for host glycans to continually change to stay ahead of rapidly evolving pathogens also influences the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species.","There is too little information available today to allow a comprehensive exposition of the evolution of even the major classes of glycans. However, based on available data, it is reasonable to suggest that selective pressures largely come from either intrinsic or extrinsic factors related to organism-specific functions of glycans and competitive host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Host glycans must evolve rapidly to compete with pathogens that have short generation times, high mutation rates, and horizontal gene transfer, yet glycans with a critical intrinsic role may incur deleterious effects if eliminated or mutated.",0.8333333333333334,0.7654929619789802,0.7602446861942668,0.024193548387096774,0.99999999998,0.6666666666666666
What is the significance of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains?,"['The β-trefoil fold structure, characteristic of the R-type lectin superfamily, is evidently a core framework in living systems that arose via bricolage and has evolved to play key roles in a variety of biochemical processes, including carbohydrate binding. Discovery of new R-type lectins is ongoing. The ancestor of this superfamily is not yet clear, but it is found in members of all biological domains. The origins and evolution of these lectins are therefore of interest to scientists in many fields. The presence of β-trefoil folding in proteins may reflect either convergent or divergent evolution. Elucidating the physiological functions of various R-type lectins will require identification of their endogenous ligands and the specific environmental stimuli that trigger their expression. Increasing knowledge of R-type lectin structure and function will enhance our understanding of lectin-glycan interactions in living systems and facilitate biotechnological applications of these lectins.

 ""In the ER, A and B chains separate following reduction of the disulfide bond, perhaps catalyzed by the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase. A portion of the free A chain, which may be partially denatured in the ER, escapes by retrotranslocation through the Sec61 translocon and enters the cytoplasm. Pathway of ricin uptake by cells and mechanism whereby toxic activity of A chain in cytoplasm results in cell death.  Just a few molecules of ricin A-chain in the cytoplasm are sufficient to kill cells. The catalytic subunit of A-chain is an rRNA N-glycosylase having eight α-helices and eight β-strands, which cleaves one purine base (adenine 4324) in the exposed GAGA tetraloop of the 28S RNA of the eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunit. This deletion results in loss of binding of elongation factor-2, inability of ribosomes to perform protein synthesis, and consequent cell death. Sequence analysis of RCA-I and RCA-II revealed that their B-chains contain two similar, characteristic regions in the polypeptide (i.e., the tandem-repeat R-type lectin). Each of the domains is approximately 120 aa long, with three tandem repeats of a 40-residue subdomain. Each subdomain contains a Q-x-W motif (x represents any aa). This tandem repeat is present in other toxins from plants of various phyla and is evidently characteristic of plant lectins. In the late 1990s, similar sequences were discovered in lectins from nonplant organisms, indicating that the ricin-B-like pattern is universal. In the early 2000s, these lectins were classified as the “R-type lectin superfamily,” and this superfamily is now categorized as a single domain (Pfam: PF14200) or tandem-repeat domain (Pfam: PF00652). Crystal structure analysis of ricin (Figure 31.2) indicated that B-chain (PDB 2AAI) has a barbell-like shape with the two tandem R-type CRDs at the ends, ∼35 Å apart. R-type lectins have a fold termed “β-trefoil fold” (from the Latin “trifolium” meaning “three-leaved,” as seen for example in clover) (Figure 31.4). The β-trefoil fold presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding the 40-residue subdomain. The three subdomains, termed α, β, and γ, each consist of 12 β-strands and loops arranged around a central axis, giving the protein internal pseudorotation symmetry. β-trefoil fold is maintained by the characteristic Q-x-W motif in each subdomain of ricin B-chain and common R-type lectins. More than 10% of lectins use this fold for glycan recognition (Chapter 30). Structures of β-trefoil folds of R-type lectin domains in various proteins. (Top) Structures derived from bacteria, fungi, and slime molds: AH (actinohivin in actinobacteria; PDB 4DEN), CNL (nematocidal lectin from conifer-loving mushroom Clitocybe (more...) In view of the conserved structures consisting of variable loops and a short β-barrel, in combination with low sequence homology based on β-strands connected by loops, the ability of β-trefoil proteins to flexibly select a variety of carbohydrate partners is not surprising. β-Trefoil proteins have been divided into several groups on the basis of biological function; these include lectins, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (PDB 2AXM; Chapter 38), interleukin-1 (PDB 1ILT), Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (PDB 4IHZ), and the actin cross-linking protein hisactophilin (PDB 1HCE), although they have no Q-x-W motif. Each subdomain could conceivably have a carbohydrate-binding site; however, in most R-type lectins only one or two subdomains bind a carbohydrate ligand. Carbohydrate-binding of RCA-I and RCA-II arises from aromatic amino acids stacking against Gal/GalNAc residues and from hydrogen bonding between aa's and hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate ligands.""
 'Some are dimeric or oligomeric forms of simple β-trefoil subunits (prototype R-type lectin); others are tandem-repeat R-type lectins having two CRDs in the polypeptide chain. Chimeric forms have functional domains (enzymes, toxins) associated with R-type lectin, similar to those in plants and bacteria. Diverse forms of R-type lectins have been found in fungi (Chapter 23). Some consist solely of β-trefoil subunits. A dimeric prototype R-type lectin CNL (PDB 3NBE), from the conifer-loving mushroom C. nebularis, exerts nematocidal activity by binding to GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc glycan expressed in nematodes. CNL and another prototype R-type lectin, BEL (PDB 4I4X), from Boletus edulis, which binds to T-antigen, inhibit growth of cultured mammalian tumor cells. Chimeric forms in fungi include R-type lectin domains connected to tyrosinase-domain (PPO3: PDB 2Y9W), peptide N-glycanase-like-domain (MOA: PDB 2IHO), and aerolysin-like domain (LSL: PDB 1W3A). LSL from Laetiporus sulphureus (a bracket fungus) has a β-trefoil fold but not a Q-x-W motif. Studies of R-type lectins in protists are at an early stage. One was recently found in the anaerobic parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Chapter 43), a Gal/GalNAc-binding prototype R-type lectin (PDB 6IFB) consisting of two β-trefoil subunits. In each subunit, the α- and β-subdomain functioned, respectively, to capture carbohydrates and subunits connected by a disulfide bond. Prototype and tandem-repeat R-type lectins consisting solely of β-trefoil domains have been identified in various invertebrate groups, including sponges (phylum Porifera), earthworms (Annelida) (EW29: PDB 2ZQN), bivalves (Mollusca) (UniProt A0A646QVV9), and brachiopods (Brachiopoda) (UniProt A0A646QV64). SeviL (PDB 6LF2), in mussels, binds to the trisaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Gal, a component of gangliosides GM1b (Siaα2-3 Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1Cer) and GA1 (Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1Cer). GM1b is a target antigen of Guillain-Barré syndrome (Chapter 11), which arises from Campylobacter infection because structures of some bacterial lipopolysaccharides mimic those of the ganglioside (Chapter 20). Interaction between prototype R-type lectin and ganglioside-induced cytotoxicity against mammalian neoplastic cells through activation of MAP kinases. Another family of mussel lectins (MytiLec: PDB 3WMV; CGL: PDB 5F90) has a β-trefoil fold but not Q-x-W motif. Similar to Shiga toxins (Chapter 37), these lectins captured three Gb3 (Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc) glycans in three carbohydrate-binding pockets within the β-trefoil fold, and thereby induced signal transduction. Chimera-type R-type lectins connect with various functional domains in invertebrates. Pierisin in cabbage butterfly (Arthropoda, order Lepidoptera) larvae expresses R-type lectin domain at the carboxyl terminus of an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (Uniprot Q9U8Q4) and induces apoptosis of cancer cells.'
 ""Each subdomain could conceivably have a carbohydrate-binding site; however, in most R-type lectins only one or two subdomains bind a carbohydrate ligand. Carbohydrate-binding of RCA-I and RCA-II arises from aromatic amino acids stacking against Gal/GalNAc residues and from hydrogen bonding between aa's and hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate ligands. A wide variety of R-type lectins with diverse configurations, including RIP-IIs and heterotetramers such as RCA-II, have been purified from various plant tissues. Nontoxic lectins isolated from elderberry (genus Sambucus) bark include SSA (Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin) and SNA (Sambucus nigra agglutinin UniProt Q41358). These are useful because it is the rare R-type lectin that binds strongly to α2-6-linked sialic acid–modified glycans, but not to α2-3-linked sialylated ligands. Both are heterotetramers (∼140 kDa) composed of two heterodimers, each containing an A chain (resembling ricin A chain) disulfide-bonded to a B chain (R-type lectin). Expression of R-type lectins in roots and shoots of rice (Oryza sativa) was shown to be up-regulated in response to changing environmental conditions, based on genome informatics of Man and Gal-binding β-trefoil fold group EUL (UniProt B3SV73) found in Euonymus europaeus. Analysis of the promoter region of rice EUL genes revealed diverse stress-responsive elements. Analysis of expression profiles revealed that the genes were regulated in response to various types of stress (drought, osmotic, hormonal). Thus, β-trefoil fold lectins are involved in plant stress signaling and defense. Molecular structures of plant proteins having R-type lectin or β-trefoil fold domains vary extensively. Amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus) is an ancient South American crop plant with high nutritional value. Amaranthin (PDB 1JLX), purified from amaranth seeds, is a homodimeric lectin (Mr 66,000) consisting of two identical tandem-repeat β-trefoil fold domains. The primary structure of the lectin is ∼20% similar to that of ricin B-chain. Amaranthin specifically recognizes Thomsen–Fredenreich (TF or T antigen) (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) and sialyl-T (Siaα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) antigens. A GalNAc residue of the T-antigen disaccharide is captured by β- and γ-subdomains; thus, the mechanism of oligosaccharide binding by amaranthin differs from that of ricin B-chain and FGF (PDB 2AXM), in which a disaccharide is captured by a single subdomain. Phylogenetic survey of plant genomes revealed that many families have amaranthin-like R-type lectin domain sequences in their polypeptides. The sequences consist either of solely lectin domains (prototype R-type lectin), and include tandem repeats, or of a combination of lectin with various functional domains (chimera-type R-type lectin). Plants use R-type lectin domain by combining it with functional domains such as “aerolysin,” a pore-forming bacterial toxin. Tandem-repeat and chimera-type genes containing an amaranthin-like R-type lectin domain are expressed in many tissues and at different developmental stages, suggesting that R-type lectins respond to various external environmental stimuli. R-type lectins are present in fungi, protists, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Almost all of them have the same Q-x-W sequence and bind to Gal, GalNAc, and Man. Some are dimeric or oligomeric forms of simple β-trefoil subunits (prototype R-type lectin); others are tandem-repeat R-type lectins having two CRDs in the polypeptide chain. Chimeric forms have functional domains (enzymes, toxins) associated with R-type lectin, similar to those in plants and bacteria. Diverse forms of R-type lectins have been found in fungi (Chapter 23). Some consist solely of β-trefoil subunits.""
 ""Xyn10A acts as a glycoside hydrolase to catalyze cleavage of β1-4 xylose and can bind to xylan and a variety of soluble sugars, including Gal, lactose, and xylo- and arabino-oligosaccharides. Pore-forming domains are found in exotoxins produced by pathogenic bacteria that hemolyze erythrocytes. A monomeric lysin domain comprised of β-sheets oligomerizes like a piece of fabric tube to create pores on the cell wall. Aerolysin (Chapter 12) and hemolysin are bacterial toxins having R-type lectin domains. Many eukaryotes (plants, fungi, invertebrates) have aerolysin-like domains. Hemolysin (UniProt P09545) of Vibrio cholerae has a β-prism domain with jacalin (jackfruit lectin) structure, as well as R-type lectin domain. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) from Clostridium botulinum has extremely high toxicity (LD50: 0.001 µg/kg) (Chapter 37). A component of BoNT termed hemagglutinin HA1 (PDB 3AH2) is a tandem-repeat-type dimeric R-type lectin subunit that binds to Gal at the carboxy-terminal subdomain. HA2, a subunit with β-trefoil fold, connects to the amino-terminal subdomains of two HA1s and to the jelly-roll-like β-sandwich fold subunit HA3 (PDB 2ZOE) (Chapter 32). HA1 helps orient BoNT to target intestinal cells by binding to Gal or Sia in gangliosides (e.g., GT1b) (Chapter 11) or cell-surface glycans. MTX (UniProt Q03988), a mosquitocidal toxin found in Bacillus sphaericus, contains an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain and four R-type lectin domains, arranged in a structural configuration similar to that of pierisin in cabbage butterfly larvae. Subunit forms of MTX are the same as those of cholera toxin and ricin (i.e., they consist of A-subunit [toxic enzyme] and B-subunit [lectin]). R-type β-trefoil lectins have been identified in numerous species in the families Halobacteriaceae and Natrialbaceae (class Haloarchaea), whose cell walls have mucin-containing glycoproteins (Chapter 22). Based on successful experimental culture of an archaeal strain, a model was proposed in 2020 for eukaryogenesis from Archaea. An intriguing possibility is that domain Archaea is the link for R-type lectins between domains Bacteria and Eukarya. Type-C and type-D BoNTs have been produced from the genome of a Clostridium bacteriophage. Were R-type lectin genes somehow produced by viruses? Metagenomic analyses indicate the presence of R-type lectin genes (Uniprot Q5UPX2) in the viral family Mimiviridae (Chapters 8 and 20), and phylum Nucleocytoviricota. Recent surveys reveal that the genus Mimivirus is distributed worldwide in oceans as well as on land. Extensive future studies of comparative expression levels of viral R-type lectin genes will help clarify relationships between glycan-codes and specific environments in the world's ecosystems. The term “bricolage” refers to creation of novel tools in primitive societies in which availability of materials was limited. Creation of such tools may be based on tinkering with frameworks comprising limited sets of products and techniques used previously for other purposes. Analogously, modification and/or combination of genes in different groups of organisms may generate molecules useful for novel environmental responses. The β-trefoil fold structure, characteristic of the R-type lectin superfamily, is evidently a core framework in living systems that arose via bricolage and has evolved to play key roles in a variety of biochemical processes, including carbohydrate binding.

The beta-trefoil fold is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of R-type lectins and facilitating interactions with specific carbohydrate ligands, highlighting its importance in understanding lectin-glycan interactions and potential biotechnological applications of these proteins.","Beta-trefoil folds are a hallmark structural feature of R-type lectins that enable specificity in carbohydrate binding. These folds are observed in several protein families, including interleukin-1 and fibroblast growth factor, as key components in antigen-recognition and hormonal signalling cascades. Although beta-trefoil folds are a common subunit of R-type lectins, usually there are one or two subdomains responsible for recognizing and binding a carbohydrate ligand.",0.5,1.0,0.8700346353510853,0.038461538461538464,0.99999999998,0.6666666666666666
What is a common mechanism by which plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells?,"['Lectins and antibodies are useful for characterizing cell-surface glycans when limited numbers of cells are available. Studies on glycosylation of embryonic stem cells have been greatly aided by using panels of specific lectins to identify unique glycan determinants and changes in their expression during cellular differentiation. A recent variation of this approach is to use a microarray of immobilized lectins, which are probed with fluorescently labeled glycoproteins in extracts of cells. Such assays can reveal minor differences in protein glycosylation between different samples and give insight into the glycan structures that are present. One of the oldest uses of lectins is in the agglutination and precipitation of glycoconjugates, cells, and membrane vesicle preparations. The easiest assay for many soluble lectins that are multivalent is agglutination of target cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, or even bacteria or fungi. Agglutination can often be easily observed without a microscope, but it is also measurable in instruments such as aggregometers. In these assays, a lectin solution is serially diluted and the reciprocal of the final dilution that gives measurable cell agglutination is taken to define the activity. Bacterial agglutination by plant and animal lectins is often used to explore the surface glycocalyx and changes in glycocalyx on culture conditions and to define phenotypes of different strains or serotypes. Lectin precipitation and aggregation can be used to define the glycan composition and overall architecture of polysaccharides, as has been done for bacterial, algal, plant, and animal polysaccharides. Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. Fluorescent-tagged glycoproteins from a source (e.g., cell or tissue extracts) can be applied to these arrays and the binding pattern compared to a control sample can reveal features of the glycome of the material, such as patterns of sialylation, fucosylation, and even linkages of residues with glycans using linkage-specific reagents. The advantages of this approach is the microscale in which it can be performed, the relatively high-throughput nature of the technology, and the precision of discrimination in terms of differential glycosylation between two samples. The system is particularly adaptable to include new reagents as they become available (e.g., new lectins or engineered proteins). An important use of lectins and antibodies has been in the selection of cell lines (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] cells) that express altered cell-surface glycans. The common lectins that have been used are ConA, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin), L-PHA, LCA, PSA (Pisum sativum agglutinin), E-PHA, ricin, modeccin, and abrin. The latter three lectins are heterodimeric, disulfide-bonded proteins that are classified as type-II ribosome-inactivating proteins; they contain an A subunit that constitutes an enzyme called RNA-N-glycosidase, which inactivates the 28S ribosome, and a B subunit that is a galactose-binding lectin (Chapter 31). Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture. One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained.'
 'The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class. Interestingly, some legume lectins have a hydrophobic binding site that binds adenine and adenine-derived plant hormones with micromolar affinity; this is two to three orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for monosaccharides. Three of these lectins (the soybean agglutinin, phytohemagglutinin L [PHAL], and Dolichos biflorus lectin) have been crystallized and found to have a unique tetrameric structure, in that the dimer–dimer interface creates a channel running through the center of the tetramer. Two identical adenine-binding sites are found at opposite ends of this channel. Another common feature of the legume lectins is that they are secretory proteins and undergo cotranslational signal peptide removal, which accompanies their entry into the secretory system. All but peanut agglutinin (PNA) are N-glycosylated as precursors; the N-glycans undergo normal posttranslational modification as they transit the Golgi apparatus. The lectins vary from one another as to whether the mature proteins contain oligomannose-type, complex-type, or a mixture of both types of N-glycans. The lectins may also undergo a variety of proteolytic modifications as they transit through the secretory system. Some of the lectins are cleaved to generate a β-chain, corresponding to the amino terminus and an α-chain corresponding to the carboxyl terminus. For example, the pea lectin and favin (the lectin from Vicia faba) are tetrameric glycoproteins that contain two types of subunits, α and β, which are ∼5 kDa and ∼21 kDa, respectively. These two lectins are each synthesized as single polypeptide precursors that contain the sequences of both chains in the following orientation: β-chain–α-chain. The chains associate to form dimers; they are then proteolytically processed in the protein bodies to form tetramers containing two separate α- and β-chains. Other lectins may undergo carboxy-terminal trimming of only some of their subunits. For example, the soybean agglutinin, phytohemagglutinin E (E-PHA), and D. biflorus lectins are tetramers of equimolar mixtures of intact and trimmed subunits. The most intriguing proteolytic modification occurs in the case of ConA. A small segment is removed from the interior of the protein and the original amino terminus is ligated with the original carboxyl terminus. This forms what is termed a circularly permuted protein. The N-glycosylated segment of the protein is removed during this transpeptidation process; thus, the mature ConA is not a glycoprotein, in contrast to most seed lectins in the Fabaceae family, which have N-glycans. Thus, the protein sequence of isolated ConA aligns with other seed lectins, whereas the alignment of the DNA encoding the protein with other lectin genes indicates that the gene is circularly permuted. Despite years of research, the intrinsic biological roles of L-type lectins are poorly understood. The glycan-binding specificity can vary significantly; ConA binds mannose and glucose-containing glycans, whereas the lectins from the trees Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra bind to sialylated glycans (see Chapters 15, 29, and 31). There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development.'
 'There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development. L-type lectins are involved in the symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as in Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, but the precise function of lectins in this regard is unclear. A recent study has shown that the D. biflorus seed lectin is also a lipoxygenase. It will be of interest to see how many other L-type lectins have this activity, which is necessary to initiate the wound-induced defense pathway in plants. Regardless of their physiological function, legume L-type lectins might be useful in applications requiring agents with antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal or antinociceptive properties. In addition, given their well-established glycan recognition preferences, these plant lectins are useful for glycophenotyping different cell types in physiological and pathological settings by means of immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical analysis. Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) are homologous molecular chaperones that mediate quality control of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (see Chapter 39). Although CRT is a soluble ER luminal component, CNX is membrane-bound and is perhaps closely associated with the protein-translocating channel that imports nascent proteins into the ER. Both CNX and CRT bind to monoglucosylated, high-mannose-type glycans and prevent their exit from the ER until they are properly folded and assembled into correct quaternary structures (Chapter 39). For example, generation of a functional major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) depends on its association with CRT or CNX as component of a peptide-loading complex and the antigen presentation machinery. During the binding and dissociation from CRT or CNX, if the glycoprotein folds correctly, then glucose removal by glucosidase-II allows its passage out of the ER. If a glycoprotein misfolds or aggregates, it is reglucosylated by UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) containing four tandem thioredoxin-like domains; this enzyme only recognizes misfolded or aggregated glycoproteins. Following reglucosylation, the monoglucosylated protein binds again to CRT or CNX. Thus, there is a cycle of glucose removal and addition by the alternating actions of glucosidase-II and UGGT and interactions with CNX/CRT. Both CRT and CNX are Ca++-binding proteins, and their carbohydrate-binding activity is sensitive to changes in Ca++ concentration. CNX is a type I membrane protein with its carboxy-terminal end in the cytoplasm. The lumenal portion of the protein is divided into three domains: a Ca++-binding domain (which is adjacent to the transmembrane domain), a proline-rich long hairpin loop called the P domain, and the amino-terminal L-type lectin domain. CRT has a similar structure, but it is missing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions; it is retained in the ER through its KDEL-retrieval signal at the carboxyl terminus (Figure 32.4). Schematic representations of calreticulin (CRT) and calnexin (CNX) showing the lectin domain, the P domain (containing the proline repeats), and the calcium-binding domain (A,B).

ERGIC-53 (human gene LMAN1) and its sequence-related proteins ERGL and VIP36 are type I membrane proteins that participate in vesicular protein transport in the secretory system (see Chapter 39). All share an L-type lectin folding motif. Orthologs of ERGIC-53 are found in plants and all animals and have been independently identified as being important in production of infectious viruses (e.g., coronavirus and filovirus).'
 'One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained. More details about glycosylation mutants of cultured cells are presented in Chapter 49. The specificity of lectins and antibodies to particular glycans has made them especially useful in cloning genes encoding glycosyltransferases or other proteins required for proper glycosylation, such as nucleotide sugar transporters. For example, CHO cells and the African green monkey kidney cell line COS lack glycans with terminal α-galactose residues. Consequently, the cells do not bind the plant lectin GSI-B4 (Figure 48.3). When transfected with a cDNA library prepared from cells that do express terminal α-galactose residues (such as murine teratocarcinoma cells F9), cells that have taken up a plasmid encoding the cognate α1-3 galactosyltransferase and express terminal α-residues bind to GSI-B4 and can be identified with plates coated with the lectin. Isolation of plasmids from the bound cells and repeated recloning and reexpression by this technique (called expression cloning) led to the identification of a specific gene encoding the murine α1-3 galactosyltransferase (Ggta1). Similar approaches using an antibody to the Lewis x antigen (SSEA-1) led to cloning of the Lewis blood group Fuct-III. Related approaches using antibodies and lectins to other glycan structures and wild-type CHO cells and CHO mutants led to the identification of the genes encoding many other glycosyltransferases, including some involved in extending glycosphingolipids and nucleotide sugar transporters, such as the transporter for CMP-NeuAc. Such approaches based on lectin selection are also useful with yeast. For example, the gene encoding a yeast N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAcT) was identified by expression cloning using a GlcNAcT-deficient yeast. The mannan chains of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis normally contain some terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues that are bound by the plant lectin GSL-II, which binds terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues (Figure 48.4). A mutant lacking the GlcNAcT and lacking terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues on mannoproteins was identified. Transformation of yeast with DNA containing the gene encoding the GlcNAcT led to yeast clones that were bound by the fluorescently labeled GSL-II. This strategy was used to identify the gene encoding the GlcNAcT. The transporters for UDP-Gal in Leishmania parasites and in the plant Arabidopsis were also identified by expression cloning in Lec8 CHO cells; these cells have a mutation in their endogenous UDP-Gal transporter, and consequently lack galactose-containing glycans on their surface. For the UDP-Gal transporter from Arabidopsis, Lec8 cells were cotransfected with a cDNA library encoding the putative Arabidopsis UDP-Gal transporter, along with a glucuronosyltransferase that can lead to synthesis of the unsulfated version of the HNK epitope (Figure 48.6), GlcAβ1-3Galβ-R that is bound by a specific antibody. This identification strategy led to the expression cloning of several UDP-Gal transporters from Arabidopsis. CHO and COS cell lines have also been useful in characterizing the activities of novel glycosyltransferase genes that were identified by other approaches. For example, candidate fucosyltransferase genes encoding α1-2 or α1-3 fucosyltransferases have been expressed in CHO and COS cells, which lack these enzymes.'
 'These interactions can take various forms, resulting in movement of molecules, cells, and information. Directing movement of glycoproteins within and between cells is a common function for lectins in many organisms. In eukaryotic cells, including yeast as well as “higher” eukaryotes, several groups of lectins are important in glycoprotein biosynthesis and intracellular movement (Chapter 39). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), two lectins—calnexin and calreticulin—bind monoglucosylated high-mannose glycans present on newly synthesized glycoproteins, forming part of a quality control system for protein folding. This binding keeps proteins in the ER until they are correctly folded. Other groups of lectins in the ER, including M-type lectins and proteins containing mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domains, take part in the process of ER-associated glycoprotein degradation (ERAD), binding partially processed high-mannose glycans on terminally misfolded glycoproteins, causing them to be retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm for deglycosylation, followed by degradation in the proteasome. One of the best characterized functions of GBPs is in delivery of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi to lysosomes. P-type lectins (Chapter 33) recognize mannose 6-phosphate residues that have been added to N-glycans on lysosomal enzymes in the Golgi apparatus, targeting them to endosomes for fusion with lysosomes. Once released from cells, glycoproteins can also be taken up for degradation in lysosomes. As noted above, the ASGPR on mammalian hepatocytes controls turnover of many serum glycoproteins by recognition of terminal Gal or GalNAc residues. Similarly, the mannose receptor on macrophages and sinusoidal cells of the liver binds and clears glycoproteins with oligomannose N-glycans that are released from cells during inflammation and tissue damage. Not all lectin-mediated targeting leads to degradation. Glycan-binding subunits of secreted bacterial and plant toxins typically target them to glycolipids on cell surfaces and facilitate entry of the toxins into cells (Chapter 37). Many enzymes contain glycan-binding domains that bring another domain with enzyme activity into close proximity with its substrates. One notable group includes bacterial cellulases in which cellulose-binding modules position the enzymatic domain for optimal degradation of cellulose fibers. Following a similar principle, GalNAc-binding domains in polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases that initiate O-linked glycosylation in animals position these enzymes to add further GalNAc residues to regions of polypeptides that already bear O-glycans (Chapter 10). Distinctive glycans on the surfaces of different eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells make them targets for GBPs. Binding of glycans on the surface of one cell by GBPs on an adjacent cell can induce recognition and adhesion, whereas cross-linking glycans on different cells by multivalent soluble lectins provides an alternative mechanism. Such interactions are exploited in specialized situations exemplified by transient contacts between moving cells. The selectins—three receptors that function in interactions between white blood cells, platelets, and endothelia—provide some of the best characterized examples of lectin–glycan interactions in cell–cell adhesion (Chapter 34). For example, L-selectin on lymphocytes binds glycans on specialized endothelial cells of lymph nodes to induce lymphocyte homing, wherein circulating lymphocytes leave the bloodstream and enter the lymph node. Other mammalian GBPs that mediate binding of cells to each other or that recognize ligands on the same cell surface include Siglecs (Chapter 35) and galectins (Chapter 36). Lectins in multicellular organisms also mediate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix and support the organization of matrix components. For example, proteins containing link modules that bind specifically to hyaluronan in cartilage (and other tissues) are essential for structuring the extracellular matrix (Chapter 38), and other extracellular proteins bind to sulfated GAGs to organize cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (Chapter 38). Many bacteria also use lectins to adhere to glycans on host cells, often keeping them from getting washed away.']","Plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells through mechanisms such as the induction of apoptosis, potentially by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors.","Many plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas other lectins, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not toxic to animal cells in culture.

How do conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates?,"['Regardless of the mechanisms involved, certain sialylated molecules are also specific markers for some cancers and potential ligands for targeted therapies (Chapter 47). Each role of Sias in physiology and pathology provides opportunities for therapeutic development. Best known are competitive inhibitors of viral sialidases (Relenza and Tamiflu), which hinder budding and spreading of susceptible strains of influenza A and B viruses (Chapters 42 and 57). Another strategy to block Sia-binding pathogens has been to engineer therapeutic sialidases to remove pathogen-binding sites on human tissues. Efforts to use sialoglycans themselves as anti-infectives have not been as successful, although sialylated milk oligosaccharides have been claimed to have some value. Sia-mimetic drugs designed to bind to and block selectins (e.g., rivipansel) have shown promise in human trials as anti-inflammatory drugs. Strategies are also under study for inducing immune attack of cancer cells with sialoglycoconjugates and for suppressing antibody responses by engaging Siglecs on B cells. Many sialoglycoproteins have been developed as drugs, including erythropoietin to enhance blood cell production and monoclonal antibodies to target various diseases including cancers (Chapter 57). In these cases, appropriate sialylation is a desired goal, not only to optimize serum half-life, stability, and receptor binding, but also to assure FDA approval. Chemical, recombinant, and other methods are thus in use to maintain appropriate sialylation on biological drugs, and efforts are underway to engineer “humanized” glycosylation (including sialylation) in yeast, insect, or plant cells (that do not typically express Sias but are more economical sources of expressed glycoproteins) (Chapter 56). Notably, differences in sialylation of endogenous and exogenous erythropoietin are used by the World Anti-Doping Agency to detect illicit administration, and have resulted in rescinding of many Olympic and Tour de France medals. The presence of Neu5Gc is of potential importance in biotherapeutics, because humans have circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, with marked variations in levels and isotypes. The use of animal-derived proteins in biopharmaceutical development can lead to Neu5Gc incorporation, with unwanted results. Similarly, cell therapies under development often use animal sera or support cells, which can provide Neu5Gc to the cell products. Finally, Neu5Gc on animal organs likely contributes to the failure of xenotransplantation (use of animal organs in humans), which led to engineering of CMAH knockout pigs. Early studies suggested species specificity in the occurrence of specific Sia variants. With analytical improvements, it became evident that Sia variations are more widely expressed across species but occur at differing levels. Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage (Chapter 27), which comprises vertebrates and some “higher” invertebrates (such as echinoderms). Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates. This may change as molecular techniques improve. For example, insects were believed to be free of Sias until their discovery in cicada Malpighian tubules and Drosophila brains, and later identification of a single Drosophila gene (SiaT) with sequence similarities to mammalian STs. When SiaT is inactivated, flies suffer locomotor abnormalities and defects in neuromuscular junctions. Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila. Sias have also been reported in the nervous systems of behaviorally complex protostomes like octopus and squid. On the other hand, no Sias or ST genes were found in the well-studied round worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25). It appears that Sias (other than Kdn, which probably appeared earlier) were “invented” in a common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes and then became essential in deuterostomes, while being partially or completely discarded in some protostome lineages. Interestingly, there is wide variation in Sia expression and complexity within deuterostomes, with the sialome of echinoderms appearing very complex and that of humans being among the simplest.'
 'The first mammalian Sia-binding protein found was the complement regulatory molecule factor H, a soluble serum factor that binds cell-surface Sias and protects cells from autoimmune attack, providing recognition of “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), which are also recognized by CD33-related Siglecs (Chapter 35). Human mutations in the Sia-binding site of factor H result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, a disease caused by excessive complement activation, because of the failure of factor H function. Other variations of the factor H polyanion binding region increase the risk of age-dependent macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness resulting from inflammation in the eye retina. Sias are also involved in interactions of white blood cells with the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Circulating neutrophils must bind to and move across the blood vessel wall to clear bacterial infections in tissues. Endothelial cells respond to nearby bacterial infection and quickly send Sia-binding lectins to their surface. E- and P-selectins (Chapter 34) connect with passing neutrophils, which have the complementary sialoglycans on their surface lipids or proteins. Initially rolling, and finally snagged, neutrophils then respond to other signals (including cytokines presented by GAGs; Chapter 17) and work their way into the tissue to fight bacteria. Without Sia-dependent binding by E- and P-selectins, inflammation is compromised and persistent tissue infections ensue. A related lectin, L-selectin, is also involved in trafficking of lymphocytes from blood to lymph. Siglecs (Sia-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) constitute a Sia-binding family within the I-type lectins (Chapter 35). In humans, there are 14 Siglecs with sialic acid–dependent functions (13 and 17 are missing in humans and 12 does not bind sialic acid), all but one of which are found on the surface of different blood cell types. In several cases, binding of Siglecs to their sialoglycan targets on other cells or their own cell surface modulates ongoing immune responses, either damping them to protect from hyperimmune reactions or activating them. The one Siglec not found in the immune system, Siglec-4 (myelin-associated glycoprotein), is in the nervous system, where it aids cell–cell interactions between nerve cells and myelin, the protective and insulating membrane sheath essential to rapid nerve conduction. Notably, all the above examples of vertebrate Sia-recognizing proteins were discovered serendipitously, via the unexpected abrogating effect of sialidases on a biological process. To date, there has been no systematic effort to search for other examples, but other likely vertebrate Sia-binding lectins are PECAM-1, PILRs, L1-CAM, HMGB-1, and an as-yet-unidentified uterine agglutinin. The many functions of Sias in vertebrates make these molecules particularly attractive targets for microbes that co-exist with the host, whether harmoniously or not. As discussed elsewhere, there are several independent mechanisms of Sia mimicry, which promote bacterial interactions with host factor H and Siglecs to enable survival in the host. Some Sia-binding lectins are found in organisms that do not themselves appear to express Sias (see Table 15.1 for examples). In these cases, Sia binding may defend against sialylated pathogens, such as the protein limulin in the hemolymph (blood-like fluid) of the horseshoe crab, which can trigger foreign cell lysis. Sia-binding lectins in plants, such as elderberry shrubs, may suppress consumption by animals. Of course, some of these Sia-binding properties might be incidental, with the true lectin ligands being related to prokaryotic NulOs such as Leg or Pse, and/or Kdo, which is also found in some plants. Although cell lines deficient in Sias grow in culture, disruption of Sia synthesis in mice results in lethality at embryonic day 8.5, with poor differentiation of nerve cells as well as cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. In contrast, disruption of some ST genes in mice is relatively well tolerated, in some cases because of complementarity among related genes.'
 'An extreme example of these biophysical effects is polySia, whose functional impacts are detailed above. Given Sia abundance on cell surfaces (see Figure 15.3), it is not surprising that numerous animal pathogens evolved to target these molecules. Indeed, highly specific Sia-binding proteins were first discovered on human pathogens and their toxins. In the search for host cell receptors for influenza viruses, it was discovered that isolated viruses cross-linked red blood cells, resulting in hemagglutination. Over time, the red cells dispersed and could no longer be agglutinated by fresh viruses. This led to the concept of a viral “hemagglutinin” (a term still used in virus typing; e.g., the “H” in H1N1) that binds to a receptor on the red blood cell, which is also susceptible to a “receptor destroying enzyme” from the virus. The component released by receptor-destroying enzyme was identified as Sia, the hemagglutinin as a Sia-binding protein, and the receptor-destroying enzyme as a sialidase (viral neuraminidase, the “N” in H1N1). Interestingly, the Sia-linkage specificity of the hemagglutinin defines host restrictions; with bird influenza virus preferentially binding to Sias in α2-3-linkage and human virus to Sias in α2-6-linkage. Scientists monitoring influenza virus outbreaks test α2-3- versus α2-6-specificity to detect potential emerging human influenza strains. Molecules designed to block the viral sialidases are useful anti-influenza drugs (Chapter 57). Sia-specific binding proteins are widespread in pathogens and include numerous viral hemagglutinins, bacterial adhesins, bacterial toxins, and parasite-binding proteins (see Table 15.1 for a few examples). Helicobacter pylori causes stomach ulcers and cancers. It expresses a Sia-specific adhesin called SabA, which contributes to its chronic colonization of the stomach lining. The merozoite stage of the malarial parasite P. falciparum can bind to erythrocyte sialoglycans to initiate cell entry. Several bacterial toxins also target sialoglycans. Cholera toxin and the structurally related E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin both bind to Sias on ganglioside GM1 on the intestinal epithelium, whereas tetanus and related botulinum toxins bind to more complex gangliosides (Chapter 37). The toxin from the human pathogen Salmonella Typhi binds specifically to Neu5Ac on glycans but not Neu5Gc; influenza C virus expresses a hemagglutinin that binds only to 9-O-acetylated Sias. The complexities of Sia diversification are thought to be the outcome of an ongoing evolutionary “arms race” between animals and microbial pathogens (Chapter 20). In this regard, it is notable that O-acetyl and N-glycolyl groups on Sias can limit action of bacterial sialidases and block the binding of some pathogens. Alternately, the same modifications may facilitate binding of pathogens that have adapted to them. Sialoglycans at environmental surfaces (like mucins) or free in biological fluids might provide protection by virtue of their “decoy” inhibition of microbial adherence and/or sialidases. The evolutionary persistence of sialoglycans despite their role in virulent diseases suggests critical physiological roles, some of which are addressed below. A few classic examples of sialic acid–binding proteins in nature  Sias in vertebrates can act as “biological masks,” preventing recognition of underlying glycans (especially β-linked Gal residues) by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins. They are also essential components of recognition molecules, with roles that vary according to cell type, tissue type, and species. The first mammalian Sia-binding protein found was the complement regulatory molecule factor H, a soluble serum factor that binds cell-surface Sias and protects cells from autoimmune attack, providing recognition of “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), which are also recognized by CD33-related Siglecs (Chapter 35). Human mutations in the Sia-binding site of factor H result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, a disease caused by excessive complement activation, because of the failure of factor H function.'
 'Siglec-15 was first described as a highly conserved ancient Siglec in vertebrates. It lacks the typical arrangement of cysteines seen in the V-set Ig domain of other Siglecs and has an unusual intron–exon arrangement. Nevertheless, it can bind the Sialyl-Tn structure (Neu5Acα2-6GalNAcα) and other structures containing a Neu5Acα2-6HexNAc determinant. It associates with DAP12 but also has an ITIM-like motif in its cytoplasmic tail. Although first reported on macrophages and DCs in human lymphoid tissues, Siglec-15 is most strongly expressed in osteoclasts and their precursors in which it plays an important role, together with receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (RANK), in triggering osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclasts are key cells involved in bone degradation and share a common hemopoietic progenitor with macrophages. Mice lacking Siglec-15 show a mild osteopetrosis and impaired osteoclast differentiation. Specific antibodies against Siglec-15 phenocopy this state, because of antibody-induced internalization and degradation of Siglec-15. In addition, Siglec-15 is expressed in some tumor tissues (tumor-associated macrophages and cancer cells), and an antibody against Siglec-15 was shown to suppress the growth of a mouse melanoma in vivo. Siglec-15 therefore provides a novel target for diseases, such as menopause-related osteoporosis and cancer. Genes encoding most of the CD33rSiglec subfamily are clustered on human chromosome 19q13.3-13.4 or the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7. They include CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglecs-5 through -12, Siglec-14, and Siglec-16 in humans and CD33 and Siglecs-E, -F, -G, and -H in mice. Similar clusters are found in other mammals. It is difficult to assign all definitive orthologs between primates and rodents, resulting in different nomenclatures. One reason is that most IgSF domains are encoded by exons with phase-1 splice junctions, allowing exon shuffling without disrupting open reading frames, resulting in hybrid genes that are difficult to distinguish from similarly organized genes in other species. A second reason is that the Sia-binding V-set domains of the CD33rSiglecs are rapidly evolving, presumably to adjust their binding specificity to the rapid evolution of the endogenous host sialome, as well as evasion of binding by pathogens via molecular mimicry (Chapter 15) or specific protein-mediated interactions (see below). There are also multiple gene conversion events between adjacent genes and pseudogenes within this cluster. Of interest is the finding that humans show many CD33rSiglec differences compared with our closest evolutionary cousins (the chimpanzees), more than the differences between mice and rats, which shared a common ancestor much earlier (see below). As mentioned earlier, an “essential” arginine residue in all known Siglecs is required for binding Sia-containing ligands. This residue is often mutated in nature, resulting in loss of binding ability. Examples include Siglec-12 in humans, Siglecs-5 and -14 in the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, Siglec-6 in the baboon, and Siglec-H in the rat. The common arginine codon (CGN, where N is any nucleotide) tends to be highly mutable because of the CpG sequence (which is prone to TpG or CpA transition via cytosine methylation–deamination). However, the frequency with which such events occur suggests that it might be a natural mechanism to eliminate Sia binding of a given Siglec, when such activity becomes inappropriate under changing evolutionary pressures, without causing a complete loss of the Siglec. Overall, it appears that this class of SIGLEC genes is subject to multiple “Red Queen” effects in evolution, in which evolutionary changes of sialyltransferases in response to the emergence of Sia-binding pathogens may lead to subsequent evolutionary changes of Siglec specificities (Figure 35.4). Probable evolutionary chain of Red Queen effects involving Sias and CD33rSiglecs. See text for discussion.'
 'Use of α2-3 or α2-8-specific sialidases can provide some insight on Sia linkages as well. Sia-glycosides are also more susceptible to acid hydrolysis than most other sugars, being released using 0.1 m HCl or even with weak acids like 2 m acetic acid or propionic acid at 80°C (albeit still with some loss or migration of labile modifications). This allows selective release of Sias from complex glycans for subsequent analysis by chromatographic methods. Free Sias react with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) to generate fluorescent compounds amenable to qualitative and quantitative high-pressure liquid chromatography. There are still some major limitations to methods available for Sia analysis. For example, some mass spectrometric methods result in selective loss of Sias before mass detection. Some Sia-linkages are partly or completely resistant to sialidases and some are even relatively resistant to acid release. In terms of identifying Sia modifications, the most accurate analysis requires complete release and purification with the modifications intact. The stability of each modification to analytical conditions must be considered—for example, O-acetyl groups are labile to common methods that use alkaline conditions (permethylation and beta-elimination). Sia-binding lectins are also useful for detecting sialoglycans and their linkages in situ and on isolated sialoglycans. Sambucus nigra (elderberry) lectin binds selectively to α2-6-linked Sias and Maackia amurensis lectins bind selectively to α2-3-linked Sias. Because plants do not express Sias, these lectins may perhaps deter animal ingestion. Alternatively, the natural ligands of these lectins may not be Sias. Improved probes are now being developed, taking advantage of the fact that many microbes have spent millions of years optimizing their binding to vertebrate sialomes (e.g., the B subunits of various toxins). An interesting tool for detecting a specific Sia modification is the hemagglutinin of influenza C or bovine coronavirus, which bind specifically to 9-O-acetyl Sias on isolated sialoglycans, cells, and tissues, if the esterase function is inactivated. Sias are endowed with a rich diversity of chemical modalities within a single monosaccharide, which evolution uses to modulate the biophysical environment, to mask underlying glycans, and for specific recognition by complementary Sia-binding proteins that mediate biological processes. These functions are not mutually exclusive—for example, highly sialylated molecules with major biophysical roles (such as mucins) may also express specific sialoglycans that serve as ligands in recognition processes. For simplicity, different roles of Sias are addressed separately below. Mucins are heavily glycosylated O-GalNAc-modified sialoglycoproteins secreted or membrane-bound at epithelial surfaces in airways and in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of animals (Chapter 10). Mucins can be remarkably large (several in the range of 5 to >20 MDa). Their dense anionic charge and their propensity to bind water make them efficient as a hydrating and protective barrier at tissue surfaces in contact with the environment. On mucins, as well as other glycoproteins, closely spaced O-GalNAc-linked sialoglycans generate extended polypeptide configurations that would collapse without glycosylation. Clustered sialoglycans along the polypeptide chain can also protect the underlying protein from proteases. Membrane-bound sialoglycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are often quite dense, provide cell surface anionic charge that acts as a barrier and regulates cell surface functions. An extreme example of these biophysical effects is polySia, whose functional impacts are detailed above. Given Sia abundance on cell surfaces (see Figure 15.3), it is not surprising that numerous animal pathogens evolved to target these molecules. Indeed, highly specific Sia-binding proteins were first discovered on human pathogens and their toxins. In the search for host cell receptors for influenza viruses, it was discovered that isolated viruses cross-linked red blood cells, resulting in hemagglutination.']","Conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates, with Sias being prominent in the deuterostome lineage, which includes vertebrates and certain ""higher"" invertebrates like echinoderms. While Sias are generally not reported in plants or invertebrates, there have been discoveries challenging this notion. For example, insects were initially believed to lack Sias until their identification in specific insect species like cicadas and Drosophila. The presence of Sias in behaviorally complex protostomes such as octopus and squid's nervous systems further highlights the variability in Sia expression across different species within the deuterostome lineage.","Ancestral sialyltransferase families in invertebrates have been identified through sequence-based analysis showing orthology with the last common vertebrate ancestor. Increased diversity within vertebrate lineages is inferred to have resulted from divergent evolution, with a variety of gain-of-function and loss-of-function events identified in sialyltransferases throughout their evolutionary history.",1.0,0.8940677553250768,0.5615391713587868,0.007633587786259542,0.999999999975,0.0
What's the relationship between Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes and plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis?,"['In contrast, homogalacturonan is continually modified by the action of wall enzymes and its contribution to wall architecture is therefore time dependent. Increased knowledge of the physical properties of primary wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans is required to understand how modulating the amounts and structural features of a few common polysaccharides and glycan domains lead to primary walls with diverse properties and functionalities. Further research is also needed to determine if wall structure and function results from the noncovalent interactions of polysaccharides and proteoglycans or from the formation of glycan-containing architectural units with specific structural and functional roles. The latter scenario is analogous to the organization of proteoglycans and O-linked mucins in the extracellular matrix of animal cells (Chapters 10, 16, and 17). The secondary walls of woody tissue and grasses are composed predominantly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and the polyphenol lignin. The inclusion of lignin results in a hydrophobic composite that is a major contributor to the structural characteristics of secondary walls. Heteroxylans are the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide present in the secondary (lignified) cell walls of seed-producing plants. These heteroxylans are classified according to the type and abundance of the substituents on the 1-4-linked β-D-Xylp residues of the polysaccharide backbone. Glucuronoxylans, which are major components in the secondary walls of woody and herbaceous eudicots, have an α-D-GlcpA or MeGlcpA substituent at O-2 (Figure 24.1C). Gymnosperm secondary walls contain arabinoglucuronoxylans (AGXs), which in addition to MeGlcpA substituents, have Araf residues attached to O-3 of some of the backbone residues. The glucuronoarabinoxylans in the secondary walls of grasses typically contain fewer Araf residues than their primary wall counterpart (Figure 24.1D). Ferulic or coumaric acids are often esterified to the Araf residues of xylan in grass primary and secondary cells walls. There is some evidence that the lignin polymer is covalently linked to the secondary wall hemicelluloses. Eudicot and gymnosperm secondary wall xylans have a well-defined glycosyl sequence 1-4-β-D-Xylp-1-3-α-L-Rhap-1-2-α-D-GalpA-1-4-D-Xylp at their reducing end (Figure 24.1C). This sequence is required for normal xylan synthesis during secondary cell-wall formation and may have a role in regulating the polymers chain length. This sequence is present at the reducing end of heteroxylans of all monocots except the grasses. Genes that encode polysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes, including many of those required for xyloglucan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose synthesis and some of those required for pectin synthesis, have been identified. This information, together with improved methods to demonstrate enzymatic activity of recombinant plant GTs in vitro and wall structural analyses of the corresponding plant mutants is providing a framework for an increased understanding of how plant cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized. Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles. This is in contrast to cellulose, which is synthesized at the plasma membrane where the glucan chains are extruded into the apoplast to form cellulose microfibrils. Lignin is polymerized in the apoplast by nonenzymatic radical reactions. Despite advances in identifying and understanding the GTs involved in polysaccharide synthesis, we still do not know how many of the wall polymers are synthesized by Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes or if they are assembled by GTs localized in different regions of the Golgi apparatus. We also do not understand how the newly synthesized polymers are assembled into a functional cell wall in the apoplast. Plants produce glycoproteins and proteoglycans that contain oligo- or polysaccharides that are linked to hydroxyproline (Hyp) and serine (Ser).'
 ""Because of its abundance, plant biomass is also considered as a renewable, carbon-neutral feedstock for the production of biofuels, biomaterials, and other value-added commodity chemicals (Chapter 59). Primary cell walls are composites that resemble fiber-reinforced porous, aqueous gels. The complex structures and functions of these walls result from the assembly and interactions of a limited number of structurally defined polysaccharides and proteoglycans. Nevertheless, wall structure and organization differ between plant species and in different tissue and cell types within a plant. Moreover, during cell division and differentiation, and in response to biotic and abiotic challenges, a cell often responds by the differential synthesis and modification of the noncellulosic components or by the addition of new components. Primary walls of land plants contain cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, in different proportions. They also contain structural proteins/proteoglycans, enzymes, low-molecular-weight phenolics, and minerals. Pectin and hemicellulose are present in approximately equal amounts in the so-called type I primary walls of gymnosperms, dicots, and nongraminaceous monocots, whereas hemicellulose is far more abundant than pectin in the type II walls of the grasses. Recent studies of walls from diverse land plants and cell type–specific characterization of wall glycans indicate that the breadth of wall composition and structural diversity is enormous and thus one should think of walls as a structural continuum rather than specific types. Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer in nature, is a linear glycan composed of 1-4-linked β-D-Glcp residues (Figure 24.1A). Several of these chains are hydrogen bonded to one another to form paracrystalline microfibrils. Each microfibril is predicted to contain between 18 and 24 glucan chains. The glucan chain is synthesized by a cellulose synthase complex at the cell's plasma membrane. Three cellulose synthases, encoded by three different genes, are believed to interact to form a trimeric complex, which in turn assembles into a hexameric rosette at the plasma membrane. The catalytic site of each cellulose synthase is located in the cytosol and transfers glucose from UDP-Glcp onto the elongating glucan chain. The mechanisms involved in the formation of a microfibril from individual glucan chains are not well understood, although it may involve an assembly process that is facilitated by specific proteins. The newly formed microfibrils are deposited in the wall of a growing cell with an orientation that is transverse to the axis of elongation. This orientation may be guided in part by protein-mediated interactions between cellulose synthase proteins and cortical microtubules. Many properties of native cellulose depend on interactions that occur at the surface of the microfibrils. The surface chains are accessible and reactive, whereas the hydroxy groups of the internal chains in the crystal participate in extensive intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Cellulose is insoluble in water and somewhat resistant to hydrolysis by endo- and exoglucanases because of this highly packed arrangement of the glucan chains. A number of organisms including fungi and bacteria are specialized in depolymerizing cellulose. This involves several types of enzymes including endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and β-glucosidases. Many of these enzymes have a catalytic domain connected to a cellulose-binding module. This module facilitates binding of the enzyme to the insoluble substrate. Some microorganisms also produce copper-dependent oxidases that render crystalline cellulose more susceptible to hydrolysis. Cellulases and other enzymes involved in cellulose hydrolysis often exist as macromolecular complexes referred to as cellulosomes. Improving the effectiveness of cellulosomes is an area of active research, to increase the conversion of plant biomass to fermentable sugar (Chapter 59). Hemicelluloses are branched polysaccharides with a backbone composed of 1-4-linked β-D-pyranosyl residues with an equatorial O-4 (Glcp, Manp, and Xylp).""
 ""We also do not understand how the newly synthesized polymers are assembled into a functional cell wall in the apoplast. Plants produce glycoproteins and proteoglycans that contain oligo- or polysaccharides that are linked to hydroxyproline (Hyp) and serine (Ser). The protein component of these is present in relatively low abundance in the wall. Hyp is formed posttranslationally by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized prolyl hydroxylases and is O-glycosylated in the ER and in the Golgi apparatus. The degree and type of Hyp glycosylation is determined to a large extent by the protein's primary sequence and the arrangement of Hyp residues. Hyp glycosylation is initiated by the addition of an Araf or a Galp residue. Contiguous Hyp residues are arabinosylated, whereas clustered but noncontiguous Hyp residues are galactosylated. Ser residues and occasionally threonine residues may also be O-glycosylated in these proteins. Three classes of structurally distinct plant proteoglycans containing glycosylated Hyp and Ser—the extensins, proline/hydroxyproline-rich proteoglycans, and arabinogalactan proteins—have been identified. Extensins are hydroxyproline-rich proteoglycans with Ser(Hyp)4 repeat sequences and contain between 50% and 60% (w/w) glycan. Most of the carbohydrate exists as oligosaccharides containing one to four Araf residues linked to Hyp together with a small number of single Galp residues α-linked to Ser. The genetic modification of extensin glycosylation levels resulted in the blockage of polarized cell growth in root hairs, underpinning the importance of extensin glycosylation in plant growth and development. The proline/hydroxyproline-rich proteoglycans, which contain from 3% to 70% (w/w) carbohydrate, are distinguished from the extensins by amino acid sequence. Both of these families of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) likely have a structural role in the cell wall. The expression of genes involved in their synthesis is developmentally regulated and is often induced by wounding and fungal attack of plant tissues. Various plant glycopeptide signaling molecules including clavata contain arabinosylated hydroxyproline and have numerous roles in plant growth and development. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) have a glycan content of up to 90% (w/w). Chains of between 30 and 150 monosaccharides are linked to the protein by Galp-O-Ser and Galp-O-Hyp linkages. These chains have a 1-3-linked β-Gal backbone that is extensively substituted at O-6 with side chains of 1-6-linked β-Galp. These side chains are terminated with Araf, GlcAp, and Fucp residues. Some AGPs may contain homogalacturonan, RG-I, and xylan covalently linked to the arabinogalactan (Figure 24.3), thereby forming a protein–hemicellulose–pectin complex referred to as APAP1. The location of this complex in the plant and its biological function remains to be determined. Several AGPs are secreted into the cell wall, whereas others are linked to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Plant GPI anchors contain a phosphoceramide core. The glycan portion of the GPI anchor of pear cell AGP has the sequence α-D-Manp1-2α-D-Manp-1-6-α-D-Manp-1-4-GlcpN-inositol. At least 50% of the Manp attached to the GlcpN (see Chapter 12) is itself substituted at O-4 with a β-Galp, a feature that may be unique to plants. Many functions have been proposed for the AGPs including their participation in signaling, development, cell expansion, cell proliferation, and somatic embryogenesis.""
 'Cellulases and other enzymes involved in cellulose hydrolysis often exist as macromolecular complexes referred to as cellulosomes. Improving the effectiveness of cellulosomes is an area of active research, to increase the conversion of plant biomass to fermentable sugar (Chapter 59). Hemicelluloses are branched polysaccharides with a backbone composed of 1-4-linked β-D-pyranosyl residues with an equatorial O-4 (Glcp, Manp, and Xylp). Xyloglucan, glucurono/arabinoxylan, and glucomannan (Figure 24.1B–E) are included under this chemical definition of hemicelluloses. Hemicelluloses and cellulose have structural and conformational similarities that allow them to form strong, noncovalent associations with one another in the cell wall, although the biological significance of these interactions is still a subject of debate. Xyloglucan and cellulose both have a backbone of 1-4-linked β-D-Glcp residues, but unlike cellulose, xyloglucan contains sidechain substituents. The xyloglucan backbone is highly substituted with α-Xylp substituents at O-6 and in some cases with O-acetyl-substituents (Figure 24.1B). Each Xylp residue may itself be extended by the addition of one or more monosaccharides including β-D-Galp, α-L-Fucp, α-L-Araf, α-L-Arap, β-D-Xylp, β-D-GalpA, and O-acetyl substituents. Twenty-three structurally unique side chains have been identified to date, although only a subset of these are synthesized by a single plant species. Early models of dicot primary walls predicted that xyloglucans acted as tethers between cellulose microfibrils and that controlled enzymatic cleavage or reorganization of xyloglucan by proteins facilitated wall expansion and thus plant cell growth. However, this notion has been challenged by genetic engineering of xyloglucan structures in Arabidopsis plants, which revealed that eliminating xyloglucan entirely from the primary wall has remarkably little effect on overall plant growth and development. In contrast, removing only selected sidechain substituents of xyloglucan is detrimental to plant growth and replacing the sidechains with various glycosyl moieties restores plant growth, independent of the glycosyl moiety added. These results have led to the suggestion that xyloglucan acts as a spacer molecule to keep cellulose microfibrils apart and that pectin has a more important role in controlling wall expansion than previously believed. Arabinoxylan (Figure 24.1D) is the predominant noncellulosic polysaccharide in the type II walls of the grasses, with only small amounts present in dicot primary walls. Its backbone is composed of 1-4-linked β-D-Xylp residues, many of which are substituted at O-3 with α-L-Araf residues. These Araf residues may be further substituted at O-2 with an α-L-Araf or a β-D-Xylp residue. A small number of the backbone residues are substituted at O-2 with α-D-GlcpA and its 4-O-methylated counterpart (MeGlcpA). The presence of 1-3, 1-4-linked β-glucans (also referred to as mixed-linkage glucans) (Figure 24.1F) in the walls of grasses was once considered to be a unique feature of these plants. However, structurally related mixed-linkage β-glucans have also been identified in the walls of Selaginella (lycopod) and Equisetum (horsetails), although the evolutionary relationship between these β-glucans is not known. In grasses, mixed linkage glucan is present mainly in young tissues, which has led to the suggestion that it is a carbohydrate storage molecule as also indicated by its metabolism during plant development. Callose, a polysaccharide composed of 1-3-linked β glucosyl residues, is another β-glucan produced by plants (Figure 24.1G).'
 'The borate ester is formed between the apiosyl residue in side chain A of each RG-II (more...) Schematic structure of the proteoglycan referred to as arabinoxylan pectin arabinogalactan protein1 (APAP1).  Types of N-glycans identified in plants.  Nucleotide sugars are the donors used for the synthesis of glycans, glycoconjugates, and glycosylated secondary metabolites (Chapter 5). In plants, the majority of these activated monosaccharides exist as their nucleotide-diphosphates (e.g., UDP-Glcp or GDP-Manp), although at least one monosaccharide, Kdo, exists as its cytidine monophosphate derivative (CMP-Kdop). Nucleotide sugars are formed from the carbohydrate generated by photosynthesis, from the monosaccharides released by hydrolysis of sucrose and storage carbohydrates, and by recycling monosaccharides from glycans and the cell wall. Nucleotide sugars are also formed by interconverting preexisting activated monosaccharides. To date, 30 different nucleotide sugars and at least 100 genes encoding proteins involved in their formation and interconversion have been identified in plants. As plants are carbohydrate-rich organisms, it is perhaps not surprising that their genomes contain a large number of genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis, metabolism, and modification of glycans and glycoconjugates. These proteins are spread across many enzyme classes in the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database (Table 24.1). Many of these proteins may be involved in the formation and modification of the polysaccharide-rich cell wall. Indeed, the unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri, which is one of the few plants that does not form a cell wall, has a much smaller number of genes predicted to be involved in glycan metabolism. Estimated number of genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis and modification of glycans in plants and humans  The availability of plant lines carrying mutations in specific genes has yielded considerable insight into glycan biosynthesis and function. Arabidopsis thaliana has been widely used as a model dicot as it is easy to grow, has a short life cycle, and its relatively small genome has been sequenced and extensively annotated leading to the generation of chemically induced or transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant collections. These mutants have been vital in studying both the function and substrate specificity of diverse proteins involved in glycan synthesis and for demonstrating the function or redundancy of glycans and/or glycan substituents in the life-cycle of a plant. With the advent of low-cost whole-genome sequencing, the genomes of nearly 100 plant species including rice, maize, barley, poplar, and potato have been assembled (PlantGDB https://www.plantgdb.org). A large amount of transcriptomic data covering most green plant lineages is also available (https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/onekp/). With this sequence and annotation information, combined with gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, plant mutants can be generated to test the functionality of genes related to glycans uniquely present in those plant species. A forward genetic approach, in which Arabidopsis seeds are randomly chemically mutagenized and the resulting plants screened for structural changes in their glycans, has led to the discovery of multiple genes involved in nucleotide sugar interconversion pathways (Chapter 5) as well as plant cell wall–related glycosyltransferases (GTs) (Chapter 6). Reverse genetic approaches, with plants carrying loss-of-function mutations in known genes, have enabled the discovery of GTs involved in the synthesis of primary and secondary cell wall heteroxylans, pectins, N- and O-linked proteoglycans, glycolipids, and glycosylated metabolites. In addition, glycan-modifying enzymes including O-acetyl- and methyltransferases have been identified and characterized. The initial product of photosynthesis, a triose phosphate, is used by plants in multiple ways. Triose phosphate can be converted to sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose (α-D-Glcp-1-2-β-D-Fruf) that is the most abundant soluble carbohydrate in green plants.']","The relationship between Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes and plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis involves the assembly and modification of polysaccharides within the Golgi apparatus before their secretion into the apoplast. These multienzyme complexes play a crucial role in synthesizing various polysaccharides such as xyloglucan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose. The coordinated action of these enzymes within the Golgi apparatus is essential for the proper synthesis and modification of plant cell wall polysaccharides, contributing to the structural integrity and functionality of the cell wall.","The plant Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in cell wall biosynthesis, as it is the location for production of cell wall matrix polysaccharides, modification of protein glycosylation, and assembly/trafficking of cellulos synthase complexes.",0.5,0.9975280902819731,0.8107703315500225,0.008130081300813009,0.99999999998,0.5
How are glycans typically implicated in congenital disorders?,"['CDGs are named by the mutated gene followed by “-CDG” suffix (e.g., PMM2-CDG). Selected disorders are listed in Table 45.1 and all known disorders in Online Appendix 45A. Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification. (For simplicity, disorders affecting multiple pathways are included in disorders (more...) Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans  The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation. The first were identified in the early 1980s based primarily on deficiencies in multiple plasma glycoproteins. The patients were also delayed in reaching growth and developmental milestones and had low muscle tone, incomplete brain development, visual problems, coagulation defects, and endocrine abnormalities. However, many of these symptoms are also seen in patients with other multisystemic genetic syndromes. CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation can be distinguished because they often have abnormal glycosylation of common liver-derived serum proteins containing disialylated, biantennary N-glycans. Serum transferrin is especially convenient because it has two N-glycosylation sites, each normally containing disialylated, biantennary N-glycans. Different glycoforms can be resolved by isoelectric focusing (IEF) or ion-exchange chromatography, but better accuracy and sensitivity is achieved by mass spectrometry (MS) of purified transferrin. This simple test alerts physicians to likely CDG patients without knowing the genetic or molecular basis of the disease. N-glycosylation defects may be divided into two types based on transferrin glycoforms. Type I (CDG-I) patients lack one or both N-glycans because of defects in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) or its transfer to proteins. Type II (CDG-II) patients have incomplete protein-bound glycans because of abnormal processing. The biosynthetic pathways and locations of N-glycan defects are shown in Figure 45.2. Congenital disorders of glycosylation in the N-glycosylation pathway. The figure shows individual steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, glycan transfer to protein, and N-glycan processing similar to Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4. The shuttling (more...) A complete absence of N-glycans is lethal. Therefore, known mutations mostly generate hypomorphic alleles encoding proteins with diminished activity. A deficiency in any of the steps required for the assembly of LLOs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (e.g., nucleotide sugar synthesis or sugar addition catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase) (Chapter 9) produces a structurally incomplete LLO. Because the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) prefers full-sized LLO glycans, this results in hypoglycosylation of multiple glycoproteins. This means that some N-glycan sites are not modified. In recent years, it has been shown that some intermediate LLO structures can also be transferred to proteins, although with much lower efficiency. For example, low amounts of an extended chitobiose glycan were identified in ALG1-CDG, which is deficient in the mannosyltransferase that adds mannose to the chitobiose core. Importantly, many deficiencies in LLO synthesis produce incomplete LLO intermediates. Most of the LLO assembly steps are not easy to assay, but LLO assembly is conserved from yeast to humans, and intermediates that accumulate in CDG patients often correspond to the intermediates seen in mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with known defects in LLO assembly. Some mutant mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells) have been shown to have similar defects (Chapter 49).'

This chapter discusses inherited human diseases that are caused by defects in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (congenital disorders of glycosylation, CDGs). Representative examples are described of genetic defects in the major glycan families and what lessons we can learn from them about glycobiology. Among genetic disorders of glycosylation, those caused by somatic mutations are described in Chapter 46. Disorders affecting the lysosomal degradation of glycans are described in Chapter 44. Although the term “congenital disorders” by definition include those caused by nongenetic, unfavorable in utero conditions, the term “congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)” is now widely used as an equivalent of inherited disorders of glycosylation. Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33) it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found. In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations. Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms. The test was positive in these children, thereby, for the first time, indicating a generic defect in protein N-glycosylation. Lacking further details about glycan structures and the underlying genetic variants, Jaeken decided to call these cases “carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes” (CDGS). Several years later, many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases. To keep the acronym “CDG,” those involved also decided to call them “congenital disorders of glycosylation,” rather than inherited genetic defects in glycosylation. Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis. A few disorders can be treated by the consumption of monosaccharides. The rapid growth in the number of discovered disorders, shown in Figure 45.1, has resulted in an evolution of disease nomenclature. Since 1999, CDGs were defined as genetic defects in N-glycosylation, but now the term is applied to any glycosylation defect. Nowadays, CDGs are categorized in four groups, comprising defects in N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and lipid and GPI-anchor glycosylation and defects that impact multiple glycosylation pathways. CDGs are named by the mutated gene followed by “-CDG” suffix (e.g., PMM2-CDG). Selected disorders are listed in Table 45.1 and all known disorders in Online Appendix 45A. Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification.'
 'The discovery of CDG defects associated with trafficking proteins showed that the abnormal glycosylation linked to these disorders could arise from alterations in Golgi homeostasis and not only from impairment of the enzymes and transporters needed for glycosylation (Figure 45.5). Among the first of these trafficking proteins identified are subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex has multiple roles in trafficking within the Golgi, including the tethering of COPI-coated vesicles and recycling of Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases. COG7-CDG (Table 45.1) was discovered first. Trafficking of multiple glycosyltransferases and nucleotide sugar transporters were disrupted in COG7-CDG. The mutation affects the synthesis of both N- and O-glycans and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Mutations have now been found in all COG subunits except COG3. Mammalian cells deficient in the different COG subunits also show various degrees of altered glycosylation. Golgi homeostasis defects. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are also caused by defects in proteins and transporters that control Golgi homeostasis. These CDGs include members of the vesicle tethering conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, (more...) An unusual disorder called HEMPAS (hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with positive acidified-serum test) leads to abnormal red cell shape and instability (hemolysis) caused by mutations in SEC23B, another intracellular trafficking protein that produces abnormal red blood cell glycans in several pathways. In addition to trafficking proteins, a number of mutations in Golgi-associated ion transporters and vacuolar H+-ATPase subunits have also been shown to disrupt multiple glycosylation pathways, presumably because of an increase in Golgi pH, decrease in metal ion-dependent glycosyltransferase activities, or a more general disruption in Golgi recycling. Mutations in two Golgi manganese transporters, TMEM165 and ZIP8 (SLC39A8), cause CDGs highlighting the role of manganese homeostasis in glycosylation. Expression of the same CDG mutation can have highly variable impacts, even among affected siblings. Explanations based on residual activity from hypomorphic alleles of these “simple Mendelian disorders” are neither simple nor generally satisfying. The variability is often attributed to “genetic background.” A knockout mutation may be lethal in one highly inbred mouse strain, but not in another because compensatory pathways exist in the latter. Dietary and environmental impacts are substantial as seen in MPI-CDG patients treated by oral mannose therapy. Multiple simultaneous or sequential environmental insults may impinge on borderline genetic insufficiencies to produce overt disease. A major question for future investigations is how CDG defects cause pathology. Addressing this challenge will require the implementation of analytical approaches like glycomics and glycoproteomics and of model systems that allow identification of sensitive pathways and glycoproteins in affected tissues. In an interesting twist, it is possible to have diseases caused by “excessive” glycosylation. For example, Marfan syndrome results from mutations in fibrillin1 (FBN1) and one of these creates an N-glycosylation site that disrupts multimeric assembly of FBN1. This may not be an isolated case. A survey of nearly 600 known pathological mutations in proteins traveling the ER–Golgi pathway showed that 13% of them create novel glycosylation sites. This is far greater than predicted by random missense mutations and may mean that hyperglycosylation leads to a new class of CDGs.

 'Proteinases such as cathepsins are estimated to be ∼1 mm; glycosidases are probably present at much lower concentrations. About 50 known inherited diseases impair lysosomal degradation of macromolecules. Although each one is rare, together their occurrence is about one in every 5000 to 10,000 births. Loss of a single lysosomal hydrolase leads to the accumulation of its substrate as undegraded fragments in tissues and the appearance of related fragments in urine. Many of the human disorders have animal models. Tables 44.1, 44.2, and 44.3 show some of the major clinical symptoms of diseases associated with the degradation of three classes of glycans. Many of the diseases share overlapping symptoms, and yet each disease has unique clinical features that allow it to be diagnosed. Many of the diseases also present with a range of severities. Usually, an infantile onset is the most severe, and the juvenile or adult onsets have milder symptoms. The later-onset forms may even affect organ systems distinct from those affected by early-onset forms. Hundreds of mutations have been mapped in the different disorders. The severity usually depends on the combination of mutated alleles. Predicting the disease severity (prognosis) from the specific mutation is generally difficult. Complete absence of a lysosomal hydrolase is uniformly severe. Hypomorphic alleles have variable residual glycosidase activity making their prognosis difficult. If there is a defect on mannose 6-phosphate–mediated targeting of lysosomal hydrolases, it will also lead to a lysosomal storage disease such as I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) or pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis III) (Chapter 33). Defects in glycoprotein degradation—the glycoproteinoses  Defects in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation—the mucopolysaccharidoses  Defects in glycolipid degradation  It is not clear whether accumulating different types of undegraded glycans leads to the different symptoms characteristic of each disease. There is no evidence that the stored material causes lysosomes to burst and spew their contents into the cytoplasm. However, increased lysosomal exocytosis or fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane has been noted for some disorders. Many lysosomal disorders have defects in autophagy. This can result in impaired clearance of damaged organelles like mitochondria. The pathology likely depends on the cell type and the cellular balance of synthesis and turnover rates. For instance, dermatan sulfate (DS), a GAG (Chapter 17), predominates in connective tissue, which might explain the bone, joint, and skin problems in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I, II, VI, and VII. Keratan sulfate (KS), another GAG, is present in cartilage; therefore, MPS IV is largely a skeletal disease. Gangliosides (Chapter 11) are most abundant in neurons; therefore, gangliosidoses are predominantly brain disorders. The importance of glycogen for muscle explains the impact of Pompe disease, a lysosomal disease caused by a mutation of GAA gene encoding α-glucosidase important for glycogen degradation, on the heart and diaphragm, leading to rapid lethality in that disease. Secondary storage of glycans is a common finding in many of these disorders, highlighted by the accumulation of glycolipids in the cholesterol storage disease, Niemann–Pick type C and in several disorders with GAG storage. Given the balance between synthesis and degradation of multiple glycans, reducing synthesis somewhat by the use of an inhibitor may help to retard the accumulation of primary or secondary storage and reduce the pathology of some diseases. The great majority of N- and O-glycans reaching the lysosome contain only six sugars linked in one or two anomeric configurations: β-N-acetylglucosamine (βGlcNAc), α/β-N-acetylgalactosamine (α/βGalNAc), α/β-galactose (α/βGal), α/β-mannose (α/βMan), α-fucose (αFuc), and α-sialic acid (αSia).'
 ""Discovery of defects in Golgi organization and homeostasis, in ER chaperones such as COSMC or EDEM, and in ER quality control (such as EDEM-3-CDG) have broadened the perspective. A new defect in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) continuum (Chapter 39) is caused by mutations in NGLY1, an enzyme that cleaves N-glycans from misfolded glycoproteins transported into the cytoplasm before their proteasomal degradation (Table 45.1). NGLY1 defects do not appear to induce the ERAD pathway, accumulate undegraded glycoproteins in vesicles, or trigger autophagy. It is unclear how these defects cause symptoms such as developmental delay, movement disorder, seizures, and a curious lack of tear production, but their clinical similarity to other CDGs emphasizes that glycosylation defects cannot simply be divided into “synthesis” or “degradation.” Mutations altering O-Man glycans (Chapter 13), primarily on α-dystroglycan (α-DG), cause a range of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) termed dystroglycanopathies (Figure 45.3). α-DG at the sarcolemma links skeletal muscle cells to laminin in the extracellular matrix. A disruption of this linkage results in muscular dystrophy. Similarly, defective interaction of α-DG with other protein ligands in eye and brain results in a broad clinical spectrum of dystroglycanopathies, ranging from very severe, and often lethal, musculo-oculo-encephalopathies, such as Walker–Warburg syndrome (WWS), muscle–eye–brain disease (MEB), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), to milder forms of isolated limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in adults. Genetic analysis of these disorders has been indispensable for discovering α-DG's functional glycans and their biosynthesis. The complex pathway is presented in Figure 45.3 and Chapter 13. The pathway is initiated in the ER by the transfer of mannose to Ser/Thr of α-DG via the protein O-mannosyltransferase complex POMT1/POMT2 (Table 45.1). In the Golgi, a polymer glycan (matriglycan) is generated, recognized by several diagnostic monoclonal antibodies and necessary for the binding of laminin and other molecules to α-DG. An unusual feature on one subset of O-Man glycans is the existence of a Man-6-P generated by the kinase POMK. The Man-6-P-containing Core M3 glycan consists of Man-6-P, GlcNAc (transferred by POMGNT2), and GalNAc (transferred by B3GALNT2). The trisaccharide core is extended by two units of ribitol-5-phosphate sequentially transferred by FKTN (fukutin) and FKRP (fukutin-related protein) from CDP-ribitol, which is generated by CRPPA. This “core” glycan is elongated by an alternating disaccharide (β1-3Xylα1-3GlcA) to form matriglycan. O-Man glycan biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthetic pathways of representative O-Man glycans are shown. Enzymes whose defects cause a disorder are indicated in red. Three main groups are identified: cores M1–M3. All O-Man glycans are initiated (more...) O-Man glycans can also play a traitorous role, because they are receptor molecules for Lassa virus entry into cells. This feature was cleverly exploited to screen libraries and identify genes required for virus entry. The method correctly identified all previously known WWS-causing genes and predicted new culprits.""]","Glycans are typically implicated in congenital disorders through defects in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, leading to a range of genetic disorders known as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). These disorders can affect various glycosylation pathways, impacting N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, lipid, and GPI-anchor glycosylation. Mutations in genes involved in glycan biosynthesis can result in abnormal glycosylation patterns, affecting multiple organ systems and leading to a variety of clinical symptoms. Defects in proteins and transporters that control Golgi homeostasis, as well as alterations in ER chaperones and quality control mechanisms, can also contribute to glycosylation-related disorders. Additionally, mutations altering specific glycans, such as O-Man glycans, have been linked to conditions like congenital muscular dystrophies.","Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs (congenital disorders of glycosylation) are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis.",1.0,0.7436493797602823,0.8655981800794759,0.006944444444444444,0.999999999975,1.0
How are glycans typically implicated in cancer?,"['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.47 Susan L. Bellis, Celso A. Reis, Ajit Varki, Reiji Kannagi, and Pamela Stanley. Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression. This chapter discusses glycan biosynthetic pathways that are altered in cancer cells; correlations between altered glycosylation, diagnosis, and clinical prognosis; the genetic bases of some of these changes; and the functional role of glycans in cancer biology and pathogenesis. The earliest evidence of altered glycosylation as a hallmark of cancer was that some plant lectins show enhanced binding and agglutination of tumor cells. Next, it was found that transformation of cultured cells is frequently accompanied by a general increase in the size of glycopeptides of cell-surface glycoproteins. With the advent of monoclonal antibody technology, many “tumor-specific” antibodies directed against glycan epitopes were found. In many instances, these epitopes represented “oncofetal antigens”—that is, glycan epitopes expressed on tumor cells and embryonic tissues. Like normal cells during embryogenesis, tumor cells also undergo rapid growth and invade tissues. Correlations between certain types of altered glycosylation and the prognosis of tumor-bearing animals or patients increased interest in glycan changes. In vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies have now supported the conclusion that glycan changes are critical to several aspects of tumor cell behavior. Glycan changes in malignant cells take a variety of forms: loss of expression or excessive expression of certain glycans, increased expression of incomplete or truncated glycans, and, less commonly, the appearance of novel glycans. However, this is not simply the random consequence of disordered biosynthesis in tumor cells. It is striking that a very limited subset of changes are correlated with malignant transformation and tumor progression, highlighting a potential functional role in tumor biology. Given that cancer is a “microevolutionary” process in which only the fittest cells survive, and that tumors are under immune surveillance pressure, it is likely that these specific glycan changes are selected for during tumor progression. Classic reports of increased size of tumor cell glycopeptides have now been partly explained by an increase in β1-6 branching of N-glycans (Figure 47.1), resulting from enhanced expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V, MGAT5) (Chapter 9). Increased transcription of the MGAT5 gene is induced by various oncogenic transcription factors, as well as viral- and chemical-induced carcinogenesis. Cells with up-regulated MGAT5 show an increased frequency of metastasis in mice, and spontaneous revertants lacking MGAT5 lose the metastatic phenotype. Overexpression of MGAT5 in cultured cells causes a transformed phenotype, whereas Mgat5-deficient mice show a striking reduction in the growth and metastasis of mammary tumors induced by a viral oncogene. Increased expression of MGAT4 to form a β1-4 branched tetra-antennary N-glycan also enhances tumor progression. Possible mechanisms by which increased N-glycan branching and extension enhances progression include lattice formation via galectin binding to poly-N-acetyllactosamines (LacNAc) leading to prolonged growth factor signaling, and the generation of sialyl-Lewis x (SLex) tetrasaccharides recognized by selectins because of increased outer-chain sialylation and fucosylation (Figure 47.1). Increased expression of FUT8 that transfers the core Fuc to N-glycans (Figure 47.1) is also observed in solid tumors and promotes tumor progression in lung cancer and melanoma.'
 'In addition, the core-fucosylated α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) can be a sensitive and specific circulating biomarker for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Truncated O-GalNAc glycans Tn, STn, and T (Figure 47.2) are good markers for the detection of cancer in tumor sections. Furthermore, the detection of specific glycoproteins bearing these truncated O-glycans, such as cancer-specific MUC16 glycoforms, enhances the specificity of diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. In addition, specific glycoproteins modified with truncated glycans, including Tn and STn, have been used as targets to generate glycopeptide-specific antibodies that have shown potential utility in clinical trials. Other important biomarkers include SLex-related glycans, which are used in lung and breast cancer to monitor residual disease after surgery. In recent years, there has been a major interest in glycomic profiling of serum and other body fluid glycoproteins, in addition to glycoproteins in extracellular vesicles. Classic findings of glycan-specific antibodies associated with cancer, such as the antibodies against the nonhuman Sia, Neu5Gc, are also being reinvestigated. Another potential advance lies in improving the specificity of known cancer biomarkers by defining glycoprotein glycoforms uniquely expressed by cancer cells (e.g., prostate-specific antigen). In tandem with their roles as biomarkers, glycans are important targets for cancer therapeutics. A monoclonal antibody against GD2 has been U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma, and other GD2-targeting antibodies, as well as CAR-T cells, are in clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma, glioma, melanoma, and other cancers. Vaccines against GD2 are also being explored. The Tn-bearing form of MUC1 is another promising target, with both therapeutic antibodies and CAR-T cells against Tn-MUC1 under active investigation. Additionally, several selectin inhibitors are showing efficacy in clinical trials, including E-selectin-targeting glycomimetic agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and acute myelogenous leukemia. Heparin has long been known to have potent antitumor effects, in part because of its ability to block P- and L-selectin binding to tumor and/or host ligands (Chapter 34). However, heparin therapy for cancer treatment can be limited by its anticoagulant properties, and thus low-molecular-weight heparins or heparinoids that lack such activity may be needed. Low-molecular-weight heparins may also inhibit tumor progression by blocking heparanase activity or by interfering with constitutive HS activities. Other heparanase inhibitors such as the sulfated phosphomannopentaose PI-88, which inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis, may work by blocking selectins or competitively inhibiting HS binding and function. Low-molecular-weight oligosaccharides of hyaluronan could also be useful therapeutically, because they inhibit the pro-oncogenic influences of constitutive polymeric hyaluronan, especially drug resistance and signaling events induced by hyaluronan–CD44 interaction. Disaccharides that can enter the cell and act as decoys to divert glycosylation pathways are also showing promise (Chapter 55). Recently, there has been growing interest in targeting glycan-dependent molecular interactions to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition. N-glycosylation is important for stabilization of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule, as well as recognition by PD-1. Thus, therapeutic interference with PD-L1 glycosylation could provide a mechanism for hindering the activation of PD-1 on immune cells. The sialoglycan–Siglec interaction represents another critical immune checkpoint, and function-blocking antibodies against select Siglecs have entered clinical trials. Additionally, methods are being developed to block or ablate tumor cell Sia ligands for Siglecs via administration of sialic acid mimetics or the targeted delivery of sialidases to tumor cell surfaces. Alternatively, Siglecs expressed by hematopoietic cancer cells (e.g., Siglec 2) can serve as recognition molecules for CAR-T cell immunotherapy or delivery of cytotoxic drugs.'
 ""Because the primary dietary source of Neu5Gc is red meat, this may help explain the increased cancer risk associated with its consumption. SLex and SLea epitopes (Chapter 14) were first identified as tumor antigens on glycosphingolipids. Expression of these antigens by epithelial carcinomas correlates with metastatic potential in mice and with tumor progression, metastatic spread, and poor prognosis in humans. SLex and SLea epitopes on glycoprotein ligands are key recognition determinants of the selectins (Chapter 34). Indeed, selectin ligands are expressed on carcinoma cells, and mucin-like tumor antigens carrying SLex and SLea are found in the blood of carcinoma patients (Figure 47.4). Transgenic overexpression of E-selectin in mouse liver causes carcinoma cells that would normally metastasize to the lung to be redirected toward colonization of the liver, supporting the concept that SLe/selectin interactions are important mediators of metastasis. Furthermore, metastasis is attenuated in mice lacking P-selectin or L-selectin or by administering heparin, which blocks binding by these selectins. Selectin interactions also help explain the classic observation that cancer cells entering the bloodstream form thromboemboli with platelets and leukocytes, which facilitate arrest in the vasculature, assist extravasation through the endothelium, and help in evasion of the immune system. Similar interactions involving soluble cancer mucins may contribute to hypercoagulability (Trousseau's syndrome), a condition responsive to heparin treatment. Because of the prominent role of selectins in cancer progression, these receptors are major therapeutic targets (see below). Certain sialyl-Lewis-related structures may also influence carcinoma progression by interacting with Siglecs, which generally have immunosuppressive functions. For example, disialyl-Lea and sialyl-6-sulfo-Lex structures may protect against early carcinogenic events by binding to Siglec-7 on macrophages. This interaction suppresses macrophage production of the pro-oncogenic inflammatory mediator, Cox2, thereby exerting an anti-oncogenic function. However, during cancer development, many other sialylated glycan ligands for Siglecs are increased, and these bind to inhibitory Siglecs on various immune cell populations to induce immunosuppression and facilitate tumor progression. In normal physiology platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells interact via selectins and selectin ligands. In invasive carcinoma, interactions that promote invasion occur between tumor cells expressing selectin ligands and selectins on endothelial (more...) Loss of AB blood group expression in the context of carcinoma (accompanied by exposure of underlying H and Ley epitopes) (Chapter 14) is associated with poor prognosis. The Sda (or Cad) antigen, a blood group glycan abundantly expressed in the colon, is lost in colon carcinoma. Sulfation of the C-3 position of terminal Gal residues is also reduced in cancers. Sialyl-6-sulfo-Lewis x and disialyl-Lewis a, expressed on colonic epithelial cells, are reduced in colon cancer cells. These changes may reflect the enhanced production of SLex and SLea in cancers. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, epigenetic mechanisms for suppression of gene transcription commonly observed in cancers, are proposed to underlie these glycan alterations. There are also rare instances in which a tumor may present a “forbidden” blood group structure (i.e., expression of a B blood group antigen in an A-positive patient) (Chapter 14). Regardless of the underlying mechanism, tumor regression has been noted in a few such cases, presumably mediated by the naturally occurring endogenous antibodies directed against the foreign structure. Many “tumor-specific” monoclonal antibodies raised against cancer cells recognize the glycan portion of glycosphingolipids. Some glycolipids are highly enriched in specific cancers (e.g., Gb3/CD77 in Burkitt's lymphoma and GM3, GD2, and GD3 in melanomas) (Figure 47.3). Several types of tumors (particularly melanoma and neuroblastoma) are characterized by the synthesis of very high levels of gangliosides (Chapter 11).""
 ""Many “tumor-specific” monoclonal antibodies raised against cancer cells recognize the glycan portion of glycosphingolipids. Some glycolipids are highly enriched in specific cancers (e.g., Gb3/CD77 in Burkitt's lymphoma and GM3, GD2, and GD3 in melanomas) (Figure 47.3). Several types of tumors (particularly melanoma and neuroblastoma) are characterized by the synthesis of very high levels of gangliosides (Chapter 11). Some of these (e.g., GD2) are not normally found at high levels in extraneural tissues and are therefore targets for both passive immunotherapy (monoclonal antibody infusion) and active immunotherapy (immunization with purified glycolipids). In some cases, gangliosides are also major carriers of modified Sias (Figure 47.3). Cell culture studies suggest that some gangliosides promote tumor cell growth and invasion. As a principal constituent of lipid raft membrane microdomains, gangliosides modulate cell signaling by numerous receptors. Additionally, gangliosides shed by some tumors appear to have immunosuppressive effects. A complete loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins is seen in some cases of malignant and premalignant states involving the hematopoietic system. This results from acquired mutations in hematopoietic stem cells in the PIGA gene (required for an early step in GPI-anchor biosynthesis [Chapter 12]). Conversely, some GPI-anchored proteins, such as members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, like CEACAM5 (CEA), are overexpressed in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, and female reproductive system, among others. Members of the CEACAM family have been implicated in tumor biology via interference with the integrin signaling pathway. Many classes of malignant tumors express high levels of hyaluronan, a large negatively charged polysaccharide composed of the repeating disaccharide unit [GlcAβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4]n (Chapter 16). In carcinomas, hyaluronan is localized near the tumor cell surface, and is also enriched in tumor-associated stroma. In normal tissues, hyaluronan serves at least three functions, which may also contribute to tumor progression. First, it increases tissue hydration, facilitating cell movement through tissues. Second, it is intrinsic to the assembly of extracellular matrices through specific interactions with other macromolecules, and thus it participates in tumor cell–matrix interactions that facilitate or inhibit tumor cell survival and invasion. Finally, hyaluronan interacts with several types of cell-surface receptors, especially CD44, which mediate or modify cell signaling pathways. These interactions, notably with alternatively spliced isoforms of CD44 that are elevated in most cancer cells, are often crucial to tumor malignancy and are a current target for novel therapies. In normal adult tissues, hyaluronan appears to be relatively inert with respect to cell signaling and behavior. However, during embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and in various pathologies, hyaluronan-CD44 signaling becomes activated, possibly because of limited cleavage of hyaluronan by hyaluronidases. The consequences of this signaling are dramatic because they promote cell proliferation, survival, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion, which are key elements of the malignant phenotype (Figure 47.5). Hyaluronan–CD44 interactions are required for the constitutive activation of some oncogenes, especially receptor tyrosine kinases such as ERBB2, which is amplified or mutated in numerous carcinomas. Accordingly, hyaluronan–CD44 interaction promotes downstream intracellular pathways that are also hallmarks of cancer, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Antagonists of hyaluronan–CD44 interaction cause inactivation of these pathways in malignant cells in culture and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in animal models. Hyaluronan–CD44 interaction also stimulates multidrug resistance, and antagonists sensitize resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.""
 'Increased expression of FUT8 that transfers the core Fuc to N-glycans (Figure 47.1) is also observed in solid tumors and promotes tumor progression in lung cancer and melanoma. The expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III, MGAT3) that catalyzes the transfer of β1-4GlcNAc to Man on N-glycans to form the bisecting GlcNAc (Figure 47.1) is up-regulated in rat hepatomas and mouse mammary tumors. However, in this case, tumor progression is suppressed by the presence of N-glycans with the bisecting GlcNAc. Mice lacking MGAT3 show increased mammary tumors and lung metastases, whereas high MGAT3 expression correlates with better relapse-free survival in human breast cancer. However, liver tumors are reduced in mice lacking MGAT3, and MGAT3 activity endows ovarian cancer cells with cancer stem cell features. Thus, the effects of MGAT3 on cancer progression depend on tissue context. N-Glycans increase in size on neoplastic transformation of cells, in part because of increased MGAT4 and MGAT5 activity, which catalyzes GlcNAc branching of N-glycans. This may lead to increased numbers of LacNAc units, which can also be sialylated and (more...) Mucins are large glycoproteins rich in O-GalNAc glycans on Ser or Thr in tandem repeat regions (Chapter 10). In normal polarized epithelium, mucins are expressed in the apical membrane, facing the lumen of a hollow organ, and soluble mucins are secreted exclusively into the lumen. Loss of adhesion junctions and topology in malignant epithelial cells destroys polarization, allowing mucins to enter the extracellular space and the blood. Loss of polarization and overexpression of mucins displaying aberrant glycosylation has made these glycoproteins a major source of biomarkers with clinical applications. The rod-like structure and negative charge of mucins are thought to repel intercellular interactions and sterically inhibit adhesion molecules such as cadherins and integrins from carrying out their functions. Thus, mucins may act as “antiadhesins” to promote displacement of a cell from the primary tumor during the initiation of metastasis. Tumor mucins bearing selectin ligands facilitate several aspects of cancer progression (see below). Mucins might also interfere with immune cell recognition and block or mask presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. A hallmark feature of carcinomas is the aberrant synthesis of incomplete O-glycans, present in mucins and other glycoproteins, typified by the Tn and T antigens and their sialylated glycoforms, sialyl-Tn (STn) and sialyl-T (ST) (Figure 47.2). Secreted glycoproteins expressing STn often appear in the bloodstream of patients with cancer. Because these glycans occur infrequently in normal tissues, they serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Truncated O-glycans evoke immune responses in the patient, and accordingly, vaccines against these glycans have been developed. As an alternative, incomplete O-glycans can serve as targets for a variety of therapeutic antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The appearance of excessive Tn and STn on tumor cells correlates in some instances with silencing of the COSMC gene (C1GALT1C1). The β1-3 galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) that synthesizes Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr requires the chaperone C1GALT1C1 for activity. The gene for C1GALT1C1 is on the X chromosome, thus a single mutation may be sufficient to eliminate expression. In other instances, STn accumulation results from overexpression of the sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC1 (Figure 47.2). The expression of Tn and STn can enhance tumorigenic and invasive properties, and promote immunosuppression.']","Glycans are typically implicated in cancer through altered glycosylation patterns that serve as diagnostic markers, biomarkers for tumor progression, and functional roles in cancer biology and pathogenesis. These alterations include changes in glycan biosynthetic pathways, correlations between specific glycan structures and tumor prognosis, and the functional impact of glycans on various aspects of tumor cell behavior. Additionally, glycans are important targets for cancer therapeutics, with specific glycan structures being utilized for monoclonal antibody therapies, CAR-T cell treatments, and selectin inhibitors in clinical trials.

Describe the basic structure of biantennary glycans,"['Branching is a prime characteristic of many glycans found on mammalian cell surfaces. Glycans representing two major types of eukaryotic protein glycosylation are shown in Figure 3.1. An N-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the side-chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue that is a part of a consensus peptide sequence NX(S/T). An O-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the terminal oxygen of a serine or threonine residue. N-Glycans contain a core composed of three mannose residues and two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Manα1-6[Manα1-3]Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-N-Asn). The depicted glycan is a biantennary glycan with branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain. However, more complex structures exist with three and four branches. Details of the synthesis and biological importance of these glycans are presented in Chapter 9. The depicted O-glycan contains a typical core structure (one of four common cores) that begins at the reducing end with an N-acetylgalactosamine α-linked to a serine or threonine (GlcNAcβ1-6[Galβ1-3]GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). It begins as a biantennary structure but can be further extended toward the nonreducing end to form more complex structures. The synthesis and biological importance of O-glycans are described in Chapters 10 (O-GalNAc) and 19 (O-GlcNAc). Examples of branched structures in N- and O-linked glycans.  Both glycans depicted are terminated with a sialic acid (often Neu5Ac in humans) at their nonreducing end. Sialylation is characteristic of mammalian glycans and important for immune response. In protein–glycan interactions, not only are particular residues recognized, but often their position in a branching structure is recognized as well. An interesting example is the interaction of the enzyme that adds the 2-6-linked sialic acids to the termini of N-glycans. It has a high preference for adding to the 1-3-linked branch (by more than an order of magnitude) despite the fact that the residues on both branches are identical back to the mannose at the branch point (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα-). This may give some indication of the extent to which branching plays a role in recognition processes. Unique among mammals are free oligosaccharides present in milk. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are highly abundant in breast milk. Unlike most glycans that are conjugated to either proteins or lipids, HMOs are unconjugated in their native states. Thus, they contain a reactive aldehyde on the reducing end. HMOs decrease during lactation but are often even more abundant than proteins. Although the precise details of their synthesis are still not well known, HMO structures are more similar to glycans on glycolipids and O-glycans on proteins. The structures are based on a lactose core (Galβ1-4Glc) and extend either in branched or linear forms. Extensions are composed primarily of glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acids. As molecules, they are generally small, with the majority of the structures in the range of three to six monosaccharides; however, structures with more than 20 monosaccharides have been observed. HMO structures have been characterized by advanced glycomic analytical tools such as liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (see Chapter 50). Hundreds of structures have been observed, although one mother typically produces about 100 structures. There are two HMO phenotypes (from four genotypes) that determine the types of structures in the milk. Mothers who secrete their blood type or the Lewis b epitope are termed secretors. Secretors produce structures that contain α1-2-linked fucose.'
 'The ring form of a monosaccharide generates a chiral anomeric center at C-1 for aldo sugars or at C-2 for keto sugars (for details, see Chapter 2). A glycosidic linkage involves the attachment of a monosaccharide to another residue, typically via the hydroxyl group of this anomeric center, generating α-linkages or β-linkages that are defined based on the relationship of the glycosidic oxygen to the anomeric carbon and ring (Chapter 2). These two linkage types confer very different structural properties and biological functions on sequences that are otherwise identical in composition, as classically illustrated by the differences between starch and cellulose (both are homopolymers of glucose, the former largely α1-4-linked and the latter β1-4-linked throughout). A glycoconjugate is a compound in which one or more monosaccharide or oligosaccharide units (the glycone) are covalently linked to a noncarbohydrate moiety (the aglycone). An oligosaccharide that is not attached to an aglycone possesses the reducing power of the aldehyde or ketone in its terminal monosaccharide component, with the exception of oligosaccharides in which the sugars are linked together at their reducing ends, as in derivatives of sucrose or trehalose. The end of a glycan exposing the aldehyde or ketone group is therefore named the reducing terminus or reducing end, terms that tend to be used even when the sugar chain is attached to an aglycone and has thus lost its reducing power. Correspondingly, the opposite end of the chain tends to be called the nonreducing end (note the analogy to the amino and carboxyl ends of proteins, or the 5′ and 3′ ends of DNA and RNA). Open-chain and ring forms of glucose. Changes in the orientation of hydroxyl groups around specific carbon atoms generate new molecules that have a distinct biology and biochemistry (e.g., galactose is the C-4 epimer of glucose). In the ring form, glucose (more...) In naturally occurring glycoconjugates, the portion of the molecule comprising the glycans can vary greatly in contribution to its overall size. In many cases, the glycans comprise a substantial portion of the mass of glycoconjugates (for a typical example, see Figure 1.3). For this reason, the surfaces of all types of cells in nature (which are heavily decorated with different kinds of glycoconjugates) are effectively covered with a dense array of sugars, the so-called ""glycocalyx."" This cell-surface structure was observed many years ago by electron microscopists as a negatively charged coat external to the cell surface membrane in bacteria, which could be stained with ruthenium red and in animal cells in which the anionic coat could be decorated with polycationic reagents (Figure 1.4.) Evidence that the “glycocalyx” was enriched in sugars, including protein-bound sialic acid in animal cells, first came from studies of the effect of proteolytic enzymes on the behavior of erythrocytes in cell electrophoresis along with studies of the nature of viral and plant lectin binding sites on this cell type. The density of glycans in the glycocalyx can be remarkably high. For example, it has been calculated that the concentration of sialic acids in the glycocalyx of a typical human B lymphocyte may be >100 mm.

 'In addition, the action of MAN1B1, MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 can all be blocked experimentally by the inhibitors, deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine, resulting in Man8-9GlcNAc2 on mature glycoproteins. Most mature glycoproteins have some oligomannose N-glycans that are not processed in the cis-Golgi. Biosynthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans (Figure 9.1) is initiated in the medial-Golgi by the action of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase called GlcNAc-TI (MGAT1), which adds a GlcNAc residue to the C-2 of the α1-3Man in the core of Man5GlcNAc2 (Figure 9.4). Subsequently, the majority of N-glycans are trimmed by α-mannosidase II enzymes (MAN2A1 or MAN2A2) in the medial-Golgi, which remove the terminal α1-3Man and α1-6Man residues from GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 to form GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2. It is important to note that α-mannosidase II cannot trim Man5GlcNAc2 unless it has been acted on by MGAT1. Once both Man residues are removed, a second GlcNAc is added to the C-2 of the α1-6Man in the N-glycan core by the action of GlcNAc-TII (MGAT2) to yield the precursor for all biantennary, complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans are formed if the GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 glycan produced by MGAT1 is not acted on by α-mannosidase II. Incomplete action of α-mannosidase II can result in GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc2 hybrids. Small oligomannose N-glycans have been found in relatively large amounts in invertebrates and plants. These Man3–4GlcNAc2 N-glycans (paucimannose N-glycans) are formed from GlcNAcMan3–4GlcNAc2 following removal of the peripheral GlcNAc by a Golgi hexosaminidase that acts after α-mannosidase II (Chapters 24 and 26). Paucimannose glycans are also found in mammals, and can be elevated in cancer, inflammation, and stem cell development. The complex N-glycan shown in the medial-Golgi of Figure 9.4 has two antennae or branches initiated by the addition of two GlcNAc residues. Additional branches can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-3Man by GlcNAc-TIV (MGAT4A, MGAT4B, MGAT4C) and at C-6 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TV (MGAT5) to yield tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans (Figure 9.5). MGAT5B or GlcNAc-TIX catalyzes the same reaction but preferentially on O-mannose glycans in brain. Another branch, found in birds and fish, can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TVI (MGAT6; Figure 9.5). Genes related to GlcNAc-TVI exist in mammalian genomes (MGAT4C). Complex and hybrid N-glycans may also carry a “bisecting” GlcNAc residue that is attached to the β-Man of the core by GlcNAc-TIII (MGAT3) (Figure 9.5). A bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary N-glycan is shown in Figure 9.5, and it may be present in all of the more highly branched N-glycans. However, it is not usually extended.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.3 Carlito B. Lebrilla, Jian Liu, Göran Widmalm, and James H. Prestegard. This chapter discusses the diversity in structure and properties that results when multiple monosaccharides (Chapter 2) are linked together to form oligosaccharides and polysaccharides (the latter comprising much of the biomass on the planet). Some examples of the more complex polymeric assemblies that occur in nature are presented, and how these remarkable structures are generated is discussed. Except in their roles as sources of energy for living organisms, sugars seldom occur in nature as monosaccharides. Instead, they serve as building blocks for more complex molecules. In the most common process, an initial sugar is linked to an aglycone (often a lipid or a protein) and this sugar is further elaborated by covalently joining other sugars through glycosidic linkages (Chapter 2) between the anomeric carbon of the sugar being added and a hydroxyl oxygen of an existing sugar. The resulting glycans are called oligosaccharides (usually less than a dozen monosaccharides) or polysaccharides (usually more than a dozen monosaccharides). The latter are usually built on a core of repeating subunits of linked monosaccharides. The way in which assembly of both oligosaccharides and polysaccharides occurs produces structures of enormous diversity and widely varying properties. This allows glycans to fill roles that vary from cell-surface interactions with proteins important in differentiation, recognition, and proliferation of cells, to interactions with other glycans that generate the mechanical properties of plant and microbial cell walls. Diverse structures can be created by simply linking different monosaccharides through glycosidic bonds, to make oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. The diversity arises not only from the choice of sugars but also from the way they are linked. If there were just one way to link monosaccharides, the choice among the dozen or so commonly used sugars would make the resulting polysaccharides more diverse than polynucleotides (four nucleotide choices for DNA and RNA) but less diverse than polypeptides (20 amino acid choices for mammalian proteins). However, the possibility of making glycosidic bonds between the anomeric carbon of one sugar and any one of the unmodified hydroxyl groups in another mono- or oligosaccharide adds to the diversity, by allowing not only more linear products, but also branched products in which more than one hydroxyl group on a given sugar is used to make glycosidic bonds. In addition, each anomeric carbon is a stereogenic center, and therefore each glycosidic linkage can be constructed having either the α- or β-configuration. Building an oligosaccharide, such as a tetrasaccharide (four sugars) with an unlinked reducing end, using only a single sugar in one ring form, such as glucopyranose, the authors could construct 1792 distinct structures. Of course, not all theoretically possible molecules are produced in nature because of the lack of enzymes to build them, but many are made contributing to the wide range of functional properties that allow carbohydrates to play many important roles. Branching is a prime characteristic of many glycans found on mammalian cell surfaces. Glycans representing two major types of eukaryotic protein glycosylation are shown in Figure 3.1. An N-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the side-chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue that is a part of a consensus peptide sequence NX(S/T). An O-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the terminal oxygen of a serine or threonine residue.'

Further sugar additions convert the limited repertoire of hybrid and branched N-glycans into an extensive array of mature, complex N-glycans comprising (1) sugar additions to the N-glycan core, (2) elongation of branching GlcNAc residues by sugar additions, and (3) “capping” or “decoration” of elongated branches. The major core modification in vertebrate N-glycans is the addition of α1-6Fuc to the Asn-linked GlcNAc in the N-glycan core (Figure 9.5). The α1-6 fucosyltransferase (FUT8) usually requires the prior action of MGAT1 (Figure 9.4). In invertebrate glycoproteins, both core GlcNAc residues may receive a Fuc in an α1–3 and/or α1-6 linkage (Chapters 25 and 26). In plants, Fuc is transferred to the Asn-linked GlcNAc only in α1-3 linkage (Chapter 24). Also, in plant and helminth glycoproteins, the addition of β1-2Xyl to the β-Man of the core is common. This xylosyltransferase also requires the prior action of MGAT1. Xylose has not been detected in vertebrate N-glycans. The majority of complex and hybrid N-glycans have extended branches that are made by the addition of Gal to the initiating GlcNAc to produce the ubiquitous building block Galβ1-4GlcNAc, referred to as a type-2 N-acetyllactosamine or “LacNAc” sequence (Figure 9.6). The sequential addition of LacNAc disaccharides gives tandem repeats termed poly-LacNAc. In some glycoproteins, β-linked GalNAc is added to GlcNAc instead of Gal, yielding antennae with a GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc) extension (Chapter 14). Typical complex N-glycans found on mature glycoproteins. A LacNAc unit (bracketed) on any branch may be repeated many times.  The most important “capping” reactions involve the addition of Sia, Fuc, Gal, GlcNAc, and sulfate to complex N-glycan branches. Capping sugars are most commonly α-linked and therefore protrude away from the β-linked poly-LacNAc branches, thus facilitating the presentation of terminal sugars to lectins and antibodies. Many of these structures are shared by N- and O-glycans and by glycolipids (Chapter 14). Terminal sialic acids can have further chemical modifications (e.g., O-acetylation) (Chapter 15). The various reactions described above potentially yield a myriad of complex N-glycans that differ in branch number, composition, length, capping arrangements, and core modifications. Some examples to illustrate this diversity are shown in Figure 9.6. Lysosomal hydrolases degrade proteins, lipids, and glycans in the lysosome. Many of these enzymes are targeted to lysosomes by a specialized trafficking pathway that requires phosphorylated oligomannose N-glycans. The phosphorylation step involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to C-6 of Man residues of oligomannose N-glycans on lysosomal hydrolases in the cis-Golgi by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (heterodimer of GNPTAB and GNPTG) (Figure 9.4).']","Biantennary glycans typically consist of a core structure composed of three mannose residues and two N-acetylglucosamine residues. These glycans have branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain. The branches can be further extended towards the nonreducing end to form more complex structures. Additionally, biantennary glycans are terminated with a sialic acid at their nonreducing end, which is characteristic of mammalian glycans and important for immune response.","N-glycans of the hybrid and complex type may exist with two or more GlcNAc-bearing branches that are referred to as antennae.

 'Glycans are critical components of many antigens and may determine how epitopes are presented (e.g., presentation of glycolipid antigens by CD1a-positive lymphocytes and other antigen-presenting cells). Sialylated N-glycans in the IgG Fc domain play critical roles in antibody effector functions, and modulation of fucosylation and/or N-glycan display at Asn297 of human IgG regulates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation. Hyaluronan has a critical role in heart development (Chapter 16), and glycosaminoglycans modulate angiogenesis, in part because they bind growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (Chapter 17). The structural integrity of the walls of blood vessels is thought to depend on glycans, including a high density of sialic acids at the luminal surface of endothelial cells, as well as glycosaminoglycans within the basement membrane underlying endothelial cells. Cardiac muscle integrity and optimal cardiovascular function depend on various glycans. The luminal surface of epithelial cells in the upper and lower airways are covered by a dense and complex array of mostly O-glycosylated mucins (Chapter 10) secreted by goblet cells and submucosal glands. Structural glycoproteins, glycolipids, and secreted mucin molecules form barriers that maintain epithelial surface hydration and protect against physical and microbial invasion. Embryonic stem cells lacking complex N-glycans cannot properly organize the bronchial epithelium. N-glycans are also important for healthy lung function, as mice lacking the core α1-6-linked fucose of N-glycans develop emphysema-like symptoms caused by overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the lung tissue; this may result from aberrant transforming growth factor-β1 signaling through its misglycosylated receptor. Gene knockouts of individual mucin polypeptides show overlapping functions. Mice lacking O-fucose glycans in the lung do not generate secretory cells necessary for airway integrity. O-GlcNAc on proteins of the nucleus and cytoplasm modulate insulin action, and aberrant O-GlcNAcylation is linked to hyperglycemia (Chapter 19). N-glycans may also play a role in type II diabetes, as mice that cannot synthesize triantennary N-glycans develop diabetes when fed a high-fat diet. This deficiency alters the single N-glycan on the GLUT2 glucose transporter on pancreatic islet cells, accelerating its endocytosis, leading to loss from the cell surface and poor response to insulin. N-glycans may also be important for the production of functional thyroid hormones (e.g., targeting of endocytosed thyroglobulin to lysosomes for conversion to T3 and T4 in the thyroid gland; Chapter 33). The plasma half-life of several pituitary glycoprotein hormones is regulated by the presence of N-glycans that contain an unusual sulfated GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 31), which controls hormone clearance in the liver. O-GalNAc glycosylation can regulate peptide hormones by affecting proteolytic cleavage, as exemplified by O-glycan loss in the phosphate regulating hormone FGF23 causing familial tumoral calcinosis in patients deficient in GalNAc-T3 (Chapter 10). Glycosaminoglycans (Chapters 16 and 17) are required for normal development, organization, and structure of both the gums and teeth. Oral commensal organisms interact with each other or the host epithelium using glycan recognition. Salivary gland–generated mucins help protect the oral cavity by preventing bacterial biofilm formation on teeth (Chapters 10 and 42). However, mucin sialoglycans also provide binding sites for tooth cavity–facilitating bacteria. Glycans physically separate the luminal contents of the gut from the cells by organizing the mucin barrier that helps block pathogens. However, the microbiome of the GI tract also contains microbial symbionts that maintain a complex physiologic equilibrium.'
 'Conversely, there are examples of glycoproteins whose synthesis, folding, trafficking, sensitivity to proteolysis, or immune recognition seem unaffected by altering their glycosylation. Moreover, inhibitors (Chapter 55) or genetic mutations (Chapter 45) that only affect later steps of glycan processing often do not interfere with basic structural functions. Although structural functions of glycans are obviously of great importance to the intact organism, they do not explain the evolution of such a diverse and complex range of molecules. A further structural function of glycans is to act as a protective storage depot (“sponge”) for biologically important molecules. For example, many heparin-binding growth factors (Chapters 17 and 38) bind glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of the extracellular matrix, adjacent to cells that need to be stimulated (e.g., in the basement membrane underlying epithelial and endothelial cells). This prevents diffusion of factors away from the site of secretion (sometimes generating morphogenic gradients), protects them from nonspecific proteolysis, prolongs their active lives, and allows them to be released under specific conditions. Likewise, GAG chains in secretory granules can bind and protect protein contents of the granule and modulate their functions. There are several other instances in which glycans act as sinks or depots for biologically important molecules, such as water, ions, and immune regulatory proteins. The asymmetry in localization of most glycans on the outer plasma membrane leaflet can contribute to a signal for the intracellular rupture of vesicles, wherein exposed glycans are detected by cytoplasmic lectins (e.g., galectins) and trigger autophagy. Polymerized glycans such as starch and cellulose (in plants) and glycogen (in animals) can serve a major role in nutrient storage and sequestration. The relative resistance to digestibility of the internal linkages of such polymers by enzymes of intrinsic or extrinsic origin determines their relative role as structural components or as a mechanism for nutrient sequestration. Flowering plants have evolved important glycan-based strategies for exploiting animal behavior by making available sucrose-rich rewards to pollinators and seed dispersers (nectar and fruit). Many animal species have secondarily evolved strategies to store collected nectar (bees and honey pot ants). Flowering plants have also evolved countless ways of storing starch and other polysaccharide nutrients in the endosperm of their seeds, as a way to give the next generation a head start. The first intrinsic animal glycan receptors (GBPs) identified in vertebrates were those mediating clearance, turnover, and intracellular trafficking of soluble blood-plasma glycoproteins (Chapters 33 and 34), specifically recognizing certain terminal or subterminal glycans on the circulating glycoprotein. However, even the most precise examples, such as the role of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes (Chapter 33), feature exceptions. For instance, Man-6-phosphorylation is not absolutely required for trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in certain cell types, nor is it operative in some “lower” eukaryotes. There are also endocytic receptors recognizing specific glycan sequences, whose functions have yet to be assigned. Several instances exist wherein free glycans can have hormone-like actions that induce specific responses in a structure-specific manner. Examples include interaction of small glycans (lipochitooligosaccharides) from bacterial and fungal symbionts with GBPs of plant roots (Chapter 40) and bioactive properties of hyaluronan fragments recognized by GBPs in mammalian systems (Chapter 16), both of which induce biological responses in a size- and structure-dependent manner. Likewise, free heparan or dermatan sulfate fragments released by certain cell types can have biological effects in situations such as wound healing. In many of these instances, the putative GBP receptors for these molecules and their precise mechanisms are still being defined. It is now clear that glycans have many specific information-bearing biological roles in cell–cell recognition and cell–matrix interactions. A well-characterized example is the selectin family of adhesion molecules.'
 'Likewise, free heparan or dermatan sulfate fragments released by certain cell types can have biological effects in situations such as wound healing. In many of these instances, the putative GBP receptors for these molecules and their precise mechanisms are still being defined. It is now clear that glycans have many specific information-bearing biological roles in cell–cell recognition and cell–matrix interactions. A well-characterized example is the selectin family of adhesion molecules. These cell-surface proteins recognize glycans on ligands and mediate critical interactions between and amongst blood cells and vascular cells in a variety of normal and pathological situations but are also involved in implantation of embryos on the endometrium (Chapter 34). Glycans and GBPs on cell surfaces can interact specifically with molecules in the matrix or even with glycans on the same cell surface (in cis). Some critical recognition sites are actually combinations of glycans and protein. For example, P-selectin recognizes the generic selectin ligand sialyl Lewis x with high affinity only in the context of the amino-terminal 13 amino acids of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which include required sulfated tyrosine residues (Chapter 34). Glycan-binding sites of cell-surface receptors like Siglecs can be masked/“blocked” by cognate glycans on the same cell surface, making them unavailable for recognition of external ligands (Chapter 35). On the other hand, some glycans can act as “biological masks,” preventing recognition of underlying residues (e.g., sialic acids can mask recognition of underlying β-galactosides by galectins or other GBPs). Carbohydrate–carbohydrate interactions can also have specific biological roles. A classic example is the species-specific interaction between marine sponges, mediated via homotypic binding of glycans on a large cell-surface glycoprotein, perhaps indicating the critical importance of glycosylation for the evolution of multicellularity. Another example is the compaction of the mouse embryo at the morula stage, which seems to be facilitated by a Lewis x–Lewis x interaction. The single-site affinities of such interactions are often weak and thus difficult to measure. However, if the molecules are present in very high copy numbers, a large number of relatively low-affinity interactions can collaborate to produce a high-avidity “Velcro” effect that is sufficient to mediate biologically relevant interactions. Glycosylation can also modulate interactions of proteins with one another. Some growth factor receptors acquire their binding abilities in a glycosylation-dependent manner while in transit through the Golgi apparatus. This may limit unwanted early interactions of a newly synthesized receptor with a growth factor that is synthesized in the same cell. Glycosylation of a polypeptide can also mediate an on–off switching effect. For example, when the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotrophin is deglycosylated, it still binds to its receptor with similar affinity, but it fails to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In most instances, the effects of glycosylation are incomplete; that is, glycosylation appears to be “tuning” a primary function of the protein rather than turning it on or off. For example, the activity of some glycosylated growth factors and hormones can be modulated over a wide range by the extent and type of their glycosylation. Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain. This becomes particularly evident when recombinant glycoprotein molecules are produced in biotechnology, bearing different glycosylation patterns based on the evolutionary history of the cell expression system in use (bacterial, yeast, insect, nonhuman mammal, or human). The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells.'
 'In addition, the action of MAN1B1, MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 can all be blocked experimentally by the inhibitors, deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine, resulting in Man8-9GlcNAc2 on mature glycoproteins. Most mature glycoproteins have some oligomannose N-glycans that are not processed in the cis-Golgi. Biosynthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans (Figure 9.1) is initiated in the medial-Golgi by the action of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase called GlcNAc-TI (MGAT1), which adds a GlcNAc residue to the C-2 of the α1-3Man in the core of Man5GlcNAc2 (Figure 9.4). Subsequently, the majority of N-glycans are trimmed by α-mannosidase II enzymes (MAN2A1 or MAN2A2) in the medial-Golgi, which remove the terminal α1-3Man and α1-6Man residues from GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 to form GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2. It is important to note that α-mannosidase II cannot trim Man5GlcNAc2 unless it has been acted on by MGAT1. Once both Man residues are removed, a second GlcNAc is added to the C-2 of the α1-6Man in the N-glycan core by the action of GlcNAc-TII (MGAT2) to yield the precursor for all biantennary, complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans are formed if the GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 glycan produced by MGAT1 is not acted on by α-mannosidase II. Incomplete action of α-mannosidase II can result in GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc2 hybrids. Small oligomannose N-glycans have been found in relatively large amounts in invertebrates and plants. These Man3–4GlcNAc2 N-glycans (paucimannose N-glycans) are formed from GlcNAcMan3–4GlcNAc2 following removal of the peripheral GlcNAc by a Golgi hexosaminidase that acts after α-mannosidase II (Chapters 24 and 26). Paucimannose glycans are also found in mammals, and can be elevated in cancer, inflammation, and stem cell development.

MGAT5B or GlcNAc-TIX catalyzes the same reaction but preferentially on O-mannose glycans in brain. Another branch, found in birds and fish, can be initiated at C-4 of the core α1-6Man by GlcNAc-TVI (MGAT6; Figure 9.5). Genes related to GlcNAc-TVI exist in mammalian genomes (MGAT4C). Complex and hybrid N-glycans may also carry a “bisecting” GlcNAc residue that is attached to the β-Man of the core by GlcNAc-TIII (MGAT3) (Figure 9.5). A bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary N-glycan is shown in Figure 9.5, and it may be present in all of the more highly branched N-glycans. However, it is not usually extended. Branching and core modification of complex N-glycans.']","Biantennary N-glycans typically serve functions related to branching and core modification in complex N-glycans. They may contain more branches due to specific GlcNAc-transferases in the Golgi acting after certain enzymatic actions. Additionally, biantennary N-glycans can undergo further sugar additions, elongation of branching GlcNAc residues, and capping or decoration of elongated branches, contributing to the diversity of mature, complex N-glycans.","Biantennary N-glycan structure with two terminal alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids is a common and optimal structure that is able to enhance the activities of antibodies against cancer, influenza, and inflammatory diseases.",1.0,0.9520266916248545,0.6644301895476334,0.008333333333333333,0.19999999998,0.0
"How does glycosylation affect the stability and function of therapeutic proteins, and what strategies are used to optimize glycan profiles?","['dollars annually worldwide. Therapeutic glycoproteins or glycan-processing/recognizing proteins are typically produced recombinantly in cell culture systems or, less commonly, in the milk of transgenic animals. Control of glycosylation is of major importance during the development of these drugs, because their glycan chains have marked effects on stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics in intact organisms. Frequently, glycosylation must be optimized to ensure prolonged circulatory half-life in the blood. Manipulation of glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues and cell types has also been a useful element of drug design. Erythropoietin (EPO) is the most successful biotechnology product to date. It is a circulating cytokine that binds to the erythropoietin receptor, inducing proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. EPO was developed to treat anemias caused by bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy or lack of erythropoietin (e.g., renal failure). Natural and recombinant forms of erythropoietin carry three sialylated complex N-glycans and one sialylated O-glycan. Although in vitro the activity of deglycosylated erythropoietin is comparable to that of the fully glycosylated molecule, its activity in vivo is reduced by ∼90%, because poorly glycosylated EPO is rapidly cleared by filtration in the kidney. Undersialylated EPO is also rapidly cleared by galactose receptors in hepatocytes and macrophages (see Chapter 31). Fully sialylated chains and increased tetra-antennary branching reduce these problems and increase EPO activity in vivo nearly tenfold. Addition of an N-glycosylation site also increases half-life and activity in vivo. Covalently linking polyethylene glycol to the protein also reduces clearance by the kidney. Erythropoietin is unusual because it is small enough to be cleared by the kidney if it is underglycosylated. For most glycoprotein therapeutics, a more important consideration is minimizing clearance by galactose-binding hepatic receptors by ensuring full sialylation of glycans. Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation. Sialidases and other glycosidases that are either secreted or released by dead cells can also degrade the previously intact product in the culture medium. These issues were hotly debated with the advent of “biosimilars” or generic versions of glycoproteins. The need to prove composition has fueled efforts devoted to glycan analysis and sequencing. Patenting new therapeutics is typically based on the composition of matter in the claimed molecule. Small molecules of defined structure and nonglycosylated proteins are easily captured in this manner. However, glycoproteins, especially those with multiple glycosylation sites, render it virtually impossible to obtain preparations that contain only a single glycoform. For examples of glycosylated therapeutics, please see Table 57.1. Thus, most biotherapeutic glycoproteins consist of a mixture of glycoforms. Licensing bodies allow for a certain range of variation in glycoforms and complexity of the mixture. However, the manufacturer and the agency must agree on the extent such variation is acceptable for a given drug formulation. Biopharmaceutical companies therefore spend considerable effort in assuring that their products fall within these defined ranges, once these are approved by licensing bodies. The inherent difficulty in reproducing complex glycoform mixtures also complicates efforts to make generic forms of recombinant glycoprotein drugs. Given the complexities of producing glycotherapeutic agents in mammalian cells, licensing agencies use consistency in glycoform composition as an indirect measure of the quality of process control in production. Glycosylation differences can have implications for the patentability of agents in which the polypeptide remains constant. Marked glycosylation differences have been used to define agents as being unique.'
 'Recombinant antibodies with truncated N-glycans had lower affinity for Fcγ receptors, suggesting that this glycoengineering strategy may be suitable for use with neutralizing antibodies. Deconstruction of the N-glycosylation pathway in CHO cells was performed by precise gene editing to knock out 19 glycosyltransferases, including all four α2-3-sialyltransferases that function on N-glycans (Figure 56.3). Combining knockout of St3gal4 and St3gal6 with site-specific knock-in of St6gal1 resulted in homogeneous α2-6-sialylation. Combinatorial knockout of all isoenzymes involved in N-glycan sialylation, galactosylation/LacNAc formation, branching, and core fucosylation has provided a design matrix for improving the homogeneity of N-glycans in CHO cells. A combination of five gene knockouts and the knock-in of St6gal1 created the glycoprotein therapeutic erythropoietin having homogeneous biantennary N-glycans with terminal α2-6-Neu5Ac. Wider engineering of almost all genes involved in N-glycosylation in CHO cells has shown that there are few limitations for engineering of glycosylation. For example, the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (Gnptab) that tags select oligomannose N-glycans on glycoproteins destined for lysosomal targeting was knocked out to produce lysosomal enzymes bearing complex-type sialylated glycans with extended blood circulation and improved biodistribution. (A) A complex N-glycan with glycosyltransferases responsible for each reaction. Combinatorial knockout of the glycosyltransferase isoenzyme genes indicated led to the identification of the primary genes (highlighted in bold) controlling N-glycan branching (more...) Therapeutic glycoprotein production still suffers from heterogeneity, including variations in which Asn residues are glycosylated (site occupancy, macroheterogeneity) and/or the diversity of mature glycan structures at any one site (microheterogeneity). This is currently addressed by ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through the use of highly standardized bioprocessing protocols, but this strategy is far from optimal. For example, incompletely sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins may be cleared by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell–Morell receptor), resulting in inconsistent circulatory half-lives of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 34). Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sialylation by overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases as well as inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases in host cells. Protein-specific glycosylation patterns and heterogeneity are more difficult to control. Nonhuman mammalian cell lines can produce two immunogenic nonhuman glycans: α1-3-Gal added to N-acetyllactosamine and Neu5Gc added to Gal or GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 15). The α1-3-galactosyltransferase and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydrolase genes responsible are inactive in humans. Although α1-3-Gal and Neu5Gc are not produced in CHO cells, both genes have been knocked out as a precaution. Even so, Neu5Gc scavenged from animal glycoproteins used in cell culture can appear in expressed glycoproteins, so use of defined media lacking nonhuman glycoproteins is also necessary. In engineering mammalian cell lines, it is important to consider that the glycosylation capacity is driven by the expression of a subset of available enzyme genes, but unexpressed genes can become activated. Thus, cell-specific glycosylation features are generally controlled by transcriptional regulation rather than mutations or gene aberrations. Analysis of all known glycosylation genes in five distinct CHO production cell lines derived from the original CHO-K1 cell line found no apparent deleterious mutations or loss of genes, despite severe chromosomal alterations. This suggests that one must consider all the known glycogenes in a mammalian cell line for glycoengineering strategies. Engineering the glycosylation capacity of CHO cells has also enabled more homogeneous bioconjugation of therapeutic drugs.'
 'The inherent difficulty in reproducing complex glycoform mixtures also complicates efforts to make generic forms of recombinant glycoprotein drugs. Given the complexities of producing glycotherapeutic agents in mammalian cells, licensing agencies use consistency in glycoform composition as an indirect measure of the quality of process control in production. Glycosylation differences can have implications for the patentability of agents in which the polypeptide remains constant. Marked glycosylation differences have been used to define agents as being unique. However, it is usually necessary to show that the differences in glycosylation being claimed have a correspondingly significant effect in changing the functionality of the drug in question. The associated pharmaceutical licensing and legal issues are rapidly evolving to keep pace with scientific advances in this area. Examples of glycan-based drugs, their target diseases, and modes of action  There are limits as to how much of a biotherapeutic glycoprotein an animal cell line can produce. Production becomes an issue in cases where very large amounts of a particular glycoprotein are needed. Glycoprotein production in plants or yeast is attractive but makes it necessary to eliminate risks arising from the nonhuman glycans of plant and fungal cells that could cause excessively rapid clearance and/or antigenic reactions. Many plant and yeast glycans are immunogenic and elicit glycan-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in humans when delivered parenterally. A variety of mammalian genes have been introduced into yeast and/or genes that are producing nonhuman glycosylation have been eliminated. Extensively engineered yeast strains are capable of producing biantennary N-linked glycans with the human sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) but the productivity of such yeast strains is often low. Efforts to engineer yeast to make human-like O-glycans are underway. Plants and algae as well as insect cell lines have also been used to engineer recombinant glycoproteins, but, as in yeast, the glycans produced by plants differ from those found in vertebrates. The antigenic differences that arise in recombinant glycoproteins produced in plants become less problematic if used for topical or oral administration, because humans are normally exposed to plant glycans in the diet. The cost of production is much lower than in animal cell culture systems and animal sera are not needed. As in yeast, “humanizing plants” with respect to glycosylation may allow the production of nonimmunogenic glycoproteins. Chemical methods for synthesizing entire glycoproteins from scratch have been developed and single glycoforms of EPO have been prepared by total synthesis. Given the complexity of glycoprotein synthesis, scale-up of these processes is challenging and an area of intense research activity (see Chapter 49). All monosaccharides needed for cellular glycan synthesis can be obtained from glucose through metabolic interconversions (see Chapter 4). Alternatively, monosaccharides can be derived from the diet or salvaged from degraded glycans. The relative contributions of different sources can vary with the cell type. For instance, even though all mammalian cells use sialic acid, only some contain high amounts of UDP-GlcNAc epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), which is required for the de novo synthesis of CMP-sialic acid. But sialic acid salvage from degraded glycans is quite efficient, decreasing the demand on the de novo pathway. Similarly, galactose, fucose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine can come from diet or be salvaged for glycan synthesis, whereas glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, and xylose cannot. All monosaccharides derived from diet or degraded glycans can be catabolized for energy, and, again, cells vary in their reliance on the different pathways. The variable contributions of these pathways are important for therapy of some diseases. Patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib (CDG-Ib), who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase, benefit greatly from oral mannose supplementation to bypass the insufficient supply of glucose-derived mannose 6-phosphate. A few CDG-IIc patients defective in fucose transporters have been treated with fucose to restore synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x on leukocytes (see Chapter 42).'
 'Large libraries of engineered isogenic cells with subtle differences of all types of glycosylation are available for dissection of glycan functions using different assays not limited to binding. Expanding these to organotypic tissue models is providing deeper insights. The ability to produce glycoproteins with a large variety of glycans opens up for unbiased testing of different glycoforms and determines the optimal design for therapeutic uses. Glycans can be custom designed, for example, to improve homogeneity, circulation time, targeting to select organs, or stimulating immunity. A word of caution, however: Whereas glycoengineering by knockout is fairly straightforward, there is still considerable work needed to establish methods to build robust complex glycosylation capabilities requiring multiple gene insertions in cells. Here, activation of endogenous genes in mammalian cells may provide a solution. Gene editing technologies caused a revolution in the glycoscience field, and we have only begun to see the new possibilities for manipulating glycosylation in cells and organisms and for exploiting glycoengineering in therapeutic glycoproteins and biologics. Finally, the well-established power and cost efficiency of using bacteria as reactors for production of proteins is now being harnessed to generate designer glycoproteins. There remains much to be explored in this rapidly developing area, but the potential is enormous. The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Catherina Steenhoft and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Jenny Mortimer.'
 'Adding desirable glycosyltransferase activities to eukaryotic cells is achieved by transfection of glycogenes from any organism, random integration of plasmid DNA, and antibiotic selection of stable clones. Although this strategy is successful, it provides no control over site(s) of genomic integration (unless specific strategies are used), gene copy number, or gene expression levels. Overexpression of enzymes can lead to disruption of normal glycosylation patterns and unpredictable glycosylation. Instability of the introduced glycosylation genes and the use of antibiotics for selection have also been problematic for the long-term use of such engineered cells for production of therapeutic glycoproteins. Knockout of glycosylation genes to eliminate unwanted glycans has long been a simple task in bacteria and yeast. Although powerful, knockout or knock-in strategies have been time-consuming and difficult to use in “higher” eukaryotic cells (see Fut8 knockout below). However, these difficulties were substantially reduced with the introduction of nuclease-based precise gene editing tools including zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator–like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/targeted Cas9 endonucleases (CRISPR/Cas9), which enable highly specific gene manipulation in all cell types (Figure 56.2; Chapters 27 and 49). These tools can also be used to activate endogenous silent genes, edit gene sequences to mimic hypomorphic disease mutations, and insert foreign genes at specific genomic sites. Precise gene editing modalities. Glycosyltransferases are represented with their catalytic domains and amino-terminal membrane spanning domains. Examples of gene editing for gene disruption (knockout), mutation, tagging, and insertion of heterologous (more...) Precise gene editing can insert foreign genes at “safe harbor” sites in the genome to ensure stable expression and avoid interfering with endogenous gene expression. One such safe harbor in human cells is the AAVS1 site on chromosome 19 known to enable stable expression of transgenes without adverse effects. However, precise genetic engineering allows insertion of one or more foreign genes at any position in the genome. For example, precise knock-in of glycogenes can be combined with knockout by inserting an exogenous gene in place of an unwanted endogenous gene. Precise knock-in strategies also enable control of the number of copies inserted and can be used to insert entire landing platforms of multiple genes inserted consecutively. Successful expression of an enzyme or transporter for glycoengineering requires that the expressed protein finds its way to the correct subcellular compartment. Heterologous expression of type 2 Golgi transmembrane glycosyltransferases, for example, often requires testing different Golgi retention sequences. Although design guidance is available, this is often a trial and error exercise, and in some cases a combinatorial screening is required to identify the optimal construct. The most common bacterium used for heterologous protein production, Escherichia coli, does not have the native capacity to glycosylate proteins. However, research in the last two decades identified N- and O-glycoproteins, and the glycosylation pathways responsible for their biosynthesis, in the pathogenic proteobacterium Campylobacter jejuni and other bacterial species. Moreover, several bacterial toxins have glycosyltransferase domains that exert their pathogenicity by glycosylating highly specific amino acids in key host proteins to interfere with essential cellular functions. Chapter 21 discusses glycosylation in Eubacteria. Another unique feature of bacteria is that sugar nucleotide donors are synthesized and remain in the cytosol, so that engineered glycan assembly on a lipid carrier (for systems based on en bloc glycosylation) or on proteins directly (for systems based on processive glycosylation) must take place in the cytosol unless nucleotide sugar transporters are introduced to the periplasmic membrane. Bacteria efficiently produce free and lipid-linked oligo- and polysaccharides including capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) (Chapter 21), and these pathways have been engineered to produce a variety of complex human-like glycans. In particular, the LPS pathway has been used to engineer and display glycans in E. coli.']","Glycosylation plays a crucial role in the stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic proteins. The glycan chains attached to these proteins can impact their circulatory half-life, clearance rates, and overall efficacy in vivo. For example, optimizing glycosylation by ensuring full sialylation and increasing branching can enhance the stability and activity of therapeutic proteins like erythropoietin. Strategies such as manipulating glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues, controlling glycosylation during production to meet regulatory requirements for consistency, and engineering glycosylation pathways in cell culture systems are used to optimize glycan profiles. These strategies involve precise gene editing to modify glycosylation patterns, knockout of specific glycosylation genes to eliminate unwanted glycans, overexpression of relevant enzymes to improve sialylation, and ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through standardized bioprocessing protocols.","Glycosylation can also enhance the stability of the protein therapeutic against proteolytic degradation, oxidation, precipitation, and denaturation. As glycosylation can shield hydrophobic regions on the glycoprotein’s surface, it can prevent protein aggregation, which can help decrease immunogenicity. Glycosylation can also hide immunogenetic protein epitopes on the glycoprotein’s surface. While glycosylation has many effects on glycoprotein drugs, it’s challenging to ensure that the final drug product has desired glycosylation patterns. The glycosylation patterns on a protein can be heterogeneous in terms of where the modification occurs and the modification itself.",1.0,0.7627036790464325,0.7952670078704146,0.01680672268907563,0.99999999998,1.0
Can you explain the concept of glycan microarrays and their application in studying glycan-protein interactions?,"['Saturation transfer difference (STD) measurements can also be used. Here, 1H-NMR is used to detect glycans which are in large excess over GBP. Often these techniques work best for relatively low affinity interactions. Another spectroscopic approach to measuring glycan binding to a protein relies on changes in intrinsic fluorescence on interacting with a glycan. Finally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can also be used to define protein–glycan or glycan–glycan interactions. In this approach, the force required to separate a glycan-coated bead from an immobilized GBP can be measured in highly quantitative methods. Remarkably, single-molecule force measurements can be made by AFM. This method not only gives information about the strength of binding, but also provides insight into the molecular nature of noncovalent bond formation between the protein and its ligand. The conventional ELISA has been adapted for studying glycans and GBPs in a variety of formats. Of course, many glycans are antigens and antibodies to them can be analyzed in the conventional ELISA format. Some of the earliest ELISA-type approaches used biotinylated bacterial polysaccharides captured on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates to measure interactions of antibodies to the polysaccharides. In most types of ELISAs used in glycobiology, either an antibody or a GBP of interest is immobilized and the binding of a soluble glycan to the protein is measured, or the reagents are reversed and the glycan or glycoconjugate is immobilized. In either approach, the glycans are modified in some way, such as addition of biotin or a fluorophore, to allow their detection, or they may be coupled to another protein with an attached reporter group (e.g., a fluorescent moiety or an enzyme such as peroxidase). Competition ELISA-type assays are also used to probe the binding site of a GBP. In this approach, a glycan is coupled to a carrier protein (the target), and its binding to an immobilized GBP is detected directly. Competitive glycans are added to the wells and their competition for the GBP is measured as a function of concentration to obtain an IC50. Under appropriate conditions and concentrations of the ligand, the Ki values and Kd values are similar. The major advantages of this approach are that (1) it is relatively easy; (2) it has high-throughput capability and can be used in an automated fashion by robotic handling; (3) it can provide relative Kd values if the GBP concentration is varied appropriately over a large range and binding is saturable; and (4) it has the capacity to define the relative binding activity of a panel of glycoconjugates. The major limitations of this approach are that (1) it does not provide direct information about affinity constants or other thermodynamic parameters; (2) it can require relatively high amounts of GBP and glycans if used as a general screening array; and (3) it usually requires chemical derivatization of glycans or GBPs. Glycan microarrays are an extension of both ELISA-type formats and modern DNA and protein microarray technology. In a glycan microarray, glycans are linked, usually covalently, to a solid surface through reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-esters or epoxide-containing supports on a glass slide. Glycans are prepared to contain reactive primary amines at their reducing termini, but other chemical coupling methods are available. In addition, noncovalent immobilization can be used in which lipid-derivatized glycans or glycolipids are deposited onto nitrocellulose-coated slides. Also, neoglycoconjugates (e.g., glycans covalently attached to protein carriers as in neoglycoproteins) can be generated and then coupled to a surface to present glycans for interactions with GBPs. The glycans or glycan-containing materials are printed, much like DNA is printed for DNA microarrays, using contact printers or piezoelectric (noncontact) printing (Figure 29.6). Usually, a few nanoliters of solutions containing glycans in concentrations of 1–100 µm are deposited by a robotic printer on the glass surface in ∼100-µm-diameter spots.'
 'Two annotated and searchable databases for O-GlcNAcylated (OGN) proteins have been established, which currently list nearly 8,000 OGN proteins in human cells. The CAZy database (www.cazy.org) of carbohydrate-active enzymes has also played an important role in advancing the field. The overall goal is to coordinate all of these efforts into bioinformatic databases that a nonexpert can explore in a manner similar to current resources for DNA, RNA, and proteins. The combination of organic synthesis and chemoenzymatic synthesis will allow the production of well-defined glycan arrays that contain the various binding epitopes for glycan-binding proteins. Recombinant glycosyltransferases will become common tools to generate specific glycans on glycoproteins and living cells, and these enzymes will greatly enhance the many studies that now rely on the use of lectins (Chapter 48), whose specificity is often not well-defined. Finally, the rapidly expanding analytical toolkit will be instrumental to decipher the regulatory mechanisms that mediate homeostasis of glycoconjugates at a cellular level. As with analytical methods, it is also important to “democratize” the approaches by developing simple methods for the average biologist working at the bench. In recent years, great advancements in the glycomic profiling of glycans from cells, tissues, or organisms have occurred. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has allowed the rapid profiling of the majority of N- and O-glycans in a sample (Chapter 51). As matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) instruments also gain the ability to perform tandem mass spectrometry, confidence in the structure of profiled glycans will continue to improve. However, detailed structural analysis of individual glycans still remains a low-throughput method that requires considerable expertise and expensive instrumentation. The development of glycan arrays presenting hundreds of different glycans of defined structure is perhaps one of the most impactful recent developments in glycobiology (Chapter 56). These arrays have allowed for rapid, high-throughput analysis of the binding specificities of numerous biologically important glycan-binding proteins, including lectins, antibodies, viruses, and bacteria. It has been estimated that these arrays will need to contain between 10,000 and 20,000 different glycans to cover most possible glycotopes (this highly conservative estimate does not take into account various common and labile modifications of glycans). In addition, more specialized arrays will be required to study glycan-binding proteins made by prokaryotes or to study proteins that bind to glycosaminoglycans, for example. Fortunately, the ability to make such large and diverse glycan arrays is on the horizon, and the remaining challenge will be to better understand the parameters of the glycan arrays, besides the glycans themselves, that influence binding, such as linkers, spacing, and density of glycans on solid supports. Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states. Significant progress has also been made in Systems Glycobiology by better integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Our understanding as to how miRNAs and transcription factors regulate glycan expression has also improved in the last few years (Chapters 51 and 52). At the present time, the study of glycan structure/function relationships requires highly specialized expertise in synthetic and analytical chemistry. The inherent difficulty in studying glycans remains a major challenge preventing glycobiology—the study of glycan function—from entering mainstream conceptual frameworks of biology. In response to this challenge, strong emphasis has recently been placed on the development of facile technologies that will allow nonglycobiologists without specialized analytical chemistry skills to study glycans in a meaningful way. In fact, the use of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase probes to manipulate glycans is not any more difficult than the use of restriction enzymes and endonucleases to analyze DNA. The use of antibodies and lectins specific for glycans also exemplifies methods that can be readily applied by biologists lacking expensive analytical equipment or extensive glycobiology expertise (Chapter 49). In fact, several kits for the study of glycans have emerged, as companies recognize the future market potential of glycobiology.'
 'The glycans or glycan-containing materials are printed, much like DNA is printed for DNA microarrays, using contact printers or piezoelectric (noncontact) printing (Figure 29.6). Usually, a few nanoliters of solutions containing glycans in concentrations of 1–100 µm are deposited by a robotic printer on the glass surface in ∼100-µm-diameter spots. Slides are incubated for several hours to allow the chemical reactions to covalently fix the samples on the slides. The slides are then blocked to prevent nonspecific binding of reagents, and these microarrays overlaid with a buffer containing the GBP and incubated for several hours to allow equilibrium binding to occur. The slides are washed to remove unbound GBP and then analyzed. Analyses involve fluorescence detection, which means that either the GBP has to be directly fluorescent-labeled or a fluorescent-tagged antibody to the GBP must be used. Preparation of covalent glycan microarrays printed on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)- or epoxide-activated glass slides. In this example, the glycans have a free amine at the reducing end and are coupled to the glass slide. After washing to remove unattached (more...) The chief features of the successful microarrays are the variety of glycans they contain. However, the clustered and relatively high amount of glycans densely packed that can bind detectable amounts of GBPs, may also promote binding of even relatively low affinity multivalent GBPs. Thus, the density of the ligand should be taken into account when interpreting the results. The type of linker used and the state of the monosaccharide at the reducing end (i.e., open ring, open or closed ring form attached to the linker) can also affect binding. Binding is visualized or imaged as intensely fluorescent spots against a dark background. The data are visually imaged on a scanner and then graphically represented. In a typical successful analysis a GBP may bind to several glycans that share structural features, often termed glycan-binding determinants or motifs. If desired, the GBP can then be tested for its binding to the identified candidates by other methods such as titration microcalorimetry or fluorescence polarization, to define the Kd as discussed above. The use of microarrays in characterizing GBPs is a central component of functional glycomics (Chapter 51). Publicly available glycan microarray binding data repositories are increasingly used in the field. A variation of glycan microarrays is a bead-based Luminex-type assay. In this high-throughput approach glycans are covalently immobilized on Luminex beads of different fluorophore properties. Thus, a multiplexed approach is taken where a GBP is mixed with a set of conjugated beads each identifiable by its fluorescent properties. The GBP may be biotinylated, allowing detection by fluorescent streptavidin, or the GBP may be detected by binding to specific antibody or another reagent if the GBP is epitope-tagged. The degree of binding of the GBP is a measure of its affinity and specificity for a particular glycan. The advantages of this approach is that it is high-throughput, allowing thousands of assays to be performed automatically, as well as utilizing small amounts of both glycan and GBP. The collection of data and its analysis are also automated. A limitation of the approach is that each glycan to be derivatized must be activated by having a primary amine or other chemistry for conjugation, and each conjugation of a glycan needs to be independently validated. Multivalent GBPs interacting with multivalent ligands, as expressed on cells, can cause the cells to agglutinate. This can be exploited by allowing one to measure the ability of a soluble glycan to block the agglutination activity of the GBP. The concentration of the soluble glycan that provides 50% inhibition of agglutination is taken as the inhibitory concentration (IC50). Such approaches have been used for many years in studies on lectin-induced agglutination of cells and were useful in elucidating the nature of the human blood group substances. If a sufficiently large panel of soluble glycans is used, then the relative efficacies of each of these can be measured to help define the specificity of the GBP. A major advantage of this technique is that it does not require tagging of the glycans.'
 ""This is an important starting point for any comprehensive glycome analysis. The second level of analysis defines specific glycans associated with individual proteins or lipids. Analysis of the complete repertoire of a cell's glycoconjugates, including the microheterogeneity of glycans present at individual sites of attachment, lies, for example, at the intersection of glycomics and proteomics (“glycoproteomics”) and of glycomics and lipidomics (“glycolipidomics”). A third level of complexity involves determining which glycans and/or glycoconjugates are expressed in specific cells, tissues, or secretions at specific times or conditions. This level of analysis is essential if the goal is to reveal new functions in cell–cell communication or to correlate particular glycomes with specific diseases. Of course, none of these approaches recapitulates the actual arrangement of the complex glycan forest present on the surface of cells or in extracellular matrices. The spatial organization of the glycome on cell surfaces is currently only amenable to microscopy-, array- and flow cytometry–based imaging using various glycan-recognizing probes (lectins/GRPs; Chapter 48). The spatial organization of glycans in tissue sections can also be explored by recent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS imaging methods. The term “glycomics” thus describes studies designed to define the complete repertoire of glycans that a cell, tissue, or organism produces under specified conditions of time, location, and environment. “Glycoproteomics” describes this glycome as it appears on the cellular proteome. Glycoproteomics determines which sites on each glycoprotein of a cell are glycosylated and ideally includes the identification and quantitation of the heterogeneous glycan structures at each site. The molecular complexity of the glycoproteome makes glycomics and glycoproteomics both exciting and daunting. Because neither the genome, transcriptome, nor the proteome can accurately predict the dynamically expressed protein-linked glycans, the glycome and glycoproteome must be analyzed directly. Techniques used to characterize a single glycoprotein after isolation (Figure 51.1) or a complex mixture of glycoproteins (the glycoproteome) (Figure 51.2) are described in this chapter. Analysis of a purified single glycoprotein. Example of the characterization of an affinity purified serum glycoprotein, haptoglobin, including (left panel) a total glycomics profile of N-glycans released from the protein, fluorescently derivatized with (more...) Glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics of a complex mixture of glycoproteins. In this workflow, the structures of the PNGase F released N-glycans from a total extract of rat brain membrane proteins are first analyzed in detail (1) and the sites of glycosylation (more...) As described below, numerous techniques have been developed for interrogating the glycome and glycoproteome. Because no single technique can at present define all aspects of the glycome or glycoproteome, several approaches are typically used in parallel from assembling an individual cell type glycan repertoire to determining the global tissue expression for example. Different approaches and techniques are required to characterize, for example, the structures of glycoproteins versus glycolipids, N-glycans versus O-glycans, and sulfated GAGs versus neutral glycans (Chapter 50). In contrast, a single technique such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to identify and quantitate all mRNA transcripts at once, a much easier task. Glycomic methods and analyses have been mostly directed toward protein glycosylation because of the current proteomics focus, although considerable effort is being directed toward methods that encompass all glycan conjugates. As an example of a typical experiment, a glycoprotein-enriched sample is prepared from a cell lysate and their released glycans analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) and/or mass spectrometry (MS). In the case of glycoproteins, the N-glycans can be selectively released enzymatically or chemically, separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, and are often sequenced online by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with or without exoglycosidase treatments.""

These arrays contain a variety of glycans that can bind detectable amounts of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). The density of the ligand, type of linker used, and the state of the monosaccharide at the reducing end can affect binding. By overlaying the microarrays with a buffer containing the GBP and analyzing the bound GBP after washing, researchers can study the binding specificities of various GBPs. The data obtained from glycan microarrays can help identify glycan-binding determinants or motifs and can be further validated using other methods like titration microcalorimetry or fluorescence polarization to determine binding affinity (Kd). Glycan microarrays are a central component of functional glycomics and are increasingly used in the field to understand glycan-protein interactions.","Glycan microarrays consist of a panel of glycans immobilized on a microchip that can be used to evaluate binding specificity of glycan-binding proteins.

"What are the computational methods available for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data, and what are their limitations?","['Some MS/MS instruments have a single “ion trap” analyzer that traps ions and functions as the collision chamber. Ion traps are relatively inexpensive, but they lack the sensitivity, versatility, and mass range of most tandem instruments. The Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS), a very expensive but very powerful instrument, has extremely high mass accuracy. An alternative to CAD for fragment ion production has been developed for FTMS. This is called electron capture dissociation (ECD) and involves the capture of an electron by the multiply charged molecular ion. A related technique, called electron transfer dissociation (ETD) was subsequently developed for tandem instruments. Both ECD and ETD yield radical cations generated by different fragmentation pathways than ions produced by CAD. ECD and ETD are especially useful for defining glycosylation sites in glycopeptides. Although underivatized glycans can be analyzed by MALDI- or ESI-MS/MS, superior data can be obtained if the glycans are derivatized before MS analysis. Derivatization methods can be broadly divided into two categories: (1) “tagging” of reducing ends and (2) protection of all functional groups. Commonly used tagging reagents include p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, 2-AP and 2-AB. This type of derivatization facilitates chromatographic purification and enhances useful fragmentation. Protection of hydroxyl groups by permethylation is by far the most important type of full derivatization used in glycan MS (although with accompanying destruction of acetyl esters and other base-labile functional groups during the derivatization process). In MS/MS experiments, permethylated derivatives form abundant fragment ions produced by cleavage at susceptible glycosidic linkages, notably on the reducing side of each HexNAc residue. In N- and O-glycans, this preferred fragmentation unambiguously establishes the antennae sequences. MALDI- and ESI-MS can equally be applied to the characterization of glycolipid and GAG derived glycans. However, in the latter case, because of the size and high degree of sulfation of GAGs, MS analysis is usually performed after hydrolysis of the polymeric chain. As described above, mass spectrometry measures the mass to charge ratio of glycans during the analytical process. However, as multiple monosaccharides that make up a glycan can have the same mass (e.g., mannose, galactose and glucose) and monosaccharides can be linked together in different ways, a single peak in a glycan mass spectrum can actually be made up of multiple structural isomers. Ion mobility mass spectrometry additionally separates ions based on their size and shape which can resolve glycan structural isomers with the same mass to charge ratio (see Further Reading). Broadly speaking, the unique strengths of MS can be exploited in two general ways in glycobiology. The first is to obtain detailed characterization of purified individual glycans or mixtures of glycans. In this type of study, it is essential to acquire sufficient rigorous data to define structure unambiguously; many different MS-based experiments will be required, often complemented by NMR, linkage analysis, and profiling of enzyme digests. The second is to pursue glycomics investigations in situations in which it may not be essential to define structures fully, and high-throughput glycomic profiling or mass-mapping procedures in combination with specific glycosylhydrolases can be exploited (Chapter 51). NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of full de novo structural characterization of isolated glycans and simple glycan mixtures. Among its several advantages are its broad applicability (glycans contain an abundance of hydrogen (1H), the most easily detected magnetic nucleus), its nondestructive nature, the quantitative relationship between resonance intensity and residue concentration, the diverse set of experiments available, and the ability to return information on primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Its principal limitation is sensitivity, typically requiring several nanomoles of glycan for even the simplest structure determination. Other limitations for both structural and metabolic applications are the relatively high cost of spectrometers and the level of expertise required for acquiring and interpreting NMR spectra.'

 'MS has inherent challenges because of the isomeric and sometimes isobaric nature of the constituent monosaccharide units that form multiple glycan isomers exhibiting the same molecular mass. Determining the molecular masses of glycans using MALDI- or ESI-MS gives a picture of the molecular distribution of glycans and allows a quantitative comparison of glycosylation between samples (Chapter 50). The limited number of masses of the monosaccharide units (Table 51.1) makes combinatorial translation of molecular ion masses to monosaccharide composition possible albeit often with some remaining ambiguity. There are available search engines that can provide a suggested list of glycan compositions based on an experimentally determined mass (e.g., GlycoMod; Chapter 52). MS alone, however, cannot distinguish between isomeric monosaccharides, so a nomenclature for generic monosaccharide compositions has been adopted. For instance, all of the isomeric 6-carbon-containing monosaccharides, such as glucose, mannose, and galactose are given the unifying name of hexose (Hex) (Table 51.1). Families of common monosaccharides found in mammalian N- and O-linked glycans  Elucidation of variable linkage configurations, and glycan branch points is another analytical challenge. Generic glycomic workflows using all the derivatization approaches described above have been developed for MS analysis. Both the neutral and sialylated glycans in a sample can be analyzed after permethylation and MALDI-MS, in which glycan masses are detected as their singly charged alkali ion adducts in positive ion mode (e.g., as [M+Na]+ ions or [M+K]+ ions). Negative ion ESI-MS is widely adopted for intact glycan profiling in their alditol form, in which both neutral and sialylated glycans are detected as deprotonated [M-nH]n− ions. The number of charges (n) will increase with the size of the glycan and is also dependent on the number of acidic moieties present (e.g., sialic acids, sulfates, and phosphates). Positive ion MALDI-MS without permethylation usually requires that sialic acid residues are derivatized as described above to prevent their loss in-source. To obtain orthogonal separations prior to the mass analysis, ESI-MS is often connected to HPLC. HILIC columns can be used for separation of reducing end derivatized glycans and provides separation based on hydrophilicity (which correlates with the glycan size), with some isomeric structure resolution (Figures 51.1 and 51.2). The retention of glycans on such columns is primarily based on hydrogen bonding to water surrounding the HILIC stationary phase (partitioning). Using an alternate stationary phase, porous graphitized carbon (PGC) has shown a unique ability to clearly separate isomers of released glycan alditols based on more complex retention mechanisms. If glycans are permethylated, the increased hydrophobicity allows separation using conventional C18 reversed-phase chromatography. Ion mobility has also been utilized to resolve glycan isomers entering the mass spectrometer. Data from two or more approaches can be used to give confidence in structural assignments and can be facilitated by software that allows automated data analysis (Chapter 52). MS fragmentation has become the gold standard for glycan structural characterization. The goal is to generate information-rich fragment spectra that will allow unequivocal assignment of a glycan structure. However, in the current state of the art, fragments from colliding glycan molecular ions (collision-induced dissociation [CID]—either “beam-type” or “ion trap-type”) can only partly determine the structure of interest. We can distinguish three types of glycan fragment ions depending on the type and amount of information they carry (Figure 51.3). Collision-induced dissociation–tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) of released N-glycans. (A) MS of released N-glycans: Masses are shown as doubly charged ions with corresponding monosaccharide compositions.'
 'Its principal limitation is sensitivity, typically requiring several nanomoles of glycan for even the simplest structure determination. Other limitations for both structural and metabolic applications are the relatively high cost of spectrometers and the level of expertise required for acquiring and interpreting NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there are emerging experiments using methods, such as dynamic nuclear polarization and looped, projected spectroscopy (L-PROSY), that provide several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for applications that can monitor rapid in vivo conversions of metabolites such as glucose and fructose. Diffusion-based methods can also yield spectra of mixtures of components, separated by diffusion constants (effective molecular size). When small amounts of sample are available and the source of the sample is known, the acquisition of a 1D 1H NMR spectrum, combined with simple 2D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), can frequently identify a glycan. A 1D 1H NMR spectrum can be collected on ∼30 µg of a decasaccharide in ∼20 min on a state-of-the-art spectrometer (900 MHz with a cryoprobe). The anomeric 1H resonances are usually well-resolved in a relatively noncrowded region of the spectrum and show characteristic scalar couplings that are small for most α anomers and significantly larger for most β anomers. Thus, a first glance at the 1H -NMR spectrum gives a good estimate of how many residues there are (one anomeric 1H per residue except for Sia and KDOs) in a given oligosaccharide and how many of them belong to each anomeric type. NMR also provides a good estimate of how many residues are in a repeating unit of a polysaccharide. Connections from the anomeric (H1) resonances to the H2 and subsequently other resonances of a scalar coupled spin system can usually be seen in 2D TOCSY data, which show chemical shifts (resonance positions) for coupled 1Hs as crosspeaks on columns or rows emanating from an anomeric resonance (a ∼12-h acquisition for a 30-µg sample). The chemical shifts of two or more connected 1Hs are often sufficient to identify a residue. For example, the downfield (higher ppm) position and small couplings of three H2 resonances connected by crosspeaks to three α-anomeric resonances can identify these as belonging to core Man residues of an N-glycan. Historically, a collection of easily resolved resonances, often from 1D spectra, sensitive to both monosaccharide type and linkage type, were called reporter group resonances. These often prove sufficient to identify a glycan, particularly when options are restricted by knowledge of biosynthetic pathways in the system under study. Today, it is possible to greatly extend glycan identification by including 13C chemical shifts correlated with directly bonded 1Hs using 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (Figure. 50.3). 13C is magnetically active, but 13C spectroscopy is less sensitive than 1H spectroscopy. To improve sensitivity, 13C chemical shifts are indirectly detected through 1Hs. Even with the improved detection, 13C is only 1% naturally abundant, and unless the sample is isotopically enriched, approximately two orders of magnitude more material is required for collection of these data. Improvements in NMR hardware can reduce the quantities or time required and allow hybrid experiments, such as 2D HSQC-TOCSY, also illustrated in Figure 50.3. Furthermore, significant spectral overlap can be overcome with recent 2D NMR experiments optimized by using direct detection on 13C combined with optimized data processing. Web-based computational tools that rely on empirical rules or databases that correlate chemical shifts with structural features now exist, and these allow facile prediction of possible structures from 1D and 2D NMR data (e.g., CASPER).

 'The Glycosciences.de portal started a toolset for analyzing and interpreting experimental data, and a decade later, the EUROCarbDB initiative launched GlycoWorkbench as a freely downloadable software tool to assist the interpretation of MS/MS data by matching a theoretical list of fragment masses against the experimental peak list derived from the mass spectrum. This tool has been integrated into several glycomics resources as it provides an easy-to-use interface, a comprehensive collection of fragmentation types, and a list of annotation options. UniCarb-DB adopts the approach of storing annotated and curated experimental glycan MS/MS data against which spectral matching can be used to identify unknown structures. RINGS provides Web-based software (Glycan Miner Tool, ProfilePSTMM) to analyze distinguishable glycan fragments from glycan profiling (MS) data, and the GlycomeAtlas tool is a visualization tool for glycan profiling data in mouse and human, where the distribution of glycans across various tissues is visualized. The GRITS toolbox is also a freely available integrated environment for processing glycoanalytic data. It uses a plug-in approach to facilitate reuse and integration of data-processing modules. GRITS includes a module called GELATO for collecting, annotating, and comparing mass spectral data, manipulating the corresponding metadata, and generating reports. This also uses libraries from GlycoWorkBench. With recent advances in high-accuracy, high-throughput mass spectrometers (Chapter 51), glycoinformatics tools have emerged (and continue to emerge and be improved) to analyze these data both for glycomics and glycoproteomics applications (Table 52.2). Despite the rapid speed of these glycoinformatics tools, the analysis may only reveal partial glycan structure information as it is challenging to determine glycosidic bond linkage type and position using MS/MS data alone, particularly in the absence of standards. To alleviate these problems in glycomics analysis, glycan spectral library data repositories have been established by various resources including NIST and UniCarb-DR, and their integration into computational programs is awaited. From the biological perspective, however, even partial information is helpful as it enables comparative glycomics analysis of different healthy and disease tissues. Similar approaches have also been undertaken in the field of glycoproteomics, in which glycoproteins and glycopeptides are analyzed in their native form, with glycans attached to them, using MS techniques (Figure 52.1; Chapter 51). Glycoproteomics not only allows the identification of the glycoprotein and the sites of the attached glycans, but can also provide some specific microheterogeneity information on the glycan compositions. Different fragmentation methods (electron transfer dissociation [ETD], collision-induced dissociation [CID], and higher-energy collision dissociation [HCD]) each provide distinct information about some different structural features of glycoproteins. More recently both stepped-energy HCD, and ETD supplementation with HCD (EThcD) have emerged as powerful strategies for revealing both the composition of the attached glycans and the sites of glycosylation. The application of multiple fragmentation modes to a single candidate glycopeptide sets the stage for the development of glycoinformatics tools that may reveal some information on the attached glycan structure (in addition to composition) at specific sites. The mass spectrum matching algorithms used in these programs vary widely (e.g., database search, de novo sequencing/open-glycan searching, or spectral library matching) to identify specific spectral fragment masses and thereby assign glycan/glycopeptide structural features. Following the ability now to obtain large data sets on glycopeptides generated from complex mixtures of glycoproteins (Chapter 51), a bottleneck that has severely limited the field of glycoproteomics is the downstream glycopeptide structural identification. The identification process was, until recently, largely driven by manual expert annotation of the resulting MS/MS spectra. However, many glycoinformatics initiatives are under continuing development to automate this glycopeptide identification process using various strategies to identify intact glycopeptides by using characteristic fragment ions. Several software tools are freely available to address the challenge of analyzing glycoproteomics data, such as pGlyco, GlycoPAT, MSFragger-Glyco, GlycReSoft, GP Finder, IQ-GPA, O-Pair, and GPQuest.']","The computational methods available for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data include GlycoMod, CASPER, and web-based tools that rely on empirical rules or databases correlating chemical shifts with structural features.

Since different glycan structures can result in the same mass, structural isomers are routinely separated via liquid chromatography (LC), followed by fragmentation into smaller substructures by MS, conceptually akin to shotgun sequencing. Current in-depth workflows are hard to parallelize, with a general trade-off between resolution and scale. All this has relegated structural glycomics to a few experts, inaccessible to most life science researchers. Nuances of diagnostic indicators are challenging for humans to decrypt manually or encode programmatically, especially at scale and while accommodating diverse experimental setups, as each linkage and monosaccharide can be affected by its sequence context.",1.0,0.9399751460921171,0.7278685173562982,0.024390243902439025,0.99999999998,1.0
"What are the structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines, and how does this binding regulate cellular signaling pathways?","['Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an ER-associated negative regulator of innate immunity. Mutations that affect TREX1 function are associated with numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Chapter 45). The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation. The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies. Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter. It is not known if these free glycans have any signaling functions in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment. In the lysosome, glycosidases hydrolyze the glycans into monomeric sugars that can then be reused by the cell. Mutations that disrupt NGLY1 function may cause severe health problems in humans. Studies with Ngly1 mutant mice cells suggest that in the absence of NGLY1, ERAD becomes dysfunctional because a cytosolic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase generates proteins that contain only a single Asn-linked GlcNAc instead of completely deglycosylated proteins. The accumulation of these GlcNAc-proteins may result in the formation of aggregates that are harmful to the cell or they may interfere with intracellular signaling processes. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are signaling glycans because they interact with receptor tyrosine kinases and/or their ligands and facilitate changes in cell behavior (Chapters 16, 17, and 38). Hyaluronan oligosaccharides bind to specific membrane proteins, including CD44. In some cells, this binding leads to clustering of CD44, which activates kinases such as c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 with regulatory and adaptor molecules that modulate cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell survival and proliferation (Figure 16.6). Signaling by hyaluronan oligosaccharides depends on the DP of the glycans. Low molecular weight glycans are more active in triggering danger responses via binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In contrast to hyaluronan-dependent signal transduction, signaling via sulfated GAGs such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate occurs by an indirect mechanism. Indeed, few membrane receptors have been described in which sulfated GAGs binding causes a specific downstream response, such as phosphorylation of the receptor or activation of a kinase. Instead, sulfated GAGs bind to many ligand/receptor pairs, thereby lowering the effective concentration of ligand required to engage the receptor or increasing the duration of the response. An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.38 Ding Xu, James H. Prestegard, Robert J. Linhardt, and Jeffrey D. Esko. Glycosaminoglycans bind to many different classes of proteins mostly through electrostatic interactions between negatively charged sulfate groups and uronic acids and positively charged amino acids in the protein. This chapter focuses on examples of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins, methods for measuring GAG–protein interaction, and information about three-dimensional structures of the complexes. In contrast to lectins, which tend to fall into evolutionarily conserved families (Chapters 28–37), GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds and instead appear to have evolved by convergent evolution. Several hundred GAG-binding proteins have been discovered, which make up the GAG-interactome and fall into the broad classes presented in Table 38.1. To a large extent, studies of the GAG-interactome have focused on protein interactions with heparin, a more highly sulfated, iduronic acid (IdoA)-rich form of heparan sulfate (HS; Chapter 17). This bias reflects, in part, the commercial availability of heparin and heparin-Sepharose, which are frequently used for fractionation studies, and the partially incorrect assumption that binding to heparin mimics binding to HS present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. There are also a large number of proteins known to interact with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) with comparable avidity and affinity; there are fewer examples of specific interactions with keratan sulfate (KS), but this may reflect fewer studies of KS. In some cases, CS may be the physiologically relevant ligand because CS predominates in many tissues. Determining the physiological relevance of these interactions is a major area of research. Examples of various classes of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins  Interactions between GAGs and proteins can have profound physiological effects on processes such as hemostasis, lipid transport and absorption, cell growth and migration, and development. Binding to GAGs can result in immobilization of proteins at their sites of production or in the extracellular matrix for future mobilization, regulation of enzyme activity, binding of proteins to their receptors, protein oligomerization, and protection of proteins against degradation. Several viruses and bacteria also exploit GAGs expressed in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces as attachment factors. For example, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, enters through the respiratory tract and infects epithelial cells lining the airways by interactions of the viral spike protein with heparan sulfate. The ability of virions to attach to cell-surface heparan sulfate facilitates capture of the virus and transfer to proteinaceous receptors (e.g., host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in the case of SARS-CoV-2) as well as subsequent viral glycoprotein processing and infection. The interactions of GAG-binding proteins are often driven by a general complementarity of charge (e.g., thrombin–heparin interactions). In some cases, the interaction has been shown to depend on rare but specific sequences of modified sugars in the GAG chain (e.g., antithrombin binding). Numerous methods are available for analyzing GAG–protein interactions, and some provide a direct measurement of Kd values. A common method involves affinity fractionation of proteins on Sepharose columns containing covalently linked GAG chains, usually heparin. The bound proteins are eluted with different concentrations of sodium chloride, and the concentration required for elution is generally proportional to the Kd. High-affinity interactions require 0.5–2 m NaCl to displace bound ligand, which usually translates into Kd values of 10−7–10−9 m (determined under physiological salt concentrations by equilibrium binding).'
 'Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins. With more than 500 GAG-binding proteins already identified (and still counting), we cannot help contemplating how this huge GAG interactome really functions at the system level. It is obvious that in any cellular environment, if one GAG-binding protein is found, it is likely that many more GAG-binding proteins are present as well. Do these GAG-binding proteins live in harmony, or are they in constant conflict by competing for binding to GAGs? When one GAG-binding protein is down-regulated, how would other GAG-binding proteins respond to this sudden availability of the free GAG-binding sites? Addressing these questions requires a systems biology approach, which has become possible with the recent increase in information about individual GAG–protein interactions. Given that spatiotemporal changes of GAG structure have profound impacts on the physiological processes associated with GAG-binding proteins, it would be natural to study this question using a systems biology approach. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Ryan Porell, Ulf Lindahl, and So Young Kim.'
 'The heparin fragment ([GlcNS6Sα1-4IdoA2Sα1-4]3) was helical and bound to a turn-rich heparin-binding site on the surface of FGF2. Only one N-sulfo group and the 2-O-sulfo group from the adjacent iduronic acid are bound to the growth factor in the turn-rich binding domain, and the next GlcNS residue is bound to a second site, consistent with the minimal binding sequence determined with oligosaccharide fragments. Unlike antithrombin–heparin interaction, no significant conformational change in FGF2 occurs on heparin binding. The crystal structure of acidic FGF (FGF1) has also been solved and shows similar sequences on its surface. However, the oligosaccharide sequence that binds with high affinity to FGF1 contains 6-O-sulfo groups. Crystal and solution structures of GAG–protein complexes. (A) Crystal structure of the FGF2–hexasaccharide complex (PDB: 1BFC). Key interactions between the hexasaccharide and FGF2 are shown in black dotted lines. The hexasaccharide is (more...) The cocrystal structure of the complex of (FGF2-FGFR)2, first solved in the absence of heparin/HS ligand, showed a canyon of positively charged amino acid residues, suggestive of an unoccupied heparin-binding site. Subsequently, the heparin–oligosaccharide-containing complex was solved after introduction of heparin oligosaccharides, suggesting a 2:2:2 complex of FGF2:FGFR1:HS (Figure 38.3). Another important feature of this complex is the orientation of the nonreducing ends of the HS chains that terminate in an N-sulfoglucosamine residue, which arises by endolytic cleavage of chains by the enzyme heparanase (Chapter 17). The structure of the FGF1–FGFR2–HS complex is not without controversy; structural analysis of complexes formed in solution and purified by gel filtration has suggested a very different structure consisting of a 2:2:1 complex (Figure 38.3). Chemokines are another class of proteins exhibiting strong interactions with GAGs. However, these interactions do not directly affect activities of inhibitors or signaling molecules as in previous examples. Instead, they stabilize chemotactic gradients of chemokines; these gradients, in turn, direct leukocytes to sites of injury or infection. They may also facilitate cell migration through the endothelial layer of the blood vessels in which they circulate. This is no easy task; blood is flowing rapidly in these vessels and would easily destroy gradients in the absence of these interactions. CCL5, also called RANTES, is a member of a chemokine subclass that has two adjacent cysteines (CC) near its amino terminus. It is among the earliest discovered and among the most studied of the chemokines. CCL5 binds both HS and CS; but given the abundance of CS chains in normal plasma and the association of CS proteoglycans with vascular development and disease, a specific discussion of CCL5–CS interactions seems appropriate. Although CCL5 is a small protein (∼8 kDa), it exists primarily as dimers (Kd<1 µM) that assemble into larger filamentous structures, especially in the presence of GAGs. These characteristics have made it difficult to study CCL5 structurally. Most studies have involved a mutated form (E66S) and/or study at lower pH—conditions that limit oligomerization to a dimer. Nevertheless, complementary solution data, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have allowed construction of filament models, both with and without GAGs present. Figure 38.3D shows a model of a tetramer built on the known dimer structure (PDB id, 1U4L) and complexed with CS hexamers 4-O-sulfated on all three N-acetylgalactosamine residues of the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc repeats. Individual dimers are shown as green and sea green ribbons.'
 'Figure 38.3D shows a model of a tetramer built on the known dimer structure (PDB id, 1U4L) and complexed with CS hexamers 4-O-sulfated on all three N-acetylgalactosamine residues of the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc repeats. Individual dimers are shown as green and sea green ribbons. Additional dimers can be added to each end to build a filament structure. The interactions between protein residues and charged groups on the CS involve a classic BBXB motif (R44, K45, N46, R47) plus a more remote arginine (R17). Each positively charged arginine is positioned to have strong electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the negatively charged carboxylate of a glucuronic acid residue and 4-O-sulfo group of the following N-acetylgalactosamine residue. The positioning of these arginine residues may be unique to CS, and other GAG segments may bind quite differently. The model of the filament in Figure 38.3D is also not unique, and both positioning of dimeric subunits and flexibility in CS binding geometry may allow longer GAG chains to cross-link adjacent dimers and facilitate oligomerization. A final point of note is that the groups responsible for interaction with the CCR5 receptor on leukocytes are near the amino terminus, a segment deeply buried in the dimer interface. These groups may be transiently exposed on filament dissociation to release monomers or they may be more permanently exposed on filament ends. Much additional structural work will be required to fully understand the function of CCL5. In some cases, the interaction of GAG chains with proteins may depend on metal cofactors. For example, L- and P-selectins have been shown to bind to a subfraction of HS chains and heparin in a divalent-cation-dependent manner. This observation raises the possibility that other examples of cation-dependent interactions with GAG chains may exist. Indeed, annexin A2 and annexin V have been shown to bind HS in a calcium-dependent manner. The co-crystal structures of annexin A2 and annexin V with heparin oligosaccharides revealed that calcium ions can either directly or indirectly (through sequestered water) participate in the interactions with HS. Another example is calcium-dependent interaction between cytokine S100A12 and HS. In this case, formation of the functional HS-binding site requires a calcium-induced conformational change of S100A12. Although the vast majority of GAG–protein interactions were identified and studied under neutral pH, quite a few GAG-binding proteins have been shown to interact with GAG only under acidic pH. Such proteins include histidine-rich glycoproteins, cystatin-C, selenoprotein P, and serum amyloid A. There is good reason to believe that the interactions between these proteins and GAG are physiologically relevant because extracellular environments with acidic pH exist under many physiological and pathological conditions. In fact, for these proteins, pH change essentially functions as an on/off switch of their interactions with GAG, which might bear physiological significances. Not surprisingly, histidines are often found in the GAG-binding site of these proteins because of its pH-dependent protonation of the imidazole ring. A main technical challenge to understand GAG–protein interactions is to dissect the essential structural elements of GAGs that contribute to the binding. Unlike researchers studying DNA-binding proteins who have access to all possible DNA sequences, researchers studying GAG-binding proteins traditionally do not have access to GAG oligosaccharides with defined structures. Fortunately, this situation has begun to change in the last 5 years. With the rapid progress of chemoenzymatic and chemical synthesis (or a combination of both) of HS/CS oligosaccharides, a growing number of structural defined oligosaccharides (dp4-dp20) have become available. Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins.']","The structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines involve interactions between negatively charged sulfate groups and uronic acids in the GAG chain with positively charged amino acids in the proteins. These interactions are primarily electrostatic in nature. Specific sequences of modified sugars in the GAG chain can also play a role in binding to proteins. The binding of GAGs to growth factors and cytokines can regulate cellular signaling pathways by stabilizing chemotactic gradients, facilitating cell migration, directing leukocytes to sites of injury or infection, and modulating activities of inhibitors or signaling molecules. Additionally, the interactions between GAG chains and proteins may depend on metal cofactors, such as calcium ions, which can participate in the binding interactions. The pH of the extracellular environment can also influence the binding of certain proteins to GAGs, acting as an on/off switch for their interactions.","In general, the biological activity and binding affinity of GAGs is dictated by their sulfation pattern, disaccharide unit sequence and 3D conformation; however, GAGs are also capable of unspecific binding of other positively charged proteins due to the negative charge provided by their numerous sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. Many proteins also contain specific evolutionarily conserved GAG-binding domains that mediate specific protein-GAG interactions. These domains often contain basic amino acids with small polar side chains (i.e. lysine and arginine), allowing flexibility and minimal steric hindrance for interaction with GAGs.",1.0,0.939794457191815,0.8182283453344714,0.02586206896551724,0.99999999998,0.25
"How does glycosylation impact the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, such as folding, stability, and oligomerization, and what are the implications for drug targeting?","[""In addition, substantial evidence supports the role of glycosyltransferase cytoplasmic tails in enzyme retrograde transport and Golgi localization (see below). The length and hydrophobicity of a membrane protein's TM region determine its ability to partition into membrane microdomains and are now appreciated to be involved in membrane protein trafficking and localization throughout the cell. Both the concentration of cholesterol and the width of the membrane increase throughout the secretory pathway with the widest, most cholesterol-rich membranes found at the cell surface. Experiments using cholesterol-containing model membranes showed that shorter TM peptides partition into thinner membranes, whereas longer TM peptides partition into thicker membranes. It is possible that cholesterol's tendency to “straighten” the lipid acyl chains may make it more energetically difficult to partition TM peptides into membranes with mismatched thicknesses. In support of the idea that membrane thickness may contribute to membrane protein localization in the secretory pathway, it has been noted that ER proteins have shorter TM regions than plasma membrane proteins, and that the TM regions of Golgi enzymes are intermediate between those of ER and plasma membrane proteins. However, among the Golgi enzymes there is not a strict increase in TM length as one moves from the cis to the trans face of the organelle. One possibility is that the relative impact of TM region length on cisternal localization depends on what other sequences and mechanisms are involved in the localization of a specific enzyme. Nevertheless, at minimum, the shorter TM regions of Golgi enzymes may prevent these proteins from leaving the Golgi system by reducing their ability to partition to the thicker, cholesterol-rich membranes of carriers destined for post-Golgi compartments like the plasma membrane (Figure 4.2). Another mechanism contributing to Golgi localization of enzymes is their ability to form oligomeric complexes (Figure 4.2). Nearly all enzymes in the N-linked and O-linked glycosylation pathways form homodimers, and many also form heteromeric complexes. In some cases, heteromeric complex formation is pH dependent. Heteromeric complex formation is observed between enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions in the same pathway and that are localized in the same cisternae. For example, in the N-glycosylation pathway, complexes are formed between two N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GlcNAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II) in the medial-Golgi and between GalT-I and ST6Gal-I in the trans-Golgi. Notably, enzymes not in the same pathway (e.g., O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation enzymes) and enzymes in the same pathway, but that catalyze competing or nonsequential events, do not form heteromeric complexes even if they are localized in the same cisterna. Complexes between sequential enzymes in a pathway could increase the efficiency of glycosylation by promoting substrate channeling, wherein one enzyme hands the newly modified substrate off to the next enzyme in the pathway. Taken together, evidence indicates that glycosylation enzymes use multiple mechanisms to maintain their Golgi localization. The number of signals and mechanisms used by an enzyme could determine how stable its Golgi localization is, whether it is able to move to a later compartment, and whether it is cleaved and secreted into the extracellular space. There are scattered reports of glycosylation in unexpected locations—for example, gangliosides in mitochondria and GAGs and N-glycans in the nucleus. Many of these claims are based on incomplete evidence (Chapter 18). One possibility is that there are indeed glycans in these unexpected locations, but that their true structures are novel. Conversely, although structural evidence might be strong, there may be inadequate evidence to be certain about the topology of the claimed structures. Regardless, past experience tells us that the cell biology of glycosylation can hold many surprises, and dogmatic positions about such controversial issues are not warranted. Like all components of living cells, glycans constantly turn over. Some glycoconjugates, such as transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, turn over by shedding from the cell surface through limited proteolysis. Most glycoconjugate turnover occurs by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Endoglycosidases can initially cleave glycans internally, producing substrates for exoglycosidases in the lysosome.""

N-Glycans affect glycoprotein folding because of their hydrophilic nature. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the processing of N-glycans yields a series of truncated N-glycans that serve as checkpoints that dictate the life or death of many newly made membrane and secreted proteins. Other glycan modifications also may affect glycoprotein folding in the ER. This chapter describes glycan-mediated quality-control processes in the ER and Golgi apparatus and what happens to glycoproteins that fail their “final folding examination.” During protein synthesis, nascent polypeptides begin to assume their final three-dimensional conformation by passing through folding intermediates dictated, to a large extent, by their primary sequence. Proper folding involves the formation of secondary structures (α-helices and β-strands), burying of hydrophobic residues in the interior of the protein, the formation of disulfide bonds, and quaternary associations via oligomerization or multimerization. Together, these processes prevent unwanted protein aggregation that would interfere with protein functions. To make folding more efficient, cells use various chaperones. Two major cytoplasmic chaperone families consist of heat-shock proteins in the hsp60 and hsp70 gene families that bind to exposed hydrophobic domains on misfolded proteins and maintain their solubility as they acquire their final conformation. They also participate in the repair of damaged proteins and proteins that have not properly multimerized. Improperly folded proteins that fail to mature are eventually tagged by ubiquitination, which then leads to degradation by the proteasome. Membrane proteins and proteins destined for secretion also undergo quality control during folding. Membrane and secretory proteins originate on membrane-bound ribosomes; translation and translocation into the lumen of the ER occur simultaneously in most cases. However, certain proteins are fully synthesized in the cytosol and translocated into the ER lumen posttranslationally. This latter process is more relevant in yeast than mammalian cells. The ER lumen is highly specialized for protein folding: Its oxidizing environment promotes disulfide bond formation and it is the main cellular reservoir of Ca++. To aid proper folding, a battery of molecular chaperones is present, including BiP/Grp78 (a glucose-regulated protein and member of the hsp70 family of chaperones), Grp94, and Grp170. In addition, the ER contains enzymes that promote proline cis–trans isomerization and protein disulfide bond formation, such as protein disulfide isomerases (PDI and ERp57, ERp59, and ERp72). The expression of many of these proteins increases during stress responses. Unlike cytoplasmic proteins, most membrane and secreted proteins undergo modification with N-glycans (Figure 39.1) as they enter the ER lumen. Oligosaccharyltransferase requires flexible domains of a polypeptide for glycosylation, and thus N-glycosylation evolved in eukaryotes to occur before protein folding. Accordingly, N-linked glycans affect the folding of glycoproteins directly by altering the biophysical properties of the protein. They can serve as signals to localize the folding machinery and to signal the folding status of the polypeptide. To achieve glycan-mediated folding, N-glycans are recognized by two lectin-like chaperones in the ER: calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These specialized chaperones require Ca++ for activity and bind to monoglucosylated forms of N-glycans, thus retaining the protein in the ER until proper folding occurs.'
 'The biological consequences of experimentally altering glycosylation in various systems seem to be highly variable and unpredictable. Also, a given glycan can have different roles in different tissues, at different times in development (organism-intrinsic functions) or in different environmental contexts (organism-extrinsic functions). As a broad generalization, it can be stated that terminal sequences, unusual structures, and modifications of glycans are more likely to mediate specific biological functions within the organism. However, such glycans or their modifications are also more likely to be targets for pathogens and toxins. Perhaps as a consequence, intra- and interspecies variations in glycosylation are relatively common, and at least some of the diversity of glycans in nature may represent signatures of past or current host–pathogen or symbiotic interactions (Chapter 20). Finally, genetic defects in glycosylation are easily obtained in cultured cells, but often have limited biological consequences in vitro. In contrast, the same defects often have major and even catastrophic consequences in whole organisms. This generalization indicates that many major functions of glycans are operative mainly within an intact, multicellular organism. Some of these principles are briefly discussed below. Experimental approaches to elucidating biological roles of glycans include prevention of initial glycosylation, prevention of glycan chain elongation, alteration of glycan processing, enzymatic or chemical deglycosylation of completed chains, genetic elimination of glycosylation sites, addition of unnatural monosaccharides, and studies of mutant and naturally occurring genetic variants in glycosylation enzymes. The consequences of such manipulations can range from being essentially undetectable, to the complete loss of particular functions, or even to loss of the entire glycoconjugate bearing the altered glycan. Even within a particular class of molecules (e.g., cell-surface receptors), the effects of altering glycosylation are variable and unpredictable. Moreover, the same glycosylation change can have markedly different effects in different cell types or when studied in vivo or in vitro. The effect may depend on the structure of the glycan, the biological context (including interactions with cognate glycan receptors), GBPs, and the specific biological function. Given all of the above considerations, it is difficult to predict the functions that a given glycan on a given glycoconjugate might mediate and its relative importance to the organism. Glycans have many protective, stabilizing, organizational, and barrier functions. The glycocalyx that covers all eukaryotic cells and the polysaccharide coats of various prokaryotes represent a substantial physical barrier. Cellulose provides the material for cell walls in plants, and chitin fulfills this role in fungi. Arthropods evolved resistant chitin-rich exoskeletons. Cellulose and chitin represent the two most abundant biopolymers on the planet. In multicellular organisms, glycan constituents of matrix molecules, such as proteoglycans, are important for maintenance of tissue structure, porosity, and integrity. Such molecules can also contain binding sites for other specific glycans, which, in turn, aid overall matrix organization. The external location of glycans on most glycoproteins can provide a general shield, protecting the underlying polypeptide from recognition by proteases (mucins), blocking antibody binding (viral glycoproteins), and even (as in the case of mucins) protecting entire tissue surfaces from microbial attachment. Another structural role of glycans is their involvement in folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or in the subsequent maintenance of protein solubility and conformation (Chapter 39). Indeed, when some proteins are incorrectly glycosylated, they can fail to fold properly and/or to exit the ER. Such misfolded glycoproteins are translocated to the cytoplasm for degradation in proteasomes. Conversely, there are examples of glycoproteins whose synthesis, folding, trafficking, sensitivity to proteolysis, or immune recognition seem unaffected by altering their glycosylation. Moreover, inhibitors (Chapter 55) or genetic mutations (Chapter 45) that only affect later steps of glycan processing often do not interfere with basic structural functions. Although structural functions of glycans are obviously of great importance to the intact organism, they do not explain the evolution of such a diverse and complex range of molecules.'
 'dollars annually worldwide. Therapeutic glycoproteins or glycan-processing/recognizing proteins are typically produced recombinantly in cell culture systems or, less commonly, in the milk of transgenic animals. Control of glycosylation is of major importance during the development of these drugs, because their glycan chains have marked effects on stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics in intact organisms. Frequently, glycosylation must be optimized to ensure prolonged circulatory half-life in the blood. Manipulation of glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues and cell types has also been a useful element of drug design. Erythropoietin (EPO) is the most successful biotechnology product to date. It is a circulating cytokine that binds to the erythropoietin receptor, inducing proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. EPO was developed to treat anemias caused by bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy or lack of erythropoietin (e.g., renal failure). Natural and recombinant forms of erythropoietin carry three sialylated complex N-glycans and one sialylated O-glycan. Although in vitro the activity of deglycosylated erythropoietin is comparable to that of the fully glycosylated molecule, its activity in vivo is reduced by ∼90%, because poorly glycosylated EPO is rapidly cleared by filtration in the kidney. Undersialylated EPO is also rapidly cleared by galactose receptors in hepatocytes and macrophages (see Chapter 31). Fully sialylated chains and increased tetra-antennary branching reduce these problems and increase EPO activity in vivo nearly tenfold. Addition of an N-glycosylation site also increases half-life and activity in vivo. Covalently linking polyethylene glycol to the protein also reduces clearance by the kidney. Erythropoietin is unusual because it is small enough to be cleared by the kidney if it is underglycosylated. For most glycoprotein therapeutics, a more important consideration is minimizing clearance by galactose-binding hepatic receptors by ensuring full sialylation of glycans. Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation. Sialidases and other glycosidases that are either secreted or released by dead cells can also degrade the previously intact product in the culture medium. These issues were hotly debated with the advent of “biosimilars” or generic versions of glycoproteins. The need to prove composition has fueled efforts devoted to glycan analysis and sequencing. Patenting new therapeutics is typically based on the composition of matter in the claimed molecule. Small molecules of defined structure and nonglycosylated proteins are easily captured in this manner. However, glycoproteins, especially those with multiple glycosylation sites, render it virtually impossible to obtain preparations that contain only a single glycoform. For examples of glycosylated therapeutics, please see Table 57.1. Thus, most biotherapeutic glycoproteins consist of a mixture of glycoforms. Licensing bodies allow for a certain range of variation in glycoforms and complexity of the mixture. However, the manufacturer and the agency must agree on the extent such variation is acceptable for a given drug formulation. Biopharmaceutical companies therefore spend considerable effort in assuring that their products fall within these defined ranges, once these are approved by licensing bodies. The inherent difficulty in reproducing complex glycoform mixtures also complicates efforts to make generic forms of recombinant glycoprotein drugs. Given the complexities of producing glycotherapeutic agents in mammalian cells, licensing agencies use consistency in glycoform composition as an indirect measure of the quality of process control in production. Glycosylation differences can have implications for the patentability of agents in which the polypeptide remains constant. Marked glycosylation differences have been used to define agents as being unique.'
 'The diverse functions ascribed to glycans can be simply divided into two general categories: (i) structural and modulatory functions (involving the glycans themselves or their modulation of the molecules to which they are attached) and (ii) specific recognition of glycans by glycan-binding proteins. Of course, any given glycan can mediate one or both types of functions. The binding proteins in turn fall into two broad groups: lectins and sulfated GAG-binding proteins (Chapters 27, 28, and 38). Such molecules can be either intrinsic to the organism that synthesized the cognate glycans (e.g., see Chapters 31–36, 38, and 39) or extrinsic (see Chapters 37 and 42 for information concerning microbial proteins that bind to specific glycans on host cells). The atomic details of these glycan–protein interactions have been elucidated in many instances (Chapters 29 and 30). Although there are exceptions to this notion, the following general theme has emerged regarding lectins: monovalent binding tends to be of relatively low affinity, and such systems typically achieve their specificity and function by achieving high avidity, via interactions of multivalent arrays of glycans with cognate lectin-binding sites. Whenever a new tool (e.g., an antibody or lectin) specific for detecting a particular glycan is developed and used to probe its expression in intact organisms, it is common to find exquisitely specific temporal and spatial patterns of expression of that glycan in relation to cellular activation, embryonic development, organogenesis, and differentiation (see Chapter 41 for examples). Certain relatively specific changes in expression of glycans are also often found in the course of transformation and progression to malignancy (Chapter 47), as well as other pathological situations such as inflammation (Chapter 46). These spatially and temporally controlled patterns of glycan expression imply the involvement of glycans in many normal and pathological processes, the precise mechanisms of which are understood in only some cases. Remarkably little is still known about the evolution of glycosylation. There are clearly shared and unique features of glycosylation in different kingdoms and taxa. Among animals, there may be a trend toward increasing complexity of N- and O-glycans in more recently evolved (“higher”) taxa. Intraspecies and interspecies variations in glycosylation are also relatively common. It has been suggested that the more specific biological roles of glycans are often mediated by uncommon structures, unusual presentations of common structures, or further modifications of the commonly occurring saccharides themselves. Such unusual structures likely result from unique expression patterns of the relevant glycosyltransferases or other glycan-modifying enzymes. On the other hand, such uncommon glycans can be targets for specific recognition by infectious microorganisms and various toxins. Thus, at least some of the diversity in glycan expression in nature must be related to the evolutionary selection pressures generated by interspecies interactions (e.g., of host with pathogen or symbiont). In other words, the two different classes of glycan recognition mentioned above (mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-binding proteins) are in competition with each other with regard to a particular glycan target. The specialized glycans expressed by parasites and microbes that are of great interest from the biomedical point of view (Chapters 21, 22, 23, and 43) may themselves be subject to evolutionary selection pressures. These issues are further considered in Chapter 20, which also discusses the limited information concerning how various glycan biosynthetic pathways appear to have evolved and diverged in different life-forms. Numerous natural bioactive molecules are glycoconjugates, and the attached glycans can have dramatic effects on the biosynthesis, stability, action, and turnover of these molecules in intact organisms. For example, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin and its derivatives are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. The aminoglycoside antibiotics all have carbohydrate components essential for activity. For this and many other reasons, glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have become increasingly important in modern biotechnology. Patenting a glycoprotein drug, obtaining FDA approval for its use, and monitoring its production all require knowledge of the structure of its glycans.']","Glycosylation impacts the biophysical properties of membrane proteins by affecting their folding, stability, and oligomerization. Specifically, N-glycans play a crucial role in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by serving as checkpoints that dictate the fate of newly made membrane and secreted proteins. The processing of N-glycans yields truncated forms that influence protein folding efficiency. Additionally, N-glycans directly alter the biophysical properties of glycoproteins, affecting their conformation and stability. In terms of oligomerization, glycosylation can promote the formation of homodimers and heteromeric complexes between enzymes in glycosylation pathways, enhancing the efficiency of glycosylation reactions.

These glycan-mediated processes have significant implications for drug targeting, especially in the development of therapeutic glycoproteins. Control of glycosylation is crucial for optimizing the stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics of glycoprotein drugs in intact organisms. Manipulating glycans can influence drug targeting to specific tissues and cell types, impacting the drug's efficacy and circulatory half-life. For example, ensuring proper glycosylation, such as sialylation and branching, can enhance the activity and in vivo performance of therapeutic glycoproteins like erythropoietin. The complexity of glycoform mixtures in glycoprotein drugs poses challenges in ensuring batch-to-batch consistency and regulatory approval, highlighting the importance of controlling glycosylation during production for successful drug development and targeting.","Glycosylation has been shown to ameliorate a multitude of pharmaceutically-relevant chemical and physical protein instabilities. Mechanistically, the different glycosylation parameters (e.g., number of glycans attached and glycan molecular size) studied so far can apparently impart different stabilization effects on the protein. While increasing the glycosylation degree apparently stabilizes the protein native state by increasing the internal non-covalent forces and rigidifying the protein structure, increasing the glycan molecular size appears to destabilize the protein unfolded state.",1.0,0.8473857295352536,0.7439479898957816,0.006711409395973154,0.99999999998,1.0
Explain the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition,"['The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells. In the embryonic state, or in other states of neural “plasticity,” polySia chains tend to be long, thereby interfering with homophilic binding (Chapter 15). There are also instances wherein functions can be tuned by glycans attached to other neighboring structures. For example, polySias of embryonic NCAM can interfere with interactions of other unrelated receptor–ligand pairs, simply by physically separating the cells. Also, tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the insulin receptors can be modulated by endogenous cell-surface gangliosides, possibly by organizing them into membrane microdomains (Chapter 11). Although the precise mechanisms of the latter effects are uncertain, specificity is implied by the requirement for a defined glycan sequence on the ganglioside. Because most of such “tuning” effects of glycans are partial, their overall importance tends to be questioned. However, the sum total of several such partial effects can result in a dramatic effects on the final biological outcome. Thus, glycosylation appears to be a mechanism for generating important functional diversity from the limited set of basic receptor–ligand interactions that are possible, when using gene products from a typical genome. Of course, as with most other glycan functions, exceptions can be found. There are many receptors whose ligand binding is independent of glycosylation and many peptide ligands whose binding and action are not obviously affected by glycosylation. Many glycans are specifically recognized and engaged by various viruses, phages, bacteria, and parasites and also targeted by many toxins (Chapter 37). Given rapid evolution of pathogens and ongoing selection, there is typically excellent recognition specificity for the sequence of the glycans involved. For example, the hemagglutinins of many viruses specifically recognize the type of host sialic acid, its modifications, and its glycosidic linkage to the underlying sugar chain. Likewise, various toxins bind with great specificity to certain gangliosides but not to the same glycan epitopes presented on proteins (Chapters 11 and 37). There is little doubt about the importance of structural specificity with respect to these functions of glycans. Indeed, some of the microbial binding proteins involved have been harnessed as molecular probes for studying the expression of their cognate glycans. However, providing such signposts to aid the success of pathogenic microorganisms has little obvious value to the organism that synthesized such glycans. To counter such deleterious consequences, some organisms have also evolved the ability to mask or modify glycans recognized by microorganisms or toxins. Meanwhile, glycan sequences on soluble glycoconjugates, such as secreted mucins, act as decoys for microorganisms and parasites. Thus, a pathogenic organism or toxin evolving to bind to mucosal cell membranes may first encounter its cognate ligand attached to a soluble mucin, which can then be washed away, removing the danger to cells underneath. In contrast, instances occur in which symbiosis is mediated by specific glycan recognition, such as some commensal bacteria in the gut lumen of animals and the bacteria involved in forming plant root nodules in nitrogen fixing legumes or mycorrhizal symbioses between trees and fungi (Chapter 40). Many pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) often consist of foreign glycans and/or glycan patterns that, on invading microbes, are recognized by innate immune cells and are detected by specific receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectins (Chapter 34). Last but not least, innate immune mechanisms are kept in check in vivo via recognition of self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs). Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43).'
 'Last but not least, innate immune mechanisms are kept in check in vivo via recognition of self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs). Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses. Perhaps not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved this state of molecular mimicry by making use of “every possible trick in the book,” including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer. In some instances, the impact of the pathogen is aggravated by autoimmune reactions, resulting from host reactions to these self-like antigens. Pathogens and parasites also engage in glycogimmickry—to cite just a few examples, the gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis induces tolerogenic states of gut immunity using a pentasaccharide called polysaccharide A, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) binding to host dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbingcnonintegrin (DC-SIGN) induces expression of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10, and helminthic parasites have evolved many ways to modulate the immune response of their hosts toward prolonged tolerance, using specific immunomodulatory glycans. Secreted and soluble milk oligosaccharides (all extensions of the disaccharide lactose) of mammals provide an example of trans-generational glycan manipulation of microbial symbionts or pathogens in the infant by maternal glycans. These glycans have potent effects by favoring symbionts and blocking pathogenic microbes (bacteria and viruses) of the infant gut. Expression of certain glycans on different glycoconjugates in different tissues at different stages of development implies diverse roles for these glycan structures within the same organism. For example, Man-6-P-containing glycans were first found on lysosomal enzymes and are involved in lysosomal trafficking (Chapter 33). However, such glycans are now known to occur on some apparently unrelated proteins, for different functional roles. Likewise, the sialylated fucosylated lactosamines critical for selectin recognition (Chapter 34) are found in a variety of unrelated cell types in mammals, and the polySia chains that play an important part in embryonic nervous system neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) function (Chapter 15) are also found on a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) (CCR7) expressed in dendritic cells, where they appear to be important for targeting of these cells to the lymph nodes. Given that glycans are added posttranslationally, these observations should not be surprising. Once a new glycan or modification has been expressed in an organism, several distinct functions could evolve independently in different tissues and at different times in development. If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species. Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20).'
 'An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase. These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix. Sulfated GAGs also facilitate the formation of morphogen gradients in tissues during early development. Because the gradient determines cell specification during development, the glycan indirectly affects signaling responses in receptive cells. These examples do not exclude the possibility that sulfated glycosaminoglycans may act as ligands and induce signaling directly (e.g., by ligating receptors). In addition to mucins (Chapter 10), the innate immune system developed early in eukaryote evolution is a first line of defense against infection by microorganisms. A key feature of this system is its ability to distinguish self from infectious nonself. In more advanced eukaryotes, this is accomplished by receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns specific to the pathogens. Many of these PAMPs are glycans located on the surfaces of the microorganism. The glycans include the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycans and techoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria (Chapters 21 and 22) and the mannans and glucans of fungi, perceived by PRRs. Just as in plants (as described above), numerous PRRs are present in mammals that recognize diverse PAMPs and induce host-defense pathways, including TLRs and mannan-binding lectin (Chapter 42). Binding of PAMPs to TLRs activates various signaling pathways that induce inflammation and antimicrobial effector responses. Some TLRs are present on antigen-presenting cells and help to activate the adaptive immune response. TLRs also respond to tissue injury via binding of released hyaluronan fragments as DAMPs (Figure 16.6). One of the best-studied models of mammal innate immunity involves the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, which has a role in causing septic shock (see Chapter 42). Lipid A (endotoxin) is the glucosamine-based phospholipid anchor of LPS responsible for activating the innate immune system. Lipid A is an excellent PAMP as its structure is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. Picomolar concentrations of lipid A are detected by TLR-4. The LPS is first opsonized and complexed with another host cell-surface protein, CD14. The binding of LPS leads to recruitment of the adaptor proteins MyD88 and IRAK. This complex initiates a signaling cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately lead to the transcription of proinflammatory genes. In contrast to PAMPs and DAMPs, inhibitory Siglec receptors (Chapter 35) on mammal innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialylated glycoconjugates as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) and dampen unwanted immune reactions against the host. Details of the sialoglycan specificity involved require further investigation, but pathogens take advantage of the system via molecular mimicry (Chapters 7 and 42). Plants also exhibit a type of innate immunity that on activation could confer resistance to pathogen attack to the entire plant. Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides effectively protected grapevine and Arabidopsis against the fungal/oomycete pathogens, whereas β-1,3-glucans improved, among others, tobacco, and grapevine protection against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens.'
 'Conversely, there are examples of glycoproteins whose synthesis, folding, trafficking, sensitivity to proteolysis, or immune recognition seem unaffected by altering their glycosylation. Moreover, inhibitors (Chapter 55) or genetic mutations (Chapter 45) that only affect later steps of glycan processing often do not interfere with basic structural functions. Although structural functions of glycans are obviously of great importance to the intact organism, they do not explain the evolution of such a diverse and complex range of molecules. A further structural function of glycans is to act as a protective storage depot (“sponge”) for biologically important molecules. For example, many heparin-binding growth factors (Chapters 17 and 38) bind glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of the extracellular matrix, adjacent to cells that need to be stimulated (e.g., in the basement membrane underlying epithelial and endothelial cells). This prevents diffusion of factors away from the site of secretion (sometimes generating morphogenic gradients), protects them from nonspecific proteolysis, prolongs their active lives, and allows them to be released under specific conditions. Likewise, GAG chains in secretory granules can bind and protect protein contents of the granule and modulate their functions. There are several other instances in which glycans act as sinks or depots for biologically important molecules, such as water, ions, and immune regulatory proteins. The asymmetry in localization of most glycans on the outer plasma membrane leaflet can contribute to a signal for the intracellular rupture of vesicles, wherein exposed glycans are detected by cytoplasmic lectins (e.g., galectins) and trigger autophagy. Polymerized glycans such as starch and cellulose (in plants) and glycogen (in animals) can serve a major role in nutrient storage and sequestration. The relative resistance to digestibility of the internal linkages of such polymers by enzymes of intrinsic or extrinsic origin determines their relative role as structural components or as a mechanism for nutrient sequestration. Flowering plants have evolved important glycan-based strategies for exploiting animal behavior by making available sucrose-rich rewards to pollinators and seed dispersers (nectar and fruit). Many animal species have secondarily evolved strategies to store collected nectar (bees and honey pot ants). Flowering plants have also evolved countless ways of storing starch and other polysaccharide nutrients in the endosperm of their seeds, as a way to give the next generation a head start. The first intrinsic animal glycan receptors (GBPs) identified in vertebrates were those mediating clearance, turnover, and intracellular trafficking of soluble blood-plasma glycoproteins (Chapters 33 and 34), specifically recognizing certain terminal or subterminal glycans on the circulating glycoprotein. However, even the most precise examples, such as the role of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes (Chapter 33), feature exceptions. For instance, Man-6-phosphorylation is not absolutely required for trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in certain cell types, nor is it operative in some “lower” eukaryotes. There are also endocytic receptors recognizing specific glycan sequences, whose functions have yet to be assigned. Several instances exist wherein free glycans can have hormone-like actions that induce specific responses in a structure-specific manner. Examples include interaction of small glycans (lipochitooligosaccharides) from bacterial and fungal symbionts with GBPs of plant roots (Chapter 40) and bioactive properties of hyaluronan fragments recognized by GBPs in mammalian systems (Chapter 16), both of which induce biological responses in a size- and structure-dependent manner. Likewise, free heparan or dermatan sulfate fragments released by certain cell types can have biological effects in situations such as wound healing. In many of these instances, the putative GBP receptors for these molecules and their precise mechanisms are still being defined. It is now clear that glycans have many specific information-bearing biological roles in cell–cell recognition and cell–matrix interactions. A well-characterized example is the selectin family of adhesion molecules.'
 'Likewise, free heparan or dermatan sulfate fragments released by certain cell types can have biological effects in situations such as wound healing. In many of these instances, the putative GBP receptors for these molecules and their precise mechanisms are still being defined. It is now clear that glycans have many specific information-bearing biological roles in cell–cell recognition and cell–matrix interactions. A well-characterized example is the selectin family of adhesion molecules. These cell-surface proteins recognize glycans on ligands and mediate critical interactions between and amongst blood cells and vascular cells in a variety of normal and pathological situations but are also involved in implantation of embryos on the endometrium (Chapter 34). Glycans and GBPs on cell surfaces can interact specifically with molecules in the matrix or even with glycans on the same cell surface (in cis). Some critical recognition sites are actually combinations of glycans and protein. For example, P-selectin recognizes the generic selectin ligand sialyl Lewis x with high affinity only in the context of the amino-terminal 13 amino acids of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which include required sulfated tyrosine residues (Chapter 34). Glycan-binding sites of cell-surface receptors like Siglecs can be masked/“blocked” by cognate glycans on the same cell surface, making them unavailable for recognition of external ligands (Chapter 35). On the other hand, some glycans can act as “biological masks,” preventing recognition of underlying residues (e.g., sialic acids can mask recognition of underlying β-galactosides by galectins or other GBPs). Carbohydrate–carbohydrate interactions can also have specific biological roles. A classic example is the species-specific interaction between marine sponges, mediated via homotypic binding of glycans on a large cell-surface glycoprotein, perhaps indicating the critical importance of glycosylation for the evolution of multicellularity. Another example is the compaction of the mouse embryo at the morula stage, which seems to be facilitated by a Lewis x–Lewis x interaction. The single-site affinities of such interactions are often weak and thus difficult to measure. However, if the molecules are present in very high copy numbers, a large number of relatively low-affinity interactions can collaborate to produce a high-avidity “Velcro” effect that is sufficient to mediate biologically relevant interactions. Glycosylation can also modulate interactions of proteins with one another. Some growth factor receptors acquire their binding abilities in a glycosylation-dependent manner while in transit through the Golgi apparatus. This may limit unwanted early interactions of a newly synthesized receptor with a growth factor that is synthesized in the same cell. Glycosylation of a polypeptide can also mediate an on–off switching effect. For example, when the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotrophin is deglycosylated, it still binds to its receptor with similar affinity, but it fails to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In most instances, the effects of glycosylation are incomplete; that is, glycosylation appears to be “tuning” a primary function of the protein rather than turning it on or off. For example, the activity of some glycosylated growth factors and hormones can be modulated over a wide range by the extent and type of their glycosylation. Otherwise identical antibodies can mediate differential effects depending on the precise structure(s) of the N-glycan in their Fc domain. This becomes particularly evident when recombinant glycoprotein molecules are produced in biotechnology, bearing different glycosylation patterns based on the evolutionary history of the cell expression system in use (bacterial, yeast, insect, nonhuman mammal, or human). The intricate modulation of Notch–ligand interactions by the Fringe glycosyltransferase, whereby cis and trans ligand interactions are tuned, is a prime example of the importance of informational content of specific glycan modification for development (Chapter 13). Another striking example is the role of polysialic acid (polySia) chains on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This adhesion receptor normally mediates homophilic binding between neuronal cells.']","Glycan shielding against immune recognition is significant as it allows pathogens to evade host immune responses by decorating themselves with glycan structures that mimic those on host cell surfaces. This molecular mimicry can block the recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and even mimic self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) of the host, all of which are successful strategies for evading immune detection and response. Pathogens have evolved various mechanisms, such as appropriating host glycans, convergent evolution towards similar biosynthetic pathways, and lateral gene transfer, to achieve this state of molecular mimicry and avoid immune detection. This glycan shielding strategy helps pathogens to persist and cause infections by camouflaging themselves from the host's immune system.","Glycan shielding is utilized by some enveloped viruses to evade immune system targeting by their host. These viruses typically adopt host gylcosylation during synthesis of the protein envelope, allowing antigens to be modified so that host antibodies are unable to recognize them, thereby preventing immune response to viral infection. As a result, some organisms develop antibodies that specifically target foreign glycoproteins in order to identify pathogens that may have adopted glycosylation patterns from another individual.",0.75,0.8909062281285016,0.8330333410343034,0.015503875968992248,0.9999999999666667,0.3333333333333333
How is hemoglobin involved in glycan biosynthesis?,"['Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water. Although not necessarily relevant for the product formation in nature (sugar hemiacetals being prone to mutarotation at physiological pH), the different mechanisms employed by “retaining glycosidases” (involvement of a covalent intermediate) and “inverting glycosidases” (no covalent intermediate involved) bears consequences for their use in glycan synthesis. The use of Leloir-type glycosyltransferases in glycan synthesis requires access to the natural donor glycosides, which are sugar nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic advantage of glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis (excellent regio- and stereoselectivity) can be offset by the limitation on the access to the required donor glycosides. However, this challenge may be overcome by in situ biosynthesis/regeneration of the consumed sugar nucleotides. The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst. The resulting trisaccharide 3 is further extended with GDP-fucose 4 as the donor and recombinant fucosyltransferase (FucT) as the catalyst to deliver allyl sialyl-Lewis x. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x. (CMP) Cytidine monophosphate, (CDP) cytidine diphosphate, (CTP) cytidine triphosphate.  In the first step of the assembly line, the expensive sugar nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, is consumed, and on transfer of the sialic acid, cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is produced. With the aid of two consecutive kinases (nucleoside monophosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase), CMP can be transformed in situ into the corresponding triphosphate (CTP), which is then condensed by the enzyme CMP-sialic acid synthetase with sialic acid to regenerate CMP-Neu5Ac 2. Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides.  The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans.  The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4).'
 'The HNK-1 epitope is present on a variety of neuronal cell glycoproteins, including NCAM, contactin, myelin-associated glycoprotein, telencephalin, L1, and P0 (the major glycoprotein of peripheral nerve myelin). There is evidence that HNK-1 can function as a ligand for laminin, L-selectin, P-selectin, and a cerebellar adhesion protein termed amphoterin. HNK-1 has also been shown to mediate homotypic adhesive interactions involving P0. HNK-1-dependent adhesive interactions have been implicated in cell migration processes involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and are proposed to participate in reinnervation of muscles by motor neurons. Phosphorylation of sugars is also important in recognition events. In mammals, the phosphorylation of Man on oligomannose N-glycans at the C-6 position of lysosomal hydrolases occurs by a phospho-GlcNAc transferase to create a GlcNAc-phospho-6-mannose diester (Chapters 9 and 33). Subsequent removal of the GlcNAc exposes monophosphoester Man-6-P for recognition of lysosomal hydrolases by the Man-6-P receptors. Interestingly, mannose-1-6-phosphate-mannose is a common modification in yeast mannans on their cell walls. Phosphorylation of the C-2 of the Xyl that initiates proteoglycan core linker synthesis is mediated by a Golgi kinase FAM20B and is essential for addition of the second Gal in the core linker GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-Ser/Thr core. The phosphate must be removed by a phosphatase, PXYLP1, before GlcA can be added to the core linker, generating the substrate for HS, CS, or DS addition. Interestingly, a GlcNAc may be added to the phosphorylated trisaccharide to block extension of the core linker glycan. This regulation by Xyl phosphorylation is essential for physiological homeostasis of proteoglycans (Chapters 17 and 41). In another example of regulation by phosphorylation, the Golgi kinase POMK phosphorylates the C-6 position of the O-Man that initiates O-mannose glycans on α-dystroglycan, and this has been shown to be essential for the subsequent action of the glycosyltransferase LARGE, which adds a polymer of -3GlcAβ1-3Xylα1- disaccharide repeats to the O-Man core (Chapters 13 and 45). The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Takashi Angata and Nicolle H. Packer.'
 'Mannose released from N-glycan processing or turnover is transported out of the cell by a hexose transporter/exchanger with little or no direct reutilization. Glycan salvage pathways are clinically exploited to mitigate the impact of certain rare congenital disorders of glycosylation that target sugar biosynthesis or transport (Chapter 45). Experimentally, salvage pathways are used to manipulate nucleotide sugar pools, to incorporate glycans with biorthogonal chemical handles (Chapter 56), and to generate metabolic glycosyltransferase inhibitors (Chapter 55). Glycogen is an immense molecule that contains up to 100,000 glucose units, arranged in Glcα1–4Glc repeating disaccharides with periodic α1–6Glc branches. It is synthesized on a cytoplasmic protein called glycogenin (Chapter 18). Glycogen is the major storage polysaccharide in animal cells, and its synthesis and degradation (glycogenolysis) are highly regulated for energy use. Glycogen is synthesized by the addition of single glucose units from UDP-Glc, and it is degraded by glycogen phosphorylase. This ATP-independent reaction forms glucose-1-P by phosphorolysis of glycogen. This substrate can be used directly to form UDP-Glc or converted to glucose-6-P for further catabolism via glycolysis or direct oxidation via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucose is the central monosaccharide in carbohydrate metabolism, and it can be converted directly or indirectly into all other sugars (Figure 5.1). Glucose is first converted to glucose-6-P by hexokinase. In the glycolytic pathway, glucose-6-P is converted to fructose-6-P by phosphoglucose isomerase or into glucose-1-P by phosphoglucomutase. Reaction of glucose-1-P with UTP by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase forms the high-energy donor UDP-Glc. The UDP-Glc pool is used to synthesize glycogen and other glucose-containing molecules such as glucosylceramide (Chapter 11) and dolichol-P-glucose, which is used in the N-linked glycan biosynthetic pathway (Chapter 9). Biosynthesis and interconversion of monosaccharides. The relative contributions of each pathway under physiological conditions are unknown. (Rectangles) donors; (ovals) monosaccharides; (asterisks) control points; (Kdn) 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic (more...) Glucose-6-phosphate is also the substrate for glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, the entry point for its oxidation via the pentose phosphate pathway that subsequently produces 6-phosphogluconate and then ribose-5-phosphate. These reactions generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is needed to maintain proper redox status. UDP-GlcA (glucuronic acid) is synthesized directly from UDP-Glc by a two-stage reaction requiring two NAD+-dependent oxidations at C-6. UDP-GlcA is used primarily for GAG biosynthesis (Chapters 16 and 17), but some N- and O-linked glycans and glycosphingolipids contain glucuronic acid as well. In liver cells, the addition of glucuronic acid to bile acids and xenobiotic compounds (such as drugs and toxins) increases their solubility, and a large class of microsomal glucuronosyltransferases is devoted to these reactions. Iduronic acid is the C-5 epimer of GlcA, and it is found in GAGs dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin. Iduronic acid is not directly synthesized from a nucleotide sugar donor. Instead, it is generated by epimerization of GlcA following its incorporation into the growing GAG chain (Chapter 17). Decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA generates UDP-Xyl, which is used to initiate GAG synthesis (Figure 5.2; Chapter 17) in vertebrates.'
 'Branching is a prime characteristic of many glycans found on mammalian cell surfaces. Glycans representing two major types of eukaryotic protein glycosylation are shown in Figure 3.1. An N-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the side-chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue that is a part of a consensus peptide sequence NX(S/T). An O-glycan makes a glycosidic bond with the terminal oxygen of a serine or threonine residue. N-Glycans contain a core composed of three mannose residues and two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Manα1-6[Manα1-3]Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-N-Asn). The depicted glycan is a biantennary glycan with branches linked at the 3- and 6-positions of the first mannose residue in the glycan chain. However, more complex structures exist with three and four branches. Details of the synthesis and biological importance of these glycans are presented in Chapter 9. The depicted O-glycan contains a typical core structure (one of four common cores) that begins at the reducing end with an N-acetylgalactosamine α-linked to a serine or threonine (GlcNAcβ1-6[Galβ1-3]GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). It begins as a biantennary structure but can be further extended toward the nonreducing end to form more complex structures. The synthesis and biological importance of O-glycans are described in Chapters 10 (O-GalNAc) and 19 (O-GlcNAc). Examples of branched structures in N- and O-linked glycans.  Both glycans depicted are terminated with a sialic acid (often Neu5Ac in humans) at their nonreducing end. Sialylation is characteristic of mammalian glycans and important for immune response. In protein–glycan interactions, not only are particular residues recognized, but often their position in a branching structure is recognized as well. An interesting example is the interaction of the enzyme that adds the 2-6-linked sialic acids to the termini of N-glycans. It has a high preference for adding to the 1-3-linked branch (by more than an order of magnitude) despite the fact that the residues on both branches are identical back to the mannose at the branch point (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα-). This may give some indication of the extent to which branching plays a role in recognition processes. Unique among mammals are free oligosaccharides present in milk. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are highly abundant in breast milk. Unlike most glycans that are conjugated to either proteins or lipids, HMOs are unconjugated in their native states. Thus, they contain a reactive aldehyde on the reducing end. HMOs decrease during lactation but are often even more abundant than proteins. Although the precise details of their synthesis are still not well known, HMO structures are more similar to glycans on glycolipids and O-glycans on proteins. The structures are based on a lactose core (Galβ1-4Glc) and extend either in branched or linear forms. Extensions are composed primarily of glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acids. As molecules, they are generally small, with the majority of the structures in the range of three to six monosaccharides; however, structures with more than 20 monosaccharides have been observed. HMO structures have been characterized by advanced glycomic analytical tools such as liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (see Chapter 50). Hundreds of structures have been observed, although one mother typically produces about 100 structures. There are two HMO phenotypes (from four genotypes) that determine the types of structures in the milk. Mothers who secrete their blood type or the Lewis b epitope are termed secretors. Secretors produce structures that contain α1-2-linked fucose.'
 'This glycosynthase proved highly flexible with respect to the acceptor phenol, allowing for the construction of a small library of flavonoid glycosides represented by phenolic disaccharide 12. Subsequent enzymatic removal of the nonreducing galactospyranoside provided flavonoid glucoside 13. Glycosynthase-mediated synthesis of flavonoid glycosides.  By combining the strengths of glycosyltransferases, glycosynthases, and chemical synthesis, the total synthesis of ganglioside LLG-3 from the neurogenic starfish was accomplished (Figure 54.7). N-Carboxybenzyl(Cbz)-protected CMP-sialic acid 17 was prepared by first performing a Neu5Ac aldolase-catalyzed aldol reaction of mannosamine derivative 14 and pyruvate 15. The resulting sialic acid derivative 16 was reacted with CTP under the agency of CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase to give donor sialoside 17. In a sialyltransferase-catalyzed reaction, compound 17 was condensed with α-fluorolactoside 10 to give trisaccharide 18, in which the amine was unmasked by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis to give trisaccharide, equipped with an anomeric fluoride for glycosynthesis and an amine for chemical amide bond formation. The sequence commenced by condensation of synthetic sialic acid derivative 20 with the free amine in 19 under amide bond-forming conditions, to give 21. Condensation of tetrasaccharidyl fluoride 21 with the double (E351S/D341Y) mutant of the bacterial endoglycosidase EGCase II gave lysolipid 23 in good yield. The free amine in 23 can be condensed with a fatty acid or alternatively with a fluorescent reporter group. A combined glycosyltransferase/glycosynthase/chemical synthesis of a lysosphingolipid.  Glycosynthases derived from endoglycosidases have been used for the construction of structurally well-defined N-glycoproteins (Figure 54.8). Hexosaminidases, both exo- and endo-types, hydrolyze N-acetylglucosamine-containing glycosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric configuration. In contrast to most other retaining glycosidases, some retaining hexosaminidases do not employ an enzyme active site nucleophile in the nucleophilic displacement of the aglycon, but rather utilize the N-acetyl group in the substrate for this purpose (Figure 54.8, insert). As a result, an intermediate oxazolinium ion intermediate is produced that after nucleophilic attack of water yields the hemiacetal with retention of configuration. Endo-hexosaminidases can be employed in transglycosylation reactions and, in mutant form, as glycosynthases. Glycosynthase mediated synthesis of homogeneous peptide N-glycans.  A demonstration of an endo-hexosaminidase-derived glycosynthase in action is given by the synthesis of Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptide 28 from a glycoprotein from HIV-1. The sequence of steps commences with homogeneous Man9GlcNAc2Asn 24 that can be prepared by exhaustive proteolytic digestion of soybean glycoproteins by pronase.

Does glycan synthesis occur in the mitochondria or the nucleus?,"[""The function of this and the glycogenin-like proteins deserve further investigation for their potential to mediate other cytoplasmic glycosylation events. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are independently replicating organelles that reside in the cytoplasmic compartment. Because of their evolutionary origin from bacteria, which are now known to have substantial glycosylation capacity, these organelles can be expected to possess glycosylation machinery. Indeed, there is evidence for peptidoglycan-like networks between the inner and outer membranes of chloroplasts of certain algae. In other algae, glycosyltransferase MDR1 (mitochondrion dividing-ring 1), an integral membrane protein with a CAZy GT8 glycosyltransferase domain, assembles the mitochondrial dividing ring using α-linked polyglucose nanofilaments that have been visualized between the two membranes. A similar process occurs in chloroplasts, and the conservation of these genes suggests that this might be a heretofore unrecognized example of organelle glycosylation for many eukaryotes. More recent cell biological studies emphasize intracellular connections between mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) elements of the secretory pathway. This might explain a pioneering observation that two nuclear-encoded mitochondrial glycoproteins appear to be conventionally N-glycosylated in the rER based on pulse-chase labeling studies and susceptibility to N-glycanase (Figure 18.1J). Indeed, lectin-binding studies suggest that mitochondria contain complex glycoconjugates. In Ewing's sarcomas, the plasma membrane protein MRP-1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1) is glycosylated and localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane and could play a role in drug resistance. Several plant chloroplast proteins, including carbonic anhydrase-1, α-amylase, and pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase in “higher” plants and Glx, Syn, MutS in diatoms, might be transported from the rER as N-glycosylated proteins (Table 18.1). The presence of N-glycans highlights their potential biosynthetic origin in the conventional secretory pathway, and how these glycoproteins transit to these organelles warrants further investigation. As noted above, mammalian mitochondria import OGT that O-GlcNAcylates some of their interior proteins. In addition, mono- and digalactolipids (MGDG: 1,2-diacyl-3-O-[β-D-Gal]-sn-glycerol and DGDG: 1,2-diacyl-3-O-[α-D-Gal-(1,6)-O-β-D-Gal]-sn-glycerol) are prominent lipids in chloroplast thylakoid membranes, and MGDG is essential for photosystem function (Chapter 24). Their synthesis is controlled by UDP-Gal-dependent galactosyltransferases residing in the inner and outer layer membranes of the chloroplast (Figure 18.1K). Under conditions of phosphate deprivation, the synthesis of these glycolipids is dramatically increased, becoming up to 70 mol% of glycerolipids. The glycolipids replace conventional phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine in a variety of other cellular membranes including vacuoles, mitochondria, and the plasma membrane (Table 18.1). DGDG almost exclusively resides in the cytoplasmic leaflet of these membranes and oriented toward the cytoplasm, which is opposite of the conventional orientation of glycolipids as known from animal and yeast cells. Variants containing sulfoquinovose and GlcUA, which conserve the negative charge, are also produced. Little is known about the trafficking of these glycolipids. Given the functional importance of DGDG for cells based on genetic studies, it will be interesting to understand how the asymmetric distribution contributes to cytoplasmic functionality of the cellular membranes. The above examples describe well-documented examples from both prokaryotes and eukaryote of bona fide glycoproteins that function in the nucleus or cytoplasm and are glycosylated by residential nucleocytoplasmic glucosyltransferases (GTs). This section addresses other potential sources of nucleocytoplasmic glycoproteins.""
 'It is possible that this is a type of diversity generator, intended for diversifying endogenous recognition functions and/or for evading microbes and parasites, each of which can bind with high specificity only to certain glycan structures (Chapters 37 and 42). Most well-characterized pathways for the biosynthesis of major classes of eukaryotic glycans are within ER and Golgi compartments (Chapter 4). Newly synthesized proteins originating in the ER are either cotranslationally or posttranslationally modified with glycans at various stages in their itinerary toward their final destinations. N-glycans are partially assembled on lipid donors on the cytoplasmic face of the ER and then flipped across the membrane where the oligosaccharide assembly is completed and transfer to the nascent protein occurs. This oligosaccharide is then trimmed and extended by the addition of one monosaccharide at a time as the protein passes through the ER and the Golgi. These glycosylation reactions use activated forms of monosaccharides (nucleotide sugars; Chapter 5) as donors for reactions that are catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (for details about their biochemistry, molecular genetics, and cell biology, see Chapters 4, 6, and 8). The nucleotide sugar donors are synthesized within the cytosolic or nuclear compartment from monosaccharide precursors of endogenous or exogenous origin and then actively transported across a membrane bilayer into the lumen of the ER and Golgi compartments (Chapter 5). Notably, the portion of the glycoconjugate that faces the inside of these compartments will ultimately face the outside of the cell or the inside of a secretory granule or lysosome and will be topologically unexposed to the cytosol. The biosynthetic enzymes (glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, etc.) responsible for catalyzing these reactions are well studied (Chapter 6), and their location has helped to define various functional compartments of the ER–Golgi pathway. A classical model envisioned that these enzymes are physically lined up along this pathway in the precise sequence in which they actually work. This model appears to be oversimplified, as there is considerable overlap in the distribution of these enzymes, and the actual distribution of a given enzyme depends on the cell type. All topological considerations mentioned above are reversed with regard to nuclear and cytoplasmic glycosylation, because the active sites of the relevant glycosyltransferases face the cytosol, which is in direct communication with the interior of the nucleus. Until the mid-1980s, the accepted dogma was that glycoconjugates occurred exclusively on the outer surface of cells, on the internal (luminal) surface of intracellular organelles, and on secreted molecules. The cytosol and nucleus were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. However, it is now clear that certain distinct types of glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within the cytosol and nucleus (Chapter 18). Indeed, one of them, named O-GlcNAc (Chapter 19), may well be numerically the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cell types. The fact that this major form of glycosylation was missed by so many investigators for so long serves to emphasize the relatively unexplored state of the field of glycobiology. Like all components of living cells, glycans are constantly being turned over by degradation and the enzymes that catalyze this process cleave glycans either at the outer (nonreducing) terminus (exoglycosidases) or internally (endoglycosidases) (Chapters 4 and 44). Some terminal monosaccharide units such as sialic acids are sometimes removed and new units reattached during endosomal recycling, without degradation of the underlying chain. The final complete degradation of most eukaryotic glycans is generally performed by multiple glycosidases in the lysosome. Once degraded, their individual unit monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytosol for reuse (Figure 1.8). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, the O-GlcNAc monosaccharide modifications of the nucleus and cytoplasm appear more dynamic (Chapter 19).'
 'Like the classical basic peptide–mediated NLS pathway, the sugar-mediated nuclear transport requires energy and is blocked by the lectin WGA, which binds O-GlcNAc at nuclear pores. However, unlike the basic peptide system, the sugar-mediated pathway does not require cytosolic factors and is not blocked by sulfhydryl-reactive chemicals. Additional evidence shows that BSA-GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc is rapidly localized to purified nuclei in vitro by a pathway distinct from the classically defined NLS systems. Validation of these fascinating results awaits characterization of the components involved, and identification of natural counterparts to the neoglycoproteins. A final line of evidence for nucleocytoplasmic glycans is the colocalization of glycosidases. In addition to the lysosomal hexosaminidases Hex A and Hex B, mammals possess two neutral hexosaminidases Hex C and Hex D. Hex C is the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) that catalyzes the removal of O-βGlcNAc. Like OGA, HexD has a neutral pH optimum and is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm; however, HexD has a preference for galactosaminide substrates. Isoforms of the Neu4 sialidase have been localized at the outer member of the mitochondrion. As described above, processing of products of ERAD have been ascribed to resident cytoplasmic NGLY1 and ENGase, but if the translocated proteins are not degraded, ENGase provides a mechanism to generate mono-β-GlcNAcylation at Asn residues (Figure 18.1H), and the cytoplasmically localized α-mannosidase MAN2C1 might process high-mannose N-glycans to simplified core structures. Overall, there are many tantalizing clues for the existence and importance of glycoconjugates with simple or complex glycans within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in addition to the ubiquitous O-βGlcNAc (Chapter 19) and the analogous O-fucose outside of animals. Well-characterized examples involve novel linkages to the protein via tyrosine in animal and yeast glycogenin, via hydroxyproline in protist Skp1, and via arginine in bacteria (Table 18.1). The known glycosyltransferases that mediate these modifications are traditional cytoplasmically localized proteins that evolved from the same evolutionary lineages that generated the enzymes of the secretory pathway. At present, these modifications appear to be directed to specific protein targets. Cytoplasmic glycosylation is also a strategy for pathogens to control host-cell responses, and these mechanisms also frequently involve novel linkages and target single proteins. These examples clearly establish the importance of cytoplasmic and nuclear glycosylation in protein-specific regulation, which contrasts with the relatively broad distribution and heterogeneity of glycans on cell surface, extracellular matrix, and blood proteins. However, much remains to be explored to establish the generality of this concept. Significantly, there exists substantial indirect evidence for much more extensive complex cytoplasmic glycosylation in animal cells, and cell biologists continue to illustrate novel mechanisms of protein compartmentalization that could allow a protein that is glycosylated in one place to be transferred to another, as more commonly occurs in prokaryotes. Nevertheless, proof of the implied prevalence of familiar or unfamiliar glycans will require detailed structural evidence in conjunction with supporting biosynthetic, cell biological, and functional studies. Given that much of what is known about cytoplasmic glycosylation has only recently emerged, it is indeed likely that much remains to be discovered in this realm, and that these pathways are much more common in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes than is currently appreciated. This promises to be an exciting and important area of research in the future. The authors appreciate helpful comments from Priya Umapathi.'
 'Figure 4.1 superficially depicts some steps in the synthesis of the major glycan classes in the ER–Golgi pathway of animal cells. Initiation and maturation of the major types of eukaryotic glycoconjugates in relation to subcellular trafficking in the ER–Golgi–plasma membrane pathway. This illustration outlines the different mechanisms and topology for initiation, (more...) In the ER–Golgi pathway, some glycan chains are made on the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes and flipped across to the other side, but most are added to the growing chain on the inside of the ER or the Golgi (Figure 4.1). Regardless, the portion of a molecule that faces the inside of the lumen of the ER or Golgi will ultimately face the outside of the cell or the inside of a secretory granule or lysosome. To date, there are no well-documented exceptions to this topological rule. Of course, these topological considerations are reversed for nuclear and cytoplasmic glycosylation (see below), because the active sites of the relevant glycosyltransferases for these reactions face the cytoplasm. Not surprisingly then, the types of glycans found on the two sides of the cell membrane so far appear to be distinct from each other. Some “leaderless secretory proteins” destined for the extracellular space never enter the ER lumen, but are instead transferred directly through the plasma membrane, by as yet poorly defined mechanisms, including cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and galectins. Interestingly, many of these proteins have glycan binding properties, which would presumably cause problems if they instead traversed the glycan rich ER–Golgi pathway. Regardless of location, most glycosylation reactions use activated forms of monosaccharides (often nucleotide sugars and in some cases lipid-phosphate-linked sugars, such as dolichol phosphate mannose) as donors for glycosyltransferases (see Chapter 5 for a listing of some enzymes, their donors and corresponding transporters, and details about their biochemistry). A variety of glycan modifications also occur in nature (Chapter 6). Of these, the most common are generated by sulfotransferases, acetyltransferases, and methyltransferases, which use activated forms of sulfate (3′-phosphoadenyl-5′-phosphosulfate; PAPS), acetate (acetyl-CoA), and methyl groups (S-adenosylmethionine; AdoMet), respectively. Almost all donors for glycosylation reactions and glycan modifications are synthesized within the cytosolic compartment, from precursors of endogenous origin. In eukaryotes, most of these donors are actively transported across a membrane bilayer by specific multipass transporter proteins, becoming available for reactions within the lumen of the ER–Golgi pathway. For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments. Indeed, one of them (O-linked GlcNAc; Chapter 19) may well be quantitatively the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cells. Both the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) responsible for synthesizing O-linked GlcNAc on nuclear and cytosolic proteins and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) that removes this monosaccharide are soluble proteins in these compartments. In addition, select cytosolic proteins can be modified with O-Glc, O-Fuc, or O-Man (Chapters 18 and 19). Because prokaryotic cells do not have an ER–Golgi pathway, they typically generate their cell-surface glycans at the interface of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm or in the periplasm (see below). Other glycoconjugates like hyaluronan in vertebrate cells, chitin in invertebrate cells, and cellulose in plant cells are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and simultaneously extruded across the membrane to the outside (Chapters 16, 24, and 26).'

The glycosylation of macromolecules is a highly compartmentalized process. Most of the enzyme donor precursors are synthesized in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm and transferred into the secretory pathway. There they are incorporated into the glycoproteins, glycolipids, or polysaccharides that are fated for delivery to the extracellular environment or organelles such as the lysosome. In some cases, the donor sugars are transferred to intermediate lipids presented at the cytoplasmic surface of secretory pathway membranes, and subsequently flipped into the secretory pathway for final incorporation into glycoconjugates. In other cases, polysaccharides are synthesized at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and simultaneously translocated to the cell surface. Thus the cytoplasm has a key role in the assembly of glycans that are, however, destined to function outside of the cytoplasm. In addition, entirely different glycosyltransferases exist in the cytoplasm or nucleus to glycosylate proteins and lipids that remain to function in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. There is also evidence for cytoplasmic and nuclear glycoconjugates that have acquired secretory pathway–type glycans by unexplained mechanisms. The origin and role of these nucleocytoplasmic glycoconjugates, mainly glycoproteins, are the focus of this chapter. We begin with examples of monoglycosylation, including both endogenous processes and those associated with parasitism, and note that one form, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-β-GlcNAc), is so prevalent that an entire chapter is devoted to it (Chapter 19). We then continue to complex glycans and glycosylation associated with mitochondria and chloroplasts and conclude with an assessment of nucleocytoplasmic carbohydrate binding proteins that may serve as glycan readers. Monoglycosylation, the addition of a single monosaccharide to the hydroxyl or amide moieties of amino acid side-chains, was first discovered in the form O-β-GlcNAc and is now known as a widespread modification of thousands of nuclear mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins throughout the animal and plant kingdoms and some protists, fungi, and bacteria (see Chapter 19). The addition of O-GlcNAc is linked to the side-chains of Ser or Thr and is mediated by a highly conserved lineage of O-GlcNAc transferases (OGT), a nonmembrane bound enzyme that resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus. A splicing variant is also found in animal mitochondria in which O-GlcNAcylation is found on respiratory enzymes. A highly related enzyme lineage, termed O-fucosyltransferase (OFT), mediates the addition of O-fucose (O-Fuc) to dozens of nucleocytoplasmic proteins in plants, numerous protists, and possibly bacteria. The OFT was first discovered genetically in plants as Spy, in which it controls transcriptional processes. In the protist pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, OFT modifies numerous proteins involved in transcription, mRNA biogenesis, nuclear transport, and cell signaling. Recently, Greb1, derived from another lineage of enzymes, was shown to O-β-GlcNAcylate estrogen receptor-α and potentially other nuclear proteins, which if verified is an interesting example of convergent evolution. Paralogs of these enzymes have not been described in the well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but biochemical data suggests that this yeast modifies intracellular proteins with mannose (Man) and even di- and tri-Man. Furthermore, several reports suggest that select intracellular proteins of mammalian cells are modified by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).']","Glycan synthesis primarily occurs in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, with subsequent incorporation into glycoproteins, glycolipids, or polysaccharides destined for delivery to the extracellular environment or organelles.

Which glycosidases are involved in glycosylating p53?,"[""The O-xylose-linked GAG chains (DS, CS, and HS) all share a common core tetrasaccharide: GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ-O-Ser. An endo-β-xylosidase has been detected in rabbit liver. How the linkage regions are degraded is not established. A very rare human disorder is multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD). All sulfatases are casualties of this defect because they all undergo a posttranslational conversion of an active site cysteine residue to a Cα-formylglycine (2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid) catalyzed by the Cα-formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is essential for activity. In essence, the SH group of cysteine is replaced by a double-bonded oxygen atom that probably acts as an acceptor for cleaved sulfate groups. Loss-of-function mutations in the FGE gene lead to inactive sulfatases. This deficit affects GAG degradation and any other sulfated glycan such as sulfatides. Glycosphingolipids (Chapter 11) are degraded from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases while they are still bound to the lipid moiety ceramide. Because glycosphingolipids share some of the same outer sugar sequences found in N- and O-glycans (Chapter 14), many of the same glycosidases are used for their degradation (Figure 44.4). However, specific hydrolases cleave the glucose–ceramide and galactose–ceramide bonds. Besides specific enzymes, noncatalytic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) help to present the lipid substrates to enzymes for cleavage. Ceramide glycanase (endoglycoceramidases) from leeches and earthworms release the entire glycan chain from the lipid, much like PNGase releases N-glycans from proteins. Degradation of glycosphingolipids. Required activator proteins are shown in parentheses and individual enzymes are as shown in previous figures in this chapter. (SAP) Saposin.  Some exoglycosidases are unique to glycolipid degradation, and their absence causes glycolipid storage diseases (Table 44.3). Glucocerebrosidase, also called β-glucoceramidase, is specific for the degradation of the GlcβCer bond. The loss of this enzyme causes Gaucher's disease. Heterozygous mutations in this enzyme have been shown to be among the most prevalent and robust genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease, highlighting a role for glycolipid degradation in the context of more common neurological disorders. A specialized β-galactosidase, β-galactoceramidase, hydrolyzes the bond between galactose and ceramide and can also cleave the terminal galactose from lactosylceramide. Loss of this enzyme produces Krabbe disease. Galactosylceramide is often found with a 3-sulfate ester (sulfatide) and a specific sulfatase (arylsulfatase A) is needed for its removal before β-galactosylceramidase action. Loss of this sulfatase causes metachromatic leukodystrophy and the accumulation of sulfatide. Glycolipids terminated with α-galactose residues (globo-series; Chapter 11) are degraded by a specific α-galactosidase, the loss of which causes Fabry disease. Sugars that lie too close to the lipid bilayer apparently give limited access to soluble lysosomal enzymes, and additional proteins called saposins are required to present the substrates to the enzymes. Saposins (SAPs), also called “liftases,” form complexes with multiple degradative enzymes for more efficient hydrolysis of short glycolipids close to the membrane.""

Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages and glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages. The diversity of natural glycans is reflected by the numerous glycosyltransferases and glycosidases encountered in nature, each exhibiting a defined substrate specificity. Natural glycans are often encountered in heterogeneous form and often produced in minute amounts making their isolation and characterization from natural sources often cumbersome. Therefore, glycobiology relies heavily on synthetic glycans, and synthetic methodology to produce glycans has witnessed tremendous progress (see Chapter 53). Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases offer advantages in the construction of glycans as these biocatalysts are very powerful under controlled conditions. This chapter summarizes recent developments in the use of (mutant) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of tailored glycans, including combinations of both enzyme classes and in conjunction with chemically synthesized intermediates are presented. The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide. Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center. The mechanisms employed by most Leloir glycosyltransferases are now resolved. Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide. (GCS) Glucosylceramide synthase, (UDP) uridine diphosphate glucose, (GBA) acid glucosylceramidase.  Glucosylceramide is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal exo-glucosidase, acid glucosylceramidase (GBA). Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water.'

This chapter explores degradation and turnover of glycans in lysosomes, especially with respect to human genetic disorders, with representative glycans, illustrating features unique to different pathways. Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans removed from misfolded, newly synthesized glycoproteins is covered in Chapters 39 and 45. Most glycans are degraded in lysosomes by highly ordered pathways using endo- and exoglycosidases, sometimes aided by noncatalytic proteins. Insights that unraveled these complex pathways emerged from studies of rare human genetic disorders called lysosomal storage diseases. In each disease, undigested molecules accumulate in lysosomes. Clever experiments combining enzymology with glycan structural analyses revealed the steps of the pathways and also unlocked the mechanisms of lysosomal enzyme targeting (Chapter 33). Lysosomes contain approximately 50 to 60 soluble hydrolases that degrade various macromolecules. Most of the glycan-degrading enzymes (endo- and exoglycosidases and sulfatases) have pH optima between 4 and 5.5, but a few have higher pH optima, nearing neutral. Exoglycosidases cleave the glycosidic linkage of terminal sugars from the nonreducing end of glycans (the outermost left end of glycans for figures in this book, e.g., Figure 44.1). Exoglycosidases recognize only one monosaccharide (rarely two) in a specific anomeric linkage and are much less particular about the structure of the molecule beyond that glycosidic linkage. This lack of specificity allows these enzymes to act on a broad range of substrates. However, exoglycosidases do not usually work unless all of the hydroxyl groups of the terminal sugar are unmodified. Acetate, sulfate, or phosphate groups usually have to be removed before action of the glycosidases. Esterases cleave acetyl groups and specific sulfatases remove the sulfate groups on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N- or O-linked glycans. Endoglycosidases cleave internal glycosidic linkages of larger chains. These enzymes are often more tolerant of modifications of the glycan; in some cases, they require a modified sugar for optimal cleavage. Degradation of complex-type N-glycans. The lysosomal degradation pathway of glycoproteins carrying complex-type glycans proceeds simultaneously on both the protein and glycan moieties. The N-glycans are sequentially degraded by the indicated exoglycosidases (more...) Even though the lysosomal glycosidases perform similar reactions, their amino acid sequences are only ∼15%–20% identical to each other. Thus, there are no highly conserved glycosidase catalytic domains. Lysosomal enzymes are all N-glycosylated, and most are targeted to the lysosome by the mannose 6-phosphate pathway (Chapter 33), share aspects of the recognition marker for assembly of mannose 6-phosphate on N-linked glycans, and have affinity for mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The concentration of enzymes within the lysosome is difficult to determine. Proteinases such as cathepsins are estimated to be ∼1 mm; glycosidases are probably present at much lower concentrations. About 50 known inherited diseases impair lysosomal degradation of macromolecules. Although each one is rare, together their occurrence is about one in every 5000 to 10,000 births. Loss of a single lysosomal hydrolase leads to the accumulation of its substrate as undegraded fragments in tissues and the appearance of related fragments in urine. Many of the human disorders have animal models.'
 'Lysosomal sialidase (neuraminidase), β-galactosidase, and a serine carboxypeptidase called protective protein/cathepsin A form a complex in the lysosome that is required for efficient degradation of sialylated glycoconjugates. Cathepsin A protects β-galactosidase from rapid degradation and also activates the sialidase precursor, but the protection does not depend on the catalytic activity of cathepsin A. Mutations in this protective protein lead to galactosialidosis in which the simultaneous deficiencies in β-galactosidase and sialidase are secondary effects of defective cathepsin A. Glycans that have GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc, GlcAβ1-3Gal, or Galα1-3Gal on the outer branches must first have these residues removed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, β-glucuronidase, and α-galactosidase, respectively, before any further digestion of the underlying oligosaccharide chains. Oligomannosyl N-glycans that enter the lysosome are hydrolyzed by an α-mannosidase to yield Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAc, a common intermediate of hybrid and complex-type N-glycan. A second α1-6-specific mannosidase can cleave this linkage in humans and rats, but only on molecules that have a single core region N-acetylglucosamine (i.e., those generated by chitobiase cleavage). Finally, β-mannosidase completes the degradation. Oligomannosyl N-glycans derived from dolichol-linked precursors or misfolded glycoproteins are handled differently (Chapter 39). Degradation of typical αGalNAc-initiated O-glycans has not been systematically studied. Many of the outer structures of N-glycans are also found on O-glycans (Chapter 14); therefore, degradation of these glycans probably uses the same group of exoglycosidases as discussed above. An exception to this is the linkage region, GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr. Patients with Schindler disease lack the α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase specific for αGalNAc and will not cleave αGlcNAc. This same enzyme probably removes terminal αGalNAc from blood group A–containing glycans (GalNAcα1-3Gal) and some glycolipids such as the Forssmann antigen (GalNAcα1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcβCer). Patients lacking α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase accumulate GalNAc-containing glycopeptides in their urine, but curiously they also accumulate more complex, extended glycopeptides containing N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid. The structures are the same as those found on some native glycoconjugates. Their production could result from a general slowdown of oligosaccharide degradation or may arise by reassembly of glycans on accumulated GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr glycopeptides. GAGs, including heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), DS, KS, and hyaluronan, are degraded in a highly ordered fashion. The first three are O-xylose-linked to core proteins (Chapter 17), KS is N- or O-linked, and hyaluronan is a free glycan (Chapter 16). Some proteoglycans are internalized from the cell surface and the protein portion is degraded. The GAG chains are then partially cleaved by enzymes such as endo-β-glucuronidases or endohexosaminidases that clip at a few specific sites. Endoglycosidase cleavage creates multiple terminal residues that can be degraded by unique or overlapping sets of sulfatases and exoglycosidases. Structural analyses of partially degraded fragments in the lysosomes of cells from patients with MPS revealed both the degradation pathways and genetic defects responsible (Table 44.2).'
 'Diastereomers as well as alkylated and acylated analogs of the alkaloids have interesting and useful properties. Notably, the galactose-configured analog of deoxynojirimycin (Galafold; Figure 55.1) has been approved as a pharmacological chaperone of the lysosomal α-galactosidase for the treatment of the lysosomal storage disease known as Fabry disease (Chapter 44). Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme generally impair its ability to fold and traffic from the ER to lysosomes. Galafold can bind to the mutant α-galactosidase in the ER and help it fold and avoid degradation leading to its improved trafficking and activity within lysosomes. N-Butylation of deoxynojirimycin makes this glucosidase inhibitor an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis, which is discussed in more detail further below. In other cases, alkylation of the amino group or acylation of the hydroxyl groups can improve the potency of the compound, presumably by facilitating uptake across the plasma and Golgi membranes. Some of these compounds have shown positive effects for treating diabetes, cancer, HIV infection, and lysosomal storage diseases (see Chapter 57), but some also induce male sterility. A major challenge with all of these enzymes is their limited specificity; thus while convenient and widely used, some caution is needed when interpreting resulting observations. The importance of O-GlcNAc addition to many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) has stimulated interest in developing agents to inhibit its addition by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or its removal by O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]). These enzymes provide excellent examples of successful rational design and medicinal chemistry efforts directed to the development of glycoside hydrolase and glycosyltransferase inhibitors. Alloxan and streptozotocin affect O-GlcNAc addition, but these compounds lack specificity. The first potentially useful OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1; Figure 55.3) was obtained by screening chemical libraries for compounds that displaced a fluorescent derivative of the donor sugar, UDP-GlcNAc. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry led to quinoline-containing ester (OSMI-4), which is a high-quality OGT inhibitor that is effective in cells. The active compounds do not block other N-acetylglucosamine addition reactions—for example, one involved in formation of the polysaccharide backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan (Chapter 21). In addition, 5SGlcNAc is another inhibitor of OGT that acts as a metabolic precursor leading to formation of UDP-5SGlcNAc. Its peracetylated form (Ac-5SGlcNAc) crosses cell membranes and undergoes deacetylation by nonspecific esterases to generate cell-active inhibitors. Modification of the N-acetyl group to give S5GlcNHex eliminated the need to have O-acetylation and provided a compound that could be used in vivo, although, like other metabolic precursor inhibitors, their use requires care because of possible off-target effects on other enzymes (e.g., GlcNAc transferases [Chapter 9]). Inhibitors of O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (OGA) and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT).  Several O-GlcNAcase inhibitors are based on N-acetylglucosamine. The first described, PUGNAc (Figure 55.3) inhibits O-GlcNAcase at nanomolar concentrations, but also inhibits lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (HexA and HexB; Chapter 44). 1,2-Dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NButGT) and the more potent aminothiazoline Thiamet-G are more specific and potent in cells than PUGNAc (Figure 55.3). A rationally designed glucoimidazole, GlcNAcstatin, also potently inhibits O-GlcNAcase with good selectivity over HexA and HexB.']",Endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases are involved in glycosylating p53.,Glycosidases remove carbohydrates from residues and do not perform glycosylation,0.0,0.9282901635303888,0.4795464506807994,0.007518796992481203,0.5833333333041666,1.0
Describe computational methods for predicting glycan structure based on a DNA sequence,"[""Because of their inherent flexibility, oligosaccharides typically exist in solution or on proteins, as an ensemble of conformations, making it a challenge to describe their 3D structure (see Chapters 30 and 50 for a description of 3D structures). Computational chemistry is an essential tool in analyzing glycan experimental data, to make predictions that may be tested experimentally, and to unravel and explain chemical processes at the atomic level. Web-based tools are available to generate a theoretical model of a carbohydrate 3D structure. A useful resource is GLYCAM-Web that provides tools for modeling oligosaccharides and glycoproteins in addition to providing downloadable structure files that can be used for molecular modeling. SWEET-II is also a carbohydrate 3D builder that is available on the GLYCOSCIENCES.de website. The two major databases for storing experimentally determined 3D carbohydrate structures are the PDB and the Cambridge Structural Database. Crystal structures of oligosaccharides are also available at Glyco3D. A recent extension of the latter is GAG-DB, centered on the 3D description of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Most of the carbohydrates in the PDB are either connected covalently to a glycoprotein or form a complex with a lectin, enzyme, or antibody. Recently, the PDB has undergone a carbohydrate remediation, ensuring that carbohydrates are accurately annotated. Therefore PDB entries now contain glycan annotations, which are available in LINUCS, GLYCAM (IUPAC-like), and WURCS formats. Despite the known sequon (NXT/S, X is not Pro) for N-linked glycosylation, many potential sites are not glycosylated in vivo, and there are no clear motif(s) for predicting O-linked glycosylation. Understanding the “rules'' of attachment site specificity for the glycosylation of proteins is thus an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. Over the past 20 years, neural networks, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been implemented to predict N- or O-glycosylation and C-mannosylation. Although the original tools were hosted on the Danish CBS Prediction Servers, additional resources have emerged in the last few years. Glycoprotein informatic resources of GlyGen, GlyCosmos, and Glycomics@Expasy now provide information on the glycan structures as attached to proteins in a complementary manner. The coverage and content depend on both automated and manual efforts to mine or curate current literature that contains characterized glycan structures and their sites of attachment to proteins and on supporting data from experimental conditions and biological sources. This collaborative, international bioinformatic integration of complex molecular data from all types of glycoanalytical techniques and interactions is in constant development and is essential for the continued progress of glycobiological research. Systems biology involves the development, simulation, and analysis of biological systems (including whole-body and environmental systems) at the molecular and cellular levels. As research on glycan biosynthetic pathway simulation progresses, its integration with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics data represents the next step. This will result in a holistic understanding of biological processes (Figure 52.1), such that glycomics data can be viewed in the context of complementary data. Such integrated knowledge will result in better elucidation of the glycosylation process, reveal new interactions with GBPs, and enhance our understanding of related functional consequences. The current coordinated trend toward RDF-based data integration is already shaping future developments of glycoscience databases. It will help bridge the gap between glycomics and other -omics that have already adopted RDF ontologies but that are still very much DNA sequence–centered. Indeed, 50 years after the advent of sequencing technology, DNA sequences, along with their links to other data types (gene expression, protein structure, etc.), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates.""
 'The identification process was, until recently, largely driven by manual expert annotation of the resulting MS/MS spectra. However, many glycoinformatics initiatives are under continuing development to automate this glycopeptide identification process using various strategies to identify intact glycopeptides by using characteristic fragment ions. Several software tools are freely available to address the challenge of analyzing glycoproteomics data, such as pGlyco, GlycoPAT, MSFragger-Glyco, GlycReSoft, GP Finder, IQ-GPA, O-Pair, and GPQuest. Licensed Byonic and open-source Protein Prospector and MASCOT, initially designed for proteomics studies, allow semi-automated identification of N- and O-glycopeptides from high-resolution MS/MS data. The recent HUPO-HGI (Human Glycoproteomics Initiative) interlaboratory glycoproteomics analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of some of these programs, with a focus on highlighting best practices in the different approaches. Quantitation analysis can either be performed using the generic SkyLine platform or dedicated tools in the Happy-Tools collection. In comparison to MS, few software tools are available for supporting (ultra)high-performance liquid chromatography (U/HPLC) data analysis and storage. GlycoStore is a curated chromatographic and capillary electrophoretic composition database of labeled glycans (2-AB, RFMS, and 2-AA) of N-, O-, glycosphingolipid (GSL) glycans and free oligosaccharides. The database is built on publicly available experimental LC data sets from GlycoBase, which has now been commercialized. To assist analysis, GlycanAnalyzer is available for pattern-matching N-glycan LC peak shifts following exoglycosidase digestions, which can be used to assign structures to each peak. GlycoStore also provides access to CE migration data for a limited set of glycan structures. NMR data was obtained on carbohydrate structures in the 1980s and 1990s and is still the best analytical technique available to obtain complete structural information on purified oligosaccharides, but is less used now because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material from biological sources. The CASPER (Computer-Assisted Spectrum Evaluation of Regular Polysaccharides) program predicts 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of glycans. As such, it is used for determining the glycan structures based on experimental NMR data. Another area of software analysis of experimental data has been in mining glycan array data sets to identify glycan sequence motifs recognized by various GBPs, such as plant and animal lectins, viral and bacterial pathogen proteins, and antibodies. Several data analysis tools for glycan array experiments have recently emerged, including MotifFinder, GLYMMR, CCARL, Glycan Miner, Glycan Microarray Database (GlyMDB), and GLAD. Such data analysis determines the relative binding strength/specificity of a GBP to a glycan motif or determinant on the array. RINGS also has analytical tools for predicting glycan-binding patterns from glycan array data. A few databases collect information on glycan-binding proteins. The Lectin Frontier DataBase (LfDB) provides affinity data for a few hundred lectins. UniLectin, which includes the UniLectin3D collection of thousands of curated lectin 3D structures, suggests a classification based on protein folds and stores these predictions. These classes enable the definition of profiles that can be used to screen sequence databases and predict glycan-binding domains. SugarBind is a curated database of literature-derived knowledge of pathogen–glycan binding, and MatrixDB collects glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Because of their inherent flexibility, oligosaccharides typically exist in solution or on proteins, as an ensemble of conformations, making it a challenge to describe their 3D structure (see Chapters 30 and 50 for a description of 3D structures). Computational chemistry is an essential tool in analyzing glycan experimental data, to make predictions that may be tested experimentally, and to unravel and explain chemical processes at the atomic level.

York, and Nicolle H. Packer. Glycans are branched, biosynthetic metabolic products that are commonly encoded by multiple genes. Unique genes may be involved in the biosynthesis of specific glycan classes (glycoprotein, glycolipid, glycosaminoglycans etc.), and at the same time, many glycogenes participate in the biosynthesis of more than one glycan class. These intricacies relating to gene expression, enzyme specificity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi compartment–specific localization of enzymes, the branched nature of glycan structures, and species-specific variation in monosaccharide composition makes the analysis of glycosylation processes complicated. To aid this effort, a variety of analytical methods have been developed to identify and quantify the structure of glycans and their conjugates in biological samples. Glycoinformatics tools and software aim to use computers to integrate these experimental data, using our knowledge of glycan biosynthetic pathways as a backbone. Glycoinformatics databases ideally curate experimental data allowing glycan structures to be rigorously defined, archived, organized, searched, and annotated. When linked to other relational databases, glycoscience data may then be integrated with related genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic information. This chapter describes the current status of glycoinformatics databases and software development, with focus on efforts to bridge the gap between glycan structure and function. Informatics plays a critical role in virtually every aspect of modern biology. Our ability to compile the genomes of diverse organisms made it possible to predict the protein sequences. These sequences are widely used as the basis to predict protein function and to enable proteomic analyses. Proteomic studies in turn advance biological research by providing experimental evidence that supports the expression of specific proteins, in particular tissues or cell types (Figure 52.1). The informatics resources that support these endeavors are facilitated by the fact that genes and the translated polypeptides (i.e., proteins) are typically linear molecules whose sequences are readily specified as a series of characters. These representations are easy to digitize and store and many powerful informatics tools for comparing and classifying polypeptides have been developed. In contrast, the development of informatics tools for glycobiology is more difficult for several reasons. Notably, glycans are not directly encoded by genes. Rather, they are the metabolic products of multiple enzyme activities, both glycosyltransferases [GTs] and glycosidases (Chapter 6). These reactions are tightly controlled by the availability of the donor and acceptor substrates in the cellular compartment containing the GT as well as by modulation of enzyme activity and expression levels. In addition, the organization and function of the ER–Golgi biosynthetic pathway is sensitive to many factors such as the metabolic or developmental stage of the cell or its level of nutrients (Chapter 4), and this leads to structures that can be complex (Chapter 3). Furthermore, glycans are often highly branched and their structures cannot be described as a simple linear sequence (Chapter 3). The critical role of glycomics in systems biology. Glycan structures have no template from which to be predicted, are regulated by cellular metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and modify both proteins and lipids.

 ""The critical role of glycomics in systems biology. Glycan structures have no template from which to be predicted, are regulated by cellular metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and modify both proteins and lipids. Glycomics thus requires the tools (more...) Because of this biosynthetic and structural complexity, it is not currently possible to accurately predict the structures of the glycans that an organism can produce under different environments or how these glycans are conjugated with other molecules, armed only with knowledge of the genome or proteome. Rather, the identity of each glycan in a biological sample must be identified using analytical methods (Chapter 50 and Chapter 51) that are sufficiently sophisticated to detect and discern the glycan's diverse structural features. Thus, research aimed at understanding the biological roles and consequences of glycan structures depends on the availability of integrated glycoinformatics databases. A consortium of international scientists under the GlySpace Alliance have made considerable progress in this area in recent years to streamline the annotation of glycans and related expression patterns such that they can be linked across diverse databases. Thus, a clearer path from glycan structure to biosynthetic pathways is beginning to emerge from these efforts. Interpreting glycan structural information in the context of diverse types of biological and chemical information is a challenge. For example, most glycans in animals are covalently linked to proteins or lipids. The glycan moieties of a glycoprotein are linked to specific amino acids (usually asparagine, serine, or threonine) (Chapters 9 and 10). Which sites are glycosylated and which structures are present at a particular site often vary, depending on many factors, including the type, developmental stage, and disease state of the cell or tissue. Collection, storage, and retrieval of a description of each protein's glycosylation is time-, tissue-, organism-, interaction-, and disease-dependent and thus presents a major challenge to bioinformaticians working in the glycosciences (glycoinformaticians) as it requires integration of conceptually diverse information. Moreover, many different types of digital tools are necessary, ranging from basic visualization software to software that assists in the interpretation and structural annotation of glycoanalytical data (e.g., mass spectra), to algorithms that identify correlations between glycosylation and other biological phenomena (e.g., gene expression, cell differentiation, disease). A major challenge facing the glycoinformatician is the representation of the information that is processed and produced by these software tools in ways that are conceptually accessible to scientists who do not have an extensive background in glycobiology. Glycoinformatics enables the development of streamlined data reporting and sharing standards. For glycoproteins, the structures of both the glycan and the protein must be represented along with the relationship between these two entities (e.g., the identity of the glycosylation site and the fraction of the protein molecules that bear the glycan in each physiological state). To make this information relevant, the scientist often requires explicit information about the biological context (e.g., tissue and disease state) corresponding to the specified glycosylation or describing how the glycosylation changes when the tissue or cell is perturbed. The glycoscience community is building on the efforts of the Human Proteome Organization-Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to develop similar resources that describe the information that should be included when reporting experimental data, with digital data exchange formats to facilitate communication of structural and biological information and controlled vocabularies that allow the data that is exchanged to be unambiguously interpreted. For example, the Minimum Information Required for A Glycomics Experiment (MIRAGE) initiative is modeled after the well-established Minimum Information for A Proteomics Experiment (MIAPE) initiative of HUPO-PSI. These standards are required for the emergence of glycobiology as a mature discipline that is accessible to the scientific community as a whole. A major component of databases is the standardized depiction of the glycan structures. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) (see Online Appendix 1B) universal symbol nomenclature for the graphical representation of glycan structures has been developed to facilitate such standardization and is used throughout this book. Online Appendix 52A lists current databases and journal publishers that have thus far accepted or strongly recommend the use of this nomenclature.""
 'Its principal limitation is sensitivity, typically requiring several nanomoles of glycan for even the simplest structure determination. Other limitations for both structural and metabolic applications are the relatively high cost of spectrometers and the level of expertise required for acquiring and interpreting NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there are emerging experiments using methods, such as dynamic nuclear polarization and looped, projected spectroscopy (L-PROSY), that provide several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for applications that can monitor rapid in vivo conversions of metabolites such as glucose and fructose. Diffusion-based methods can also yield spectra of mixtures of components, separated by diffusion constants (effective molecular size). When small amounts of sample are available and the source of the sample is known, the acquisition of a 1D 1H NMR spectrum, combined with simple 2D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), can frequently identify a glycan. A 1D 1H NMR spectrum can be collected on ∼30 µg of a decasaccharide in ∼20 min on a state-of-the-art spectrometer (900 MHz with a cryoprobe). The anomeric 1H resonances are usually well-resolved in a relatively noncrowded region of the spectrum and show characteristic scalar couplings that are small for most α anomers and significantly larger for most β anomers. Thus, a first glance at the 1H -NMR spectrum gives a good estimate of how many residues there are (one anomeric 1H per residue except for Sia and KDOs) in a given oligosaccharide and how many of them belong to each anomeric type. NMR also provides a good estimate of how many residues are in a repeating unit of a polysaccharide. Connections from the anomeric (H1) resonances to the H2 and subsequently other resonances of a scalar coupled spin system can usually be seen in 2D TOCSY data, which show chemical shifts (resonance positions) for coupled 1Hs as crosspeaks on columns or rows emanating from an anomeric resonance (a ∼12-h acquisition for a 30-µg sample). The chemical shifts of two or more connected 1Hs are often sufficient to identify a residue. For example, the downfield (higher ppm) position and small couplings of three H2 resonances connected by crosspeaks to three α-anomeric resonances can identify these as belonging to core Man residues of an N-glycan. Historically, a collection of easily resolved resonances, often from 1D spectra, sensitive to both monosaccharide type and linkage type, were called reporter group resonances. These often prove sufficient to identify a glycan, particularly when options are restricted by knowledge of biosynthetic pathways in the system under study. Today, it is possible to greatly extend glycan identification by including 13C chemical shifts correlated with directly bonded 1Hs using 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (Figure. 50.3). 13C is magnetically active, but 13C spectroscopy is less sensitive than 1H spectroscopy. To improve sensitivity, 13C chemical shifts are indirectly detected through 1Hs. Even with the improved detection, 13C is only 1% naturally abundant, and unless the sample is isotopically enriched, approximately two orders of magnitude more material is required for collection of these data. Improvements in NMR hardware can reduce the quantities or time required and allow hybrid experiments, such as 2D HSQC-TOCSY, also illustrated in Figure 50.3. Furthermore, significant spectral overlap can be overcome with recent 2D NMR experiments optimized by using direct detection on 13C combined with optimized data processing. Web-based computational tools that rely on empirical rules or databases that correlate chemical shifts with structural features now exist, and these allow facile prediction of possible structures from 1D and 2D NMR data (e.g., CASPER).

Why do plants and animals express similar repetoires of glycans despite their vastly different physiology?,"['Last but not least, innate immune mechanisms are kept in check in vivo via recognition of self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs). Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses. Perhaps not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved this state of molecular mimicry by making use of “every possible trick in the book,” including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer. In some instances, the impact of the pathogen is aggravated by autoimmune reactions, resulting from host reactions to these self-like antigens. Pathogens and parasites also engage in glycogimmickry—to cite just a few examples, the gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis induces tolerogenic states of gut immunity using a pentasaccharide called polysaccharide A, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) binding to host dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbingcnonintegrin (DC-SIGN) induces expression of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10, and helminthic parasites have evolved many ways to modulate the immune response of their hosts toward prolonged tolerance, using specific immunomodulatory glycans. Secreted and soluble milk oligosaccharides (all extensions of the disaccharide lactose) of mammals provide an example of trans-generational glycan manipulation of microbial symbionts or pathogens in the infant by maternal glycans. These glycans have potent effects by favoring symbionts and blocking pathogenic microbes (bacteria and viruses) of the infant gut. Expression of certain glycans on different glycoconjugates in different tissues at different stages of development implies diverse roles for these glycan structures within the same organism. For example, Man-6-P-containing glycans were first found on lysosomal enzymes and are involved in lysosomal trafficking (Chapter 33). However, such glycans are now known to occur on some apparently unrelated proteins, for different functional roles. Likewise, the sialylated fucosylated lactosamines critical for selectin recognition (Chapter 34) are found in a variety of unrelated cell types in mammals, and the polySia chains that play an important part in embryonic nervous system neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) function (Chapter 15) are also found on a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) (CCR7) expressed in dendritic cells, where they appear to be important for targeting of these cells to the lymph nodes. Given that glycans are added posttranslationally, these observations should not be surprising. Once a new glycan or modification has been expressed in an organism, several distinct functions could evolve independently in different tissues and at different times in development. If any of these situations mediated a function valuable to survival and reproduction, the genetic mechanisms responsible for expression of the glycan and its expression pattern would remain conserved in evolution. A further example of dual roles is the recognition of fragments of structural glycans as danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the immune systems of multicellular organisms. Examples include cell wall fragments in plants and hyaluronan fragments in vertebrates. The core structures of major glycan classes tend to be conserved across many species; for example, the core structure of N-glycans is conserved across all eukaryotes and at least some Archaea (Chapter 9). However, there can be considerable diversity in outer-chain glycosylation, even among relatively similar species. Such interspecies variation in glycan structure indicates that some glycan sequences do not have fundamental and universal roles in all tissues and cell types in which they are expressed. Of course, such diversity could be involved in generating differences in morphology and function between species. Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20).'
 'The lower the temperature, the more polar the composition of brain gangliosides; poikilothermic (cold-blooded) animals tend to express many polysialylated gangliosides in the brain. Heparan and chondroitin sulfate are found in many animal taxa, including insects (Chapter 26) and in mollusks. The most widely distributed and evolutionarily ancient class appears to be chondroitin chains, which are not always sulfated (e.g., in C. elegans) (Chapter 25). The more highly sulfated and epimerized forms of heparin and dermatan sulfate tend to be found primarily in more recently evolved animal species of the deuterostome lineage. The same is true of hyaluronan, a secreted free glycosaminoglycan synthesized at the cell membrane and likely evolved from its precursor chitin to facilitate the movement of metazoan cells and shaping of organs during development and normal physiology. Echinoderms such as the sea cucumber make typical chondroitin chains, but some glucuronic acids have branches containing fucose sulfate. Simpler multicellular animals such as sponges can have unusual glycosaminoglycans that include uronic acids but do not have the typical repeat units of chondroitin and heparan sulfate. Plants do not have typical animal glycosaminoglycans. Instead, they have secreted acidic pectin polysaccharides not attached to protein cores (only hyaluronan is unattached among animal glycosaminoglycans), characterized by galacturonic acid and its methyl ester derivative (Chapter 24). Bacteria have mostly completely distinct polysaccharides (Chapter 21), although certain pathogenic strains can mimic mammalian glycosaminoglycan chains (see below). The O-β-GlcNAc modification common on cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) is widely expressed in “higher” animals and in plants, and its occurrence on histone tails implicates this modification in epigenetic regulation mechanisms. The connections between nutrient state, UDP-GlcNAc levels, and O-GlcNAcylation mean that gene regulation has an important metabolic dimension. Conserved homologs of the responsible O-GlcNAc transferase have been found in many eukaryotic taxa and in a wide range of bacteria. An independent clade of enzymes evidently originating in bacteria mediates O-fucosylation instead of O-GlcNAcylation in plants and numerous protists (Chapter 18). Most interestingly, in some animal pathogenic members of Pasteurellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, homologs of the O-GlcNAc transferase catalyze a cytoplasmic N-glycosylation within N-X-S/T sequons of adhesins. Molecular mimicry of eukaryotic N-glycoproteins might be the driving force for this convergent evolution of an N-glycosylation system. Surprisingly, O-GlcNAcylation is apparently absent in yeast. However, nucleocytoplasmic yeast proteins can carry O-mannose in the same conserved regions that are modified with O-GlcNAc in mammals, suggesting that a cytoplasmic O-mannosylation evolved in yeast by convergent evolution to function similarly to O-GlcNAcylation. The most abundant biopolymers in nature include secreted polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin, and glycosaminoglycans. These large, chemically stable molecules provide crucial structural support for capsules, cell walls, exoskeletons, and extracellular matrices of countless organisms. The repeated β1-4 glycosidic linkages of cellulose and chitin also represent chemically extremely resistant sequestrations of accumulated glycans, given the inability of most organisms to hydrolyze these robust linkages. Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution.'

This chapter provides an overview of glycosylation patterns across biological taxa and discusses glycan complexity and diversity from an evolutionary perspective. As much of the currently available information concerns vertebrates, this chapter emphasizes comparisons between vertebrate glycans and those of other taxa. Evolutionary processes that likely determine generation of glycan diversity are briefly considered, including intrinsic host glycan-binding protein functions and interactions of hosts with extrinsic pathogens or symbionts. The genetic code is shared by all known organisms, and core functions such as gene transcription and energy generation are conserved across taxa. Complex glycans are found in all organisms in nature, and some have argued that polysaccharides were the original macromolecules contributing to the origin of life itself. Regardless of their origins, they vary immensely in structure and expression (abundance and patterns of distribution in and on cells, secretions, and extracellular matrices) both within and between evolutionary lineages. Partly because of inherent difficulties in elucidating their structures, our knowledge about this diversity remains limited, and there are few comprehensive data sets. For many taxa, there is a lack of any information on glycan profiles. Sufficient data are available to indicate that even though all living cells require a glycocalyx (a dense and complex array of cell-surface glycans), there is no evidence for a universal “glycan code,” akin to the genetic code. Importantly, glycan structures are not directly encoded in the genome. They are synthesized and modified by a network of enzymes in a template-independent manner, and glycophenotypes represent the outcome of co-expressed gene networks and nutrients. Glycans expressed by most free-living Bacteria (Eubacteria) and Archaea have relatively little in common with those of eukaryotes. They contain a much larger number of monosaccharide types and include many glycans exclusive to such microbes. In contrast, most major glycan classes in animal cells seem to be represented in some related form among other eukaryotes, and sometimes in Archaea. Figure 20.1 shows a circular depiction of the phylogeny of cellular life on earth. The rich glycan diversity encountered in the best-studied vertebrate species suggests similar diversity in other groups of organisms, and existing information points to complicated patterns. On the one hand, glycan patterns can form “trends” and characterize entire phylogenetic lineages, wherein one encounters further biochemical variation with subsets unique to certain sublineages. Conversely, many glycans show discontinuous distribution across phyla and distantly related organisms can produce surprisingly similar glycans, using either shared, ancient pathways or convergently (independently) evolved mechanisms. Circular depiction of phylogeny of cellular forms of life on earth. The lines inside the circle represent all 2.3 million species that have been named. However, biologists have genomic sequences for only ∼5% of them; as more sequences become available, (more...) The broadest base of evolutionary information concerns asparagine–N-linked glycans, a “general” glycosylation system found in all domains of life (Chapter 9). In prokaryotes, protein N-glycosylation takes place in the periplasm at the plasma membrane, whereas in eukaryotes, covalent attachment of an oligosaccharide takes place intracellularly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, with the protein-bound glycan being further processed in the ER and Golgi.'
 'However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity. A few examples include Escherichia coli K1 and Meningococcus group B (polysialic acid), E. coli K5 (heparosan, heparan sulfate backbone), Group A Streptococcus (hyaluronan), Group B Streptococcus (sialylated N-acetyllactosamines), and Campylobacter jejuni (ganglioside-like glycans). Initially, it was thought that the responsible microbial genes arose via lateral gene transfer from eukaryotes. However, in all instances in which genetic information is available, evidence points toward convergent evolution rather than gene transfer. For example, genes synthesizing sialic acids in bacteria seem to have been derived from preexisting prokaryotic pathways for nonulosonic acids, an ancestral family of monosaccharides with a structural resemblance. In contrast, bacterial sialyltransferases bear little resemblance to those of eukaryotes, and the vast sequence differences between different bacterial sialyltransferases indicate that these have even been reinvented on several separate occasions. Of course, lateral gene transfer is common among Bacteria and Archaea, facilitating rapid phylogenetic dissemination of such enzymatic “inventions.” Why do closely related species differ with regard to the presence or absence of certain glycans? Does the same glycoprotein have the same type of glycosylation in distinct but related species? Relatively little data exist regarding these issues, but examples of both, extreme conservation and diversification are found. A reasonable explanation is that conservation of glycan structure reflects specific functional constraints for the glycans in question. In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral). Even in the absence of important endogenous functions, glycans can have key roles in mediating interactions with symbionts and pathogens. The evolution of diversity and microheterogeneity (across tissues and cell types) in glycosylation could well be of value to the organisms in providing additional obstacles to pathogens that use host glycans for attachment and entry. Free glycans (e.g., milk oligosaccharides) can also have important roles in attracting and feeding symbiont microbial communities needed for internal functions (e.g., immune maturation) and in accommodating or restricting these to particular areas of the host. There can even be significant variation in glycosylation among members of the same species, particularly in terminal glycan sequences. The classic example is the ABH(O) histo-blood group system (Chapter 14), a polymorphism found in all human populations, which has also persisted for tens of millions of years of primate evolution and has even been independently rederived in some instances. Despite its clinical importance for blood transfusion, this polymorphism appears to cause no major differences in the intrinsic biology of individuals of the species (Chapter 14) beyond conferring a variable susceptibility to viruses, such as noroviruses, that use ABO glycans as receptors. Like other blood groups, the ABO polymorphism is accompanied by production of natural antibodies against the variants absent from an individual. These antibodies may be protective by causing complement-mediated lysis of enveloped viruses generated within other individuals who express the target structure. Thus, an enveloped virus generated in a B blood group individual might be susceptible to complement-mediated lysis on contact with an A or O blood group individual who has circulating anti-B antibodies. The glycosyltransferase gene ABO responsible for synthesizing ABO antigens is one of the few loci in the human genome shown to be under balancing (frequency-dependent) selection. This latter mechanism may also provide an explanation for interspecies diversity via selection exerted by pathogens recognizing glycans as targets for attachment and entry into cells.'
 'Compared to other types of glycans, structural polysaccharides show relatively little variation in evolution, which may indicate a more stringent selection for chemical and mechanical properties required for their functions. Interestingly, some of these structures, such as glycosaminoglycans, can also play nonstructural roles in other biological contexts, including cell signaling, which adds additional selection forces driving their evolution. Viruses typically have minimalist genomes and use host-cell machinery for replication. Thus, glycosylation of enveloped viruses reflects that of the host. However, there are exceptions. Giant viruses such as the algae-targeting chlorella virus and members of the amoeba-targeting Mimiviridae family have genomes large enough that they can express their own glycosylation machineries. On a smaller scale, specific viruses express glycosyltransferases as virulence factors. For instance, a baculovirus-encoded glucosyltransferase glycosylates insect host ecdysteroid hormones to block molting, and bacteriophage-derived glucosyltransferases modify 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases in the phage DNA to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide. In this regard, it has been suggested that the high frequency of heterozygous states for human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 44) may reflect selection for genomes that limit glycosylation of invading viruses. Host lectins may also be “hijacked” by glycans on viral surface glycoproteins. For example, Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1; Chapter 15) is used by the heavily sialylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to gain entry into macrophages. Viral protein sequence can also influence host glycosylation (e.g., by structural constraints on access for glycosyltransferases or hydrolases), in a manner that favors viral antigenicity, such as the high-mannose N-glycans on HIV-1 envelope gp120 trimers. Despite the enormous potential for structural diversity, a rather limited subset of all possible monosaccharides and their possible linkages and modifications are found in eukaryotic cells. Why one encounters only such a limited subset of the possible glycan structures is a puzzling question. Could there be trade-offs between the variety of glycan structures and the additional resources, such as energy and biosynthetic pathways, that cells/organisms need in order to maintain that variety? Or maybe the variety of structures is limited by a combination of positive and negative selection due to both, its intrinsic functions and interactions with symbionts and pathogens? Regardless, this limited subset has allowed better elucidation of structures of eukaryotic glycans. In contrast, Bacteria and Archaea have had several billion additional years to respond to selective pressure from pathogens; in particular, phages. These organisms also have short generation times and can exchange genetic material across vast phylogenetic distances via plasmid-mediated horizontal gene flow. Glycosylation in Bacteria and Archaea is far more diverse, both in terms of the range of monosaccharides used or synthesized, and in the types of linkages and modifications (Chapters 21 and 22). In addition, prokaryotic cell–cell interactions both within and between species are often mediated by glycans. However, most work to date has focused on the glycans of pathogens, and we may have barely scratched the surface of prokaryotic glycan diversity. Despite great differences between pathways generating glycan structures of bacteria and those of vertebrates, occasional microbial surface structures are strikingly similar to those of mammalian cells. Interestingly, most such examples of “molecular mimicry” occur in pathogenic/symbiotic microorganisms, apparently adapting them for better survival in the host by avoiding, reducing, or manipulating host immunity.']","Plants and animals express similar repertoires of glycans despite their vastly different physiology due to the evolutionary conservation of certain glycan structures across different species. This conservation may be driven by functional constraints for specific glycans, as well as by interactions with symbionts and pathogens. Additionally, the limited subset of glycan structures found in eukaryotic cells may be influenced by trade-offs between maintaining glycan variety and the resources required for their biosynthesis and maintenance. Furthermore, the interactions between glycans and pathogens could also play a role in shaping the similarities in glycan repertoires between plants and animals.","Plants and animals express very different repetoires of glycans, owing primarily to the preference of each for alpha and beta glycosidic linkages in their general metabolism.",0.25,0.9955812672915302,0.786021318031539,0.015873015873015872,0.6388888888675925,0.0
