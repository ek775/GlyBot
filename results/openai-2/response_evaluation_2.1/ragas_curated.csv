 'In addition, simple, rapidly turning over, protein-bound glycans are abundant within the nucleus and cytoplasm, in which they can serve as regulatory switches. A more complete paradigm of molecular biology must therefore include glycans, often in covalent combination with other macromolecules (i.e., glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids).'
 'Given all these major advances in basic and applied research on glycans, there is no reason why this major class of biomolecules should continue to be the “dark matter of the biological universe.” However, since the 1980s an entire generation of scientists have been largely trained without much exposure to, or knowledge of, glycans. Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine.'
 'Nevertheless, proof of the implied prevalence of familiar or unfamiliar glycans will require detailed structural evidence in conjunction with supporting biosynthetic, cell biological, and functional studies. Given that much of what is known about cytoplasmic glycosylation has only recently emerged, it is indeed likely that much remains to be discovered in this realm, and that these pathways are much more common in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes than is currently appreciated.'
 'As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems. When that intellectual singularity is eventually achieved, further editions of this book may no longer be necessary.']","As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA.

The chemistry and metabolism of carbohydrates were prominent matters of interest in the first part of the 20th century. Although engendering much attention, they were primarily considered as a source of energy or as structural materials, apparently lacking other biological activities. Furthermore, during the molecular biology revolution of the 1970s, studies of glycans lagged far behind those of other major classes of molecules. This was in part because of their inherent structural complexity, the difficulty in determining their sequences, and the fact that their biosynthesis could not be directly predicted from a DNA template.",1.0,0.44999630021612474,0.6839243382729092,0.07692307692307693,0.99999999998,0.4

 'Thus, much of the possible diversity may yet exist in nature. Although several hundred distinct monosaccharides are known in nature, only a minority of these are commonly found in well-studied glycans. Examples of common monosaccharides in vertebrate cells are listed below, along with their standard abbreviations (for details regarding their structures, see Chapter 2, and embedded links from the symbols in Online Appendix 1B).'

The percentage of each form depends on the sugar structure. The cyclic form of a monosaccharide is characterized by a hemiacetal group formed by the reaction of one of the hydroxyl groups with the C-1 aldehyde or ketone. For reasons of chemical stability, five- and six-membered rings are most commonly formed from acyclic monosaccharides. Hexoses (six-carbon aldoses) and hexuloses (six-carbon ketoses) form six-membered rings via a C-1—O—C-5 ring closure; they form five-membered rings through a C-1—O—C-4 ring closure (Figure 2.5). A five-membered cyclic hemiacetal is labeled a “furanose” and a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called a “pyranose.” Pentoses can form both pyranose and furanose forms.

 'In contrast, IdoA2S assumes the 1C4 or the 2S0 conformation (Figure 38.1), which reorients the position of the sulfo substituents, thereby creating a different orientation of charged groups. In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding.'

 'IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind.

Yet, there are some challenges related to the flexibility of the HS chains and the ionic character of interactions that dominate their energetics; glycosidic angles in HS chains are variable, and IdoA rings sample several conformations, including a chair, 1C4, and a skew-boat conformer, 2S0.']","The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins.

 'Being on the outer surface of cellular and secreted macromolecules, many glycans are in a position to modulate or mediate a variety of events in cell–cell, cell–matrix, and cell–molecule interactions critical to the development and function of a complex multicellular organism. They can also mediate interactions between organisms (e.g., between host and a parasite, pathogen, or a symbiont).'
 'Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions.'
 'The evolution of diversity and microheterogeneity (across tissues and cell types) in glycosylation could well be of value to the organisms in providing additional obstacles to pathogens that use host glycans for attachment and entry. Free glycans (e.g., milk oligosaccharides) can also have important roles in attracting and feeding symbiont microbial communities needed for internal functions (e.g., immune maturation) and in accommodating or restricting these to particular areas of the host.']","Evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu.

Even matrices secreted by unicellular organisms, such as bacterial biofilms, contain glycans, highlighting the significance of glycans in mediating interactions within and between organisms.","Possible reasons include their relative hydrophilicity, flexibility, and mobility in aqueous environments and their extreme diversity, allowing facile short-term and long-term adaptations to changing environments and pathogen regimes. In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function.",1.0,0.6667210053099458,0.7811556572051017,0.15384615384615385,0.99999999998,0.6

 'In eukaryotes, nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm or nucleus, whereas most glycosylation occurs inside the ER or Golgi compartments (exceptions being hyaluronan [Chapter 16] and nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation [Chapters 18 and 19]).

Indeed, asking what these roles are is akin to asking the same question about proteins. Thus, all of the proposed theories regarding glycan function turn out to be partly correct, and exceptions to each can also be found.'
 'Further diversity arises because microbial pathogens also engage in “molecular mimicry,” evading immune reactions by decorating themselves with glycans typical of their hosts, and even in “glycan gimmickry,” modulating host immunity toward increased tolerance. Finally, most microbes are also themselves targets of pathogens that use microbial glycans for attachment and infection (e.g., bacteriophages that invade bacteria).

Assembly of the Rha-Arg linkage activates EF-P and is required for pathogenicity of Pseudomonas, a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen, and a number of other bacteria.

The functions of glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) can be investigated using genetic strategies in sea urchins, antisense morpholinos or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down gene expression have been the methods of choice, but these will likely be superseded by more precise gene editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) strategy or transcription activator–like effector (TALE) nucleases (TALENs).",1.0,0.6273178929360501,0.6273114021650728,0.2,0.9166666666361111,0.3333333333333333

Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases.

It is reasonable to suggest that a greater M6P content may improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement in these patients. This has been shown to be the case in mouse and dog model systems.

 'Although their specific glycan-binding activities make such plant lectins extremely useful scientific tools, their biological functions in plants remain mostly unknown. The first animal lectin discovered was the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) identified by Anatol Morell and Gilbert Ashwell in the late 1960s during investigations of the turnover of a serum glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin.'
 'A variation of this approach was used in early studies on the characterization of the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR), in which the ligand 125I-labeled asialoorosomucoid was incubated with a preparation of receptor. The sample was treated with sufficient ammonium sulfate to precipitate the complex but not the unbound ligand.'

CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved.'
 'This chapter discusses inherited human diseases that are caused by defects in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (congenital disorders of glycosylation, CDGs). Representative examples are described of genetic defects in the major glycan families and what lessons we can learn from them about glycobiology. Among genetic disorders of glycosylation, those caused by somatic mutations are described in Chapter 46. Disorders affecting the lysosomal degradation of glycans are described in Chapter 44.'
 'Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33) it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found. In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations.']","Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years.

Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms. The test was positive in these children, thereby, for the first time, indicating a generic defect in protein N-glycosylation. Lacking further details about glycan structures and the underlying genetic variants, Jaeken decided to call these cases “carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes” (CDGS). Several years later, many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases. To keep the acronym “CDG,” those involved also decided to call them “congenital disorders of glycosylation,” rather than inherited genetic defects in glycosylation.

 'Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here. Many urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, which adhere to bladder epithelial cells via a mannose-binding lectin, FimH, located on the F-pilus of the bacterium.'
 'Thus, small soluble glycans or glycan mimetics can be used to block the initial attachment of microbes and toxins to cell surfaces (or block their release), and thus prevent or suppress infection. Because many of these organisms naturally gain access through the airways or gut, the glycan-based drugs can be delivered directly without being distributed systemically. Milk oligosaccharides are natural antagonists of intestinal infection in infants (see above).'
 ""Variable expression of these glycans may explain an individual's susceptibility to infection. For example, some pathogenic strains of E. coli infect the urinary tract using a lectin that binds the P blood group antigens (Chapter 14), with P negative individuals being immune. The E. coli P fimbriae lectins are also involved in spreading bacterial infections from the kidney to the bloodstream.""
 'Adhesion can be part of the infection process. For example, a mannose-specific adhesin on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli that cause urinary infections binds to epithelial cells of the urinary tract.

Binding of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, to its ACE2 receptor on host epithelial cells first involves its initial binding to neighboring HS glycosaminoglycan chains, which induces a conformational change to enhance binding to ACE2.

 'There can also be changes in Sia modifications in tumor cells. Sia 9-O-acetylation can be increased (e.g., 9-O-acetylated GD3 [Figure 47.3] in melanoma cells) or decreased (e.g., on the O-glycans of colon carcinomas). Some tumor cells express small amounts of de-N-acetyl (deNAc) gangliosides (Figure 47.3).'
 'Other lineage-specific losses of Neu5Gc expression may have occurred in a similar fashion. This is part of a broader consideration of Sias as both a pathogen target and a physiological regulator, a combination that apparently contributed to rapid evolution of both Sia expression patterns and Sia-binding proteins, especially of the Siglecs (Chapter 35). Despite CMAH inactivation in humans, traces of Neu5Gc are found in normal human tissues. This,'
 'Further structural diversity in Sias is generated by enzymatic modification of Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn via reactions that occur in the lumen of the Golgi and related organelles, and on mature sialoglycoconjugates, as well as at the CMP-Sia level.

The resulting weak immune response (termed “xenosialitis”) can promote tumor growth by enhancing chronic inflammation and angiogenesis.

Because the primary dietary source of Neu5Gc is red meat, this may help explain the increased cancer risk associated with its consumption.

 'A glycosidic linkage involves the attachment of a monosaccharide to another residue, typically via the hydroxyl group of this anomeric center, generating α-linkages or β-linkages that are defined based on the relationship of the glycosidic oxygen to the anomeric carbon and ring (Chapter 2).'
 'A glycosidic linkage is generally formed through the activation of a glycosylating agent (glycosyl donor) to create an electrophilic species that reacts with the nucleophile, for example, a hydroxyl group present on the glycosyl acceptor. Other possible acceptors include serine/threonine in the case of glycopeptides or a sphingoid in the case of glycosphingolipids.']","This method allows for the identification of the positions of linkages within the glycan structure by analyzing the modified glycan through various analytical techniques, providing valuable insights into the glycan's composition and structure.","Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol). This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide.",1.0,0.7222032786675407,0.6480571746406593,0.08333333333333333,0.99999999998,0.3333333333333333

Automated procedures for glycan assembly were slower to evolve due to the complexity of oligosaccharide synthesis compared to oligopeptides and nucleotides, but automated synthesizers are now commercially available. AGA has become an important part of carbohydrate synthesis, enabling the rapid accessibility of polysaccharides and glycosaminoglycans in multimilligram quantities. The production of highly branched structures is expected to become routine in the future. However, for challenging targets containing rare monosaccharides and specific linkages, improved methods for solution phase synthesis will need to be developed.","Enzymes can be used together with chemical methods to prepare diverse glycans (Chapter 54). The structure of oligosaccharides render their synthesis more complicated than the synthesis of the other major classes of biomolecules: oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11). The choice of protecting groups and the order of protecting group installation are essential for a successful synthetic route.",1.0,0.750827182479509,0.8691757723296709,0.125,0.99999999998,0.25

Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies.",0.8333333333333334,0.289576736733197,0.6941418173406262,0.125,0.99999999998,0.1

The SIGLEC5 and SIGLEC14 genes are adjacent to each other on chromosome 19 and encode proteins containing four and three Ig-like domains, respectively.']","CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were identified through genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed for the in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.","Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans. The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins. However, it became clear that these four Sia-binding molecules were a distinct subgroup sharing both sequence homology and Ig-domain organization, and that they were not all involved in adhesion. The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.",1.0,0.952665872904285,0.6147993219595329,0.2,0.99999999998,0.125

The composition (monosaccharide units), degree of polymerization (DP), and branching of the oligosaccharins determine their biological activity in triggering plant defense.'
 'More recently, additional plant cell wall–derived oligosaccharins have been shown to trigger defense responses, including cellulose-derived oligomers (β-1,4-glucans), mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs: β-1,4/β-1,3 glucans), and oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucans, mannans, xylans, or callose, which trigger signaling cascades in Arabidopsis and other plant species,'
 'It is also noteworthy that some immune-active oligosaccharides can be released from polymers present in the walls of both the pathogen and the plant. For example, β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides are released from callose, which is produced by plants and is also a component of many fungal and oomycete cell walls.'
 'For example, oligogalacturonides that are biologically active typically require a DP of 10–14 for activity, whereas DPs of >7 and >4 are necessary for the oligochitosans and oligochitins, respectively (Figure 40.2). A single active hepta-glucoside from oomycete walls was isolated from a mixture of approximately 300 inactive structural isomers and found to trigger defense responses in soybean.'
 'In this case, the released active oligosaccharides appear to be fragments of rhamnogalacturonans, which are distinct from the oligogalacturonides involved in plant defense. These results suggest that plants are capable of using the substantial informational content of their wall glycans to release signals for diverse cellular pathways and responses.

 'In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral). Even in the absence of important endogenous functions, glycans can have key roles in mediating interactions with symbionts and pathogens.'
 'Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20). Given all of the above, it is challenging to predict which glycan structures are likely to mediate the more specific or crucial biological roles within an organism.'
 'Structural diversity of surface-exposed N-linked glycans between populations and species is common, likely driven by an evolutionary “arms race” caused by exploitation of host glycans by parasites and pathogens. The intracellular attachment of the oligosaccharide to proteins that are in the process of folding is the basis for the role of highly defined glycan structures in the modulation and the quality control of protein folding in the ER (Chapter 39).'
 'Regardless of the mechanisms maintaining these types of polymorphisms, such intra- and interspecies diversity might also provide for “herd immunity,” a phenomenon whereby one glycan variant–resistant individual can indirectly protect other susceptible individuals by restricting the spread of a pathogen through the population. Such proposed protective functions of glycan diversity are only apparent at the level of populations.

 'There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development.'
 'Not all lectin-mediated targeting leads to degradation. Glycan-binding subunits of secreted bacterial and plant toxins typically target them to glycolipids on cell surfaces and facilitate entry of the toxins into cells (Chapter 37). Many enzymes contain glycan-binding domains that bring another domain with enzyme activity into close proximity with its substrates. One notable group includes bacterial cellulases in which cellulose-binding modules position the enzymatic domain for optimal degradation of cellulose fibers.'
 'Binding of the lectins to the cell surface can lead to aggregation of specific glycan receptors, promoting a variety of biological responses such as mitogenesis and various signal transduction processes.

How do conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates?,"['Early studies suggested species specificity in the occurrence of specific Sia variants. With analytical improvements, it became evident that Sia variations are more widely expressed across species but occur at differing levels. Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage (Chapter 27), which comprises vertebrates and some “higher” invertebrates (such as echinoderms). Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates.'
 'Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates. This may change as molecular techniques improve. For example, insects were believed to be free of Sias until their discovery in cicada Malpighian tubules and Drosophila brains, and later identification of a single Drosophila gene (SiaT) with sequence similarities to mammalian STs.'
 'Sias became prominent in animals when the Deuterostome lineage emerged at the Cambrian Explosion ∼530 million years ago. Sequence homology suggests that ancient prokaryotic NulO biosynthetic pathways later became an evolutionary template that allowed some microbes to reinvent Sias of “higher” animals by convergent evolution. Many important commensals and pathogens use Sia mimicry to evade the vertebrate immune system by one or more of several established mechanisms.'
 'When SiaT is inactivated, flies suffer locomotor abnormalities and defects in neuromuscular junctions. Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila. Sias have also been reported in the nervous systems of behaviorally complex protostomes like octopus and squid.'
 'On the other hand, no Sias or ST genes were found in the well-studied round worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (Chapter 25). It appears that Sias (other than Kdn, which probably appeared earlier) were “invented” in a common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes and then became essential in deuterostomes, while being partially or completely discarded in some protostome lineages.']","Conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates in that Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage, which includes vertebrates and certain higher invertebrates like echinoderms.

Overexpression of enzymes can lead to disruption of normal glycosylation patterns and unpredictable glycosylation. Instability of the introduced glycosylation genes and the use of antibiotics for selection have also been problematic for the long-term use of such engineered cells for production of therapeutic glycoproteins.'
 'A strategy for enzymatic modification of glycans postproduction has been developed that involves desialylation of recombinant glycoproteins, followed by in vitro transfer of a modified (PEGylated) Neu5Ac (as its CMP analog) to exposed Gal/GalNAc residues by a sialyltransferase. The process is in use with approved drugs, although heterogeneous modifications occur when multiantennary N-glycans are targeted.'
 'Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation.']","Glycosylation plays a significant role in influencing the stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic proteins. It can alter the size, charge, and solubility of glycoproteins to prevent rapid clearance from circulation. Glycosylation can also impact the circulatory half-life of therapeutic proteins in the blood. Strategies used to optimize glycan profiles include manipulation of glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues and cell types, desialylation of recombinant glycoproteins followed by in vitro transfer of modified Neu5Ac to exposed residues, and glycoengineering to improve or develop new therapeutic modalities. Additionally, enzymatic modification of glycans postproduction has been developed to achieve specific glycan modifications.","Glycosylation can also enhance the stability of the protein therapeutic against proteolytic degradation, oxidation, precipitation, and denaturation. As glycosylation can shield hydrophobic regions on the glycoprotein’s surface, it can prevent protein aggregation, which can help decrease immunogenicity. Glycosylation can also hide immunogenetic protein epitopes on the glycoprotein’s surface. While glycosylation has many effects on glycoprotein drugs, it’s challenging to ensure that the final drug product has desired glycosylation patterns. The glycosylation patterns on a protein can be heterogeneous in terms of where the modification occurs and the modification itself.",1.0,0.7952823264253717,0.8180228769888335,0.15384615384615385,0.99999999998,0.4
Can you explain the concept of glycan microarrays and their application in studying glycan-protein interactions?,"['The use of glass slides, microarray printing technology, and surface patterning of engineered glycophages displaying unique carbohydrate epitopes allows the production of glycan microarrays with the potential to examine binding of all types of GBPs (lectins, antiglycan monoclonal or serum antibodies, and glycan-binding cytokines or chemokines) to several thousand unique glycans, simultaneously. Binding is assessed by fluorescent or spectrometric techniques.'
 'The use of microarrays in characterizing GBPs is a central component of functional glycomics (Chapter 51). Publicly available glycan microarray binding data repositories are increasingly used in the field. A variation of glycan microarrays is a bead-based Luminex-type assay. In this high-throughput approach glycans are covalently immobilized on Luminex beads of different fluorophore properties.'
 'Microarrays in which a variety of lectins and antibodies are printed on a slide can also give valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. This approach is especially sensitive in regard to defining whether biological samples differ in glycosylation. For example, such microarrays have been used to identify glycosylation differences in melanoma metastasis, leading to the identification of core fucose as a critical determinant of metastatic potential.'
 'Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates.'
 'In a glycan microarray, glycans are linked, usually covalently, to a solid surface through reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-esters or epoxide-containing supports on a glass slide. Glycans are prepared to contain reactive primary amines at their reducing termini, but other chemical coupling methods are available.']","Glycan microarrays are arrays where various glycans are immobilized on a solid surface, typically through covalent linkage. These arrays enable the simultaneous examination of interactions between glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) such as lectins, antibodies, and cytokines. By using techniques like fluorescent or spectrometric analysis, researchers can assess the binding of different types of GBPs to numerous unique glycans in a high-throughput manner. This approach provides valuable insights into glycan-protein interactions, allowing for the characterization of glycosylation patterns and the identification of specific glycan determinants associated with various biological processes, such as metastasis in cancer cells.

MS has inherent challenges because of the isomeric and sometimes isobaric nature of the constituent monosaccharide units that form multiple glycan isomers exhibiting the same molecular mass.'
 'Ion mobility has also been utilized to resolve glycan isomers entering the mass spectrometer. Data from two or more approaches can be used to give confidence in structural assignments and can be facilitated by software that allows automated data analysis (Chapter 52). MS fragmentation has become the gold standard for glycan structural characterization. The goal is to generate information-rich fragment spectra that will allow unequivocal assignment of a glycan structure.'
 'Web-based computational tools that rely on empirical rules or databases that correlate chemical shifts with structural features now exist, and these allow facile prediction of possible structures from 1D and 2D NMR data (e.g., CASPER).

Examples of various classes of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins  Interactions between GAGs and proteins can have profound physiological effects on processes such as hemostasis, lipid transport and absorption, cell growth and migration, and development.'
 'GAGs show biological function primarily through their interactions with the hundreds of GAG-binding proteins found on cellular surfaces and in extracellular spaces. The structural factors that affect the strength and specificity of binding are key to the elicitation of a proper biological response. HS, the most studied member of the GAG family, provides a good illustration of the wide range of physiological and pathophysiological functions affected.'
 'An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway.'
 'The accumulation of these GlcNAc-proteins may result in the formation of aggregates that are harmful to the cell or they may interfere with intracellular signaling processes. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are signaling glycans because they interact with receptor tyrosine kinases and/or their ligands and facilitate changes in cell behavior (Chapters 16, 17, and 38).']","The structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines involve interactions with GAG-binding proteins found on cellular surfaces and in extracellular spaces.

The binding of GAGs to growth factors and cytokines aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway, without substantial conformational changes in the ligands, ultimately influencing processes such as cell growth, migration, and development.","In general, the biological activity and binding affinity of GAGs is dictated by their sulfation pattern, disaccharide unit sequence and 3D conformation; however, GAGs are also capable of unspecific binding of other positively charged proteins due to the negative charge provided by their numerous sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. Many proteins also contain specific evolutionarily conserved GAG-binding domains that mediate specific protein-GAG interactions. These domains often contain basic amino acids with small polar side chains (i.e. lysine and arginine), allowing flexibility and minimal steric hindrance for interaction with GAGs.",0.5,0.9474933627437155,0.7451381853194707,0.2,0.99999999998,1.0

Frequently, glycosylation must be optimized to ensure prolonged circulatory half-life in the blood. Manipulation of glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues and cell types has also been a useful element of drug design.'
 'Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms.'
 'Glycosylation can alter the size, charge, and solubility of therapeutic glycoproteins to prevent rapid clearance from the circulation. In addition, glycoengineering has been used to improve or develop new therapeutic modalities (Chapter 57). Glycans can also serve as ligands for lectin receptors that target therapeutics to certain cells.'
 'Glycosylation can also modulate interactions of proteins with one another. Some growth factor receptors acquire their binding abilities in a glycosylation-dependent manner while in transit through the Golgi apparatus. This may limit unwanted early interactions of a newly synthesized receptor with a growth factor that is synthesized in the same cell. Glycosylation of a polypeptide can also mediate an on–off switching effect.'
 ""The role of both homo- and hetero-oligomerization in the localization of some Golgi enzymes has been established. In addition, substantial evidence supports the role of glycosyltransferase cytoplasmic tails in enzyme retrograde transport and Golgi localization (see below). The length and hydrophobicity of a membrane protein's TM region determine its ability to partition into membrane microdomains and are now appreciated to be involved in membrane protein trafficking and localization throughout the cell.""]","Glycosylation of membrane proteins can influence their proper folding, stability, and function.

Explain the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition,"['Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses.'
 'The external location of glycans on most glycoproteins can provide a general shield, protecting the underlying polypeptide from recognition by proteases (mucins), blocking antibody binding (viral glycoproteins), and even (as in the case of mucins) protecting entire tissue surfaces from microbial attachment.'
 'Glycan-binding sites of cell-surface receptors like Siglecs can be masked/“blocked” by cognate glycans on the same cell surface, making them unavailable for recognition of external ligands (Chapter 35). On the other hand, some glycans can act as “biological masks,” preventing recognition of underlying residues (e.g., sialic acids can mask recognition of underlying β-galactosides by galectins or other GBPs).'
 'Sias in capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides can have beneficial effects for microbes in their hosts, protecting them from complement activation and/or antibody recognition of underlying glycans, also sometimes engaging the Siglec family receptors (Chapter 35) to dampen innate immune cell reactivity.'
 'Some sugar residues, or their modifications, may mask underlying antigens or receptors. For example, O-acetyl groups on the Sia of the sialyl-Tn antigen prevent recognition by anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. Gut bacteria may actively remove this mask. Dense O-glycosylation of mucin domains provides almost complete protection from protease degradation. The O-linkage between GalNAc and Ser/Thr residues is labile under alkaline conditions.']","Glycan shielding plays a significant role in protecting pathogens from immune recognition by blocking the recognition of antigenic epitopes, restricting immune cell complement system activation, and mimicking host structures. This shielding can also prevent antibody binding, protect tissue surfaces from microbial attachment, mask glycan-binding sites on cell-surface receptors, and prevent the recognition of underlying residues by certain proteins. Overall, glycan shielding serves as a successful strategy for pathogens to evade host immune responses.","Glycan shielding is utilized by some enveloped viruses to evade immune system targeting by their host. These viruses typically adopt host gylcosylation during synthesis of the protein envelope, allowing antigens to be modified so that host antibodies are unable to recognize them, thereby preventing immune response to viral infection.
