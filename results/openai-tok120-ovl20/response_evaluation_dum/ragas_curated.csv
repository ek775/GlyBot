They are crucial components of cell membranes, where they play roles in cell recognition, signaling, and adhesion. GSLs are highly diverse in structure, with variations in the composition and linkage of their carbohydrate moieties giving rise to a wide array of GSL species with distinct functions. These molecules are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus through a series of enzymatic reactions involving glycosyltransferases and other key enzymes. Dysregulation of GSL metabolism has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and lysosomal storage disorders.","Other GSLs were later identified because they accumulate to pathological levels in tissues of patients with lysosomal storage diseases, genetic disorders in which glycan degrading enzymes are faulty or missing (Chapter 44). For example, a sialic acid–containing GSL (GM2) was first isolated from the brain of a victim of Tay–Sachs disease, in which it accumulates, and was named “ganglioside” based on its location in nerve clusters or “ganglia” in the brain. Likewise, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was first isolated from the spleen of a Gaucher disease patient, where it accumulates. As purification, separation, and analytical techniques improved, GSLs were found in all vertebrate tissues. Hundreds of unique GSL structures were found that vary in glycan structures alone, each of which are presented on several distinct ceramides.

The O-glycans of four archaeal species have been characterized to a limited extent (Figure 22.3).

Intra-endosomal membranes and limiting endosomal membrane have different lipid and protein compositions. Membrane segregation and lipid sorting prepare the internal membranes for lysosomal degradation. During maturation of the internal membranes, cholesterol is continually stripped away (to <1%) and a negatively charged lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) increases up to 45%. This molecule is highly resistant to phospholipases. BMP also stimulates sphingolipid degradation on the inner membranes of acidic compartments. Because BMP is not present in the lysosomal outer membrane, the unique lipid profile ensures that degradation by hydrolases and membrane-disrupting SAPs occurs without digesting the lysosomal outer membrane.

 'Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved.']","Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33), it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found.

However, with advances in technology and increased awareness of glycosylation disorders, the field of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) has expanded rapidly, leading to the identification of numerous genetic defects that impact glycan biosynthesis and protein glycosylation.","In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations.

 'Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here. Many urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, which adhere to bladder epithelial cells via a mannose-binding lectin, FimH, located on the F-pilus of the bacterium.'
 'Thus, small soluble glycans or glycan mimetics can be used to block the initial attachment of microbes and toxins to cell surfaces (or block their release), and thus prevent or suppress infection. Because many of these organisms naturally gain access through the airways or gut, the glycan-based drugs can be delivered directly without being distributed systemically. Milk oligosaccharides are natural antagonists of intestinal infection in infants (see above).']","Additionally, optimized synthetic α-mannosides offer a promising approach for targeting specific pathogens involved in urinary tract infections (UTIs). By mimicking the natural α-mannosides found on host cell surfaces, these synthetic compounds can competitively inhibit pathogen binding, potentially preventing or treating UTIs. The variability in glycan expression among individuals may influence their susceptibility to infection, highlighting the importance of understanding and targeting these interactions for therapeutic interventions.","For example, some pathogenic strains of E. coli infect the urinary tract using a lectin that binds the P blood group antigens (Chapter 14), with P negative individuals being immune. The E. coli P fimbriae lectins are also involved in spreading bacterial infections from the kidney to the bloodstream. Binding of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, to its ACE2 receptor on host epithelial cells first involves its initial binding to neighboring HS glycosaminoglycan chains, which induces a conformational change to enhance binding to ACE2.

This technique is essential for elucidating the complex and diverse glycomes found in biological systems.","Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol). This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide.",0.5,0.7767509332675213,0.6895284864077158,0.3333333333333333,0.9999999999666667,0.16666666666666666

This comprehensive understanding of glycans is crucial for advancing research in various fields and developing new applications for these complex molecules.","Given all these major advances in basic and applied research on glycans, there is no reason why this major class of biomolecules should continue to be the “dark matter of the biological universe.” However, since the 1980s an entire generation of scientists have been largely trained without much exposure to, or knowledge of, glycans. Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies.",0.75,0.6567200712541844,0.7781082085718545,0.75,0.9999999999666667,0.1

 'CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia. It has two Ig domains and was the first of the CD33rSiglecs to be characterized as an inhibitory receptor, suppressing activation of FcγRI and recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Figure 35.5).'
 'The murine ortholog of CD33 exists as two spliced forms that differ in the cytoplasmic region, neither containing the typical ITIM found in most other CD33rSiglecs. Furthermore, mouse CD33 has a lysine residue in the transmembrane sequence and couples to the DAP12 transmembrane adaptor, as shown for mouse Siglec-H and human Siglecs-14, -15, and -16.']","CD33 Siglecs were identified through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental studies. The Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) family of proteins, including CD33, were initially identified based on their sequence homology to the sialic acid-binding domain of the sialoadhesin protein.

Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze protein sequences and identify conserved domains characteristic of Siglecs. Experimental studies, such as protein expression analysis, binding assays, and functional studies, were then conducted to confirm the sialic acid-binding activity and characterize the specific functions of CD33 and other Siglecs.

Overall, the identification of CD33 Siglecs involved a combination of computational analysis and experimental validation to elucidate their role as sialic acid-binding receptors in the immune system.","Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans. The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins. However, it became clear that these four Sia-binding molecules were a distinct subgroup sharing both sequence homology and Ig-domain organization, and that they were not all involved in adhesion. The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.",0.4,0.9999999999999993,0.7286427092946272,0.16666666666666666,0.9999999999666667,0.5

These enzymes play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates by adding sugar residues in a specific order and linkage to form diverse glycan structures.

The process of glycan elongation by glycosyltransferases involves several steps:

1. Recognition of acceptor substrate: Glycosyltransferases recognize specific acceptor molecules, such as glycoproteins or glycolipids, based on the structure of the acceptor substrate.

2. Binding of donor substrate: The enzyme binds to an activated sugar donor molecule, such as a nucleotide sugar (e.g., UDP-glucose, GDP-fucose), which serves as the source of the sugar residue to be transferred.

3. Transfer of sugar moiety: The glycosyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the sugar moiety from the donor substrate to the acceptor substrate, forming a glycosidic bond between the sugar residue and the acceptor molecule.

4. Release of product: After the sugar transfer reaction, the glycosyltransferase releases the elongated glycan structure, which can then serve as a substrate for further glycosylation reactions.

What factors contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species?,"['Does the same glycoprotein have the same type of glycosylation in distinct but related species? Relatively little data exist regarding these issues, but examples of both, extreme conservation and diversification are found. A reasonable explanation is that conservation of glycan structure reflects specific functional constraints for the glycans in question.'
 'In other instances, considerable evolutionary drift in the details of glycan structure might be tolerated, as long as the underlying protein is able to carry out its primary functions (changes with no consequences for survival or reproduction, i.e., those that are selectively neutral). Even in the absence of important endogenous functions, glycans can have key roles in mediating interactions with symbionts and pathogens.'
 'Such variations could also reflect the outcome of differing selection pressures by exposure to variant pathogen regimes. Furthermore, significant intraspecies polymorphism in glycan structure can exist without obvious functional value, although they may be involved in the interplay between parasites and host populations (Chapter 20). Given all of the above, it is challenging to predict which glycan structures are likely to mediate the more specific or crucial biological roles within an organism.']","There are several factors that contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species:

1. **Functional importance**: Glycans play crucial roles in various biological processes such as cell-cell recognition, immune response, and signaling. If a specific glycan structure is essential for a particular function, it is likely to be conserved across species to maintain that function.

2. **Selective pressure**: Evolutionary pressures, such as environmental changes or interactions with pathogens, can drive the conservation of certain glycan structures that provide a survival advantage. Species that possess glycan structures that are effective in these contexts are more likely to persist over time.

3. **Shared ancestry**: Related species often share a common evolutionary history, which can lead to the conservation of certain glycan structures and functions. These conserved glycans may have originated in a common ancestor and been retained through speciation events.

4. **Co-evolution with interacting partners**: Glycans often interact with other molecules, such as proteins or other glycans, in biological processes. Co-evolution between glycan structures and their interacting partners can lead to the conservation of specific glycan motifs to maintain these interactions.

5. **Genetic constraints**: The biosynthesis of glycans is a complex process involving multiple enzymes and genetic pathways. Genetic constraints may limit the variability of glycan structures within a species or related species, leading to the persistence of certain glycan motifs.

6. **Biological constraints**: Some glycan structures may be essential for the proper functioning of biological systems, such as maintaining cell integrity or mediating cell signaling. These constraints can drive the conservation of specific glycan structures across species.

By considering these factors, scientists can better understand the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species, providing insights into the roles of glycans in biological systems.","There is too little information available today to allow a comprehensive exposition of the evolution of even the major classes of glycans. However, based on available data, it is reasonable to suggest that selective pressures largely come from either intrinsic or extrinsic factors related to organism-specific functions of glycans and competitive host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Host glycans must evolve rapidly to compete with pathogens that have short generation times, high mutation rates, and horizontal gene transfer, yet glycans with a critical intrinsic role may incur deleterious effects if eliminated or mutated.",0.6923076923076923,0.6727439167995986,0.6771085357428436,0.25,0.9999999999666667,0.5
What is the significance of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains?,"['The β-trefoil fold presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding the 40-residue subdomain. The three subdomains, termed α, β, and γ, each consist of 12 β-strands and loops arranged around a central axis, giving the protein internal pseudorotation symmetry. β-trefoil fold is maintained by the characteristic Q-x-W motif in each subdomain of ricin B-chain and common R-type lectins.'

Discovery of new R-type lectins is ongoing. The ancestor of this superfamily is not yet clear, but it is found in members of all biological domains.']","The beta-trefoil fold is a common structural motif found in many carbohydrate-binding proteins, including R-type lectin domains. In R-type lectins, the beta-trefoil fold plays a crucial role in recognizing and binding specific carbohydrate ligands with high affinity and specificity.

The beta-trefoil fold consists of three similar beta-hairpin motifs arranged in a three-fold symmetric manner, forming a compact and stable structure. This structural arrangement creates a concave surface that serves as the carbohydrate-binding site in R-type lectins. The specific arrangement of amino acid residues within the beta-trefoil fold allows for interactions with the hydroxyl groups and other functional groups present on the carbohydrate ligands.

The presence of the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains enables them to selectively bind to specific carbohydrates, such as galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and fucose, among others. This binding specificity is essential for various biological processes, including cell-cell recognition, immune response modulation, and pathogen recognition.

Overall, the beta-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains is critical for their carbohydrate-binding function and contributes to their diverse roles in biological systems.

What is a common mechanism by which plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells?,"['One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins.'
 'Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture.'
 'There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development.']","Plant lectins can be toxic to animal cells through their ability to bind to specific carbohydrate structures on the surface of animal cells. This binding can interfere with cell-cell interactions, disrupt cell signaling pathways, and potentially lead to cell death. Additionally, some plant lectins have the ability to agglutinate cells, leading to clumping and potentially blocking blood vessels or causing other harmful effects.","Many plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas other lectins, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not toxic to animal cells in culture.

How do conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates?,"['Early studies suggested species specificity in the occurrence of specific Sia variants. With analytical improvements, it became evident that Sia variations are more widely expressed across species but occur at differing levels. Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage (Chapter 27), which comprises vertebrates and some “higher” invertebrates (such as echinoderms). Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates.'
 'Indeed, with exceptions, Sias are not generally reported in plants or invertebrates. This may change as molecular techniques improve. For example, insects were believed to be free of Sias until their discovery in cicada Malpighian tubules and Drosophila brains, and later identification of a single Drosophila gene (SiaT) with sequence similarities to mammalian STs.'
 'Sias became prominent in animals when the Deuterostome lineage emerged at the Cambrian Explosion ∼530 million years ago. Sequence homology suggests that ancient prokaryotic NulO biosynthetic pathways later became an evolutionary template that allowed some microbes to reinvent Sias of “higher” animals by convergent evolution. Many important commensals and pathogens use Sia mimicry to evade the vertebrate immune system by one or more of several established mechanisms.']","Conservation patterns for Sia (sialic acid) variants across vertebrates and higher invertebrates can provide insights into the evolutionary relationships and functional importance of these molecules. Sialic acids are a family of nine-carbon sugars that are typically found at the terminal positions of glycan chains on cell surfaces and secreted proteins. They play crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell-cell interactions, immune responses, and pathogen recognition.

In terms of conservation patterns, sialic acid variants can differ across different species due to evolutionary divergence and adaptation to specific environmental pressures. However, some common trends can be observed:

1. **Conservation within vertebrates**: Sialic acid biosynthetic pathways are generally well-conserved among vertebrates, with similar enzymes and regulatory mechanisms involved in their synthesis and modification. This conservation reflects the essential roles of sialic acids in vertebrate physiology and development.

2. **Diversity in sialic acid variants**: While the basic structure of sialic acids is conserved, there is considerable diversity in the specific variants found in different species. For example, humans predominantly express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), while other species may have additional variants or lack certain types of sialic acids due to genetic differences.

3. **Evolutionary adaptations**: Some species have evolved unique sialic acid variants or modifications that reflect their specific biological needs. For example, certain pathogens may exploit host sialic acid receptors for infection, leading to co-evolutionary changes in sialic acid structures to evade or resist pathogen binding.

4. **Conservation across higher invertebrates**: While sialic acids were traditionally thought to be exclusive to vertebrates, recent studies have identified sialic acid-like molecules in some higher invertebrates, such as mollusks and insects. These invertebrate sialic acid variants may have distinct structures and functions compared to vertebrate sialic acids, reflecting convergent evolution or shared ancestral pathways.

Overall, studying conservation patterns of sialic acid variants across different species can provide valuable insights into the evolution and functional diversity of these important glycans in biology. Bioinformatics tools and databases, such as GlyGen, can help researchers analyze and compare sialic acid sequences, structures, and biosynthetic pathways across diverse organisms to uncover evolutionary relationships and functional implications.","Ancestral sialyltransferase families in invertebrates have been identified through sequence-based analysis showing orthology with the last common vertebrate ancestor. Increased diversity within vertebrate lineages is inferred to have resulted from divergent evolution, with a variety of gain-of-function and loss-of-function events identified in sialyltransferases throughout their evolutionary history.",0.7857142857142857,0.9419572549726742,0.6474460817269341,0.2,0.9999999999666667,0.0
What's the relationship between Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes and plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis?,"['This information, together with improved methods to demonstrate enzymatic activity of recombinant plant GTs in vitro and wall structural analyses of the corresponding plant mutants is providing a framework for an increased understanding of how plant cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized. Most pectins and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and then secreted into the apoplast via vesicles.'
 'We also do not understand how the newly synthesized polymers are assembled into a functional cell wall in the apoplast. Plants produce glycoproteins and proteoglycans that contain oligo- or polysaccharides that are linked to hydroxyproline (Hyp) and serine (Ser). The protein component of these is present in relatively low abundance in the wall.'
 'Lignin is polymerized in the apoplast by nonenzymatic radical reactions. Despite advances in identifying and understanding the GTs involved in polysaccharide synthesis, we still do not know how many of the wall polymers are synthesized by Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes or if they are assembled by GTs localized in different regions of the Golgi apparatus.']","Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes play a crucial role in plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis. These complexes are responsible for the sequential assembly of various sugar monomers into complex polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, which are major components of the plant cell wall.

Within the Golgi apparatus, different enzymes work together in a coordinated manner to add specific sugar residues to growing polysaccharide chains. This process involves glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and other modifying enzymes that catalyze the addition, modification, and processing of sugar molecules.

The formation of multienzyme complexes in the Golgi apparatus allows for efficient and coordinated synthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides. These complexes facilitate the transfer of sugar residues from one enzyme to another, ensuring the proper assembly and structure of the polysaccharides.

Overall, Golgi-localized multienzyme complexes are essential for the biosynthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides, contributing to the structural integrity and function of plant cell walls.","The plant Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in cell wall biosynthesis, as it is the location for production of cell wall matrix polysaccharides, modification of protein glycosylation, and assembly/trafficking of cellulos synthase complexes.",0.0,0.9557387108006233,0.7908978913340332,0.2857142857142857,0.9999999999666667,1.0

Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans  The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation.']","Glycans play a crucial role in various biological processes, and alterations in glycan structures can lead to congenital disorders. Some ways in which glycans are implicated in congenital disorders include:

1. **Glycosylation defects**: Congenital disorders can arise from mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in glycan biosynthesis and processing. These mutations can lead to abnormal glycan structures, affecting the function of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Examples of such disorders include congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG).

2. **Cell surface interactions**: Glycans on cell surface proteins and lipids are involved in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and recognition processes. Abnormal glycan structures can disrupt these interactions, leading to developmental abnormalities and congenital disorders.

3. **Extracellular matrix**: Glycans are important components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to tissue structure and function. Changes in glycan composition can affect tissue development and organization, leading to congenital disorders affecting organs and tissues.

4. **Immune system**: Glycans play a role in immune responses, including cell recognition and signaling. Abnormal glycan structures can impact immune cell function and lead to immune-related congenital disorders.

5. **Neurodevelopment**: Glycans are involved in neural development and function, including neuronal migration, axon guidance, and synapse formation. Disruption of glycan-mediated processes can result in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Overall, understanding the role of glycans in normal development and disease processes is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying congenital disorders and developing potential therapeutic interventions.","Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs (congenital disorders of glycosylation) are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process. Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis.",0.9333333333333333,0.8445008260855662,0.7672386161059115,0.1111111111111111,0.9999999999666667,0.0

With the advent of monoclonal antibody technology, many “tumor-specific” antibodies directed against glycan epitopes were found.']","Glycans play a crucial role in cancer development and progression through various mechanisms. Some of the ways in which glycans are implicated in cancer include:

1. **Glycan alterations**: Changes in glycosylation patterns, such as abnormal glycan structures or altered glycosyltransferase expression, are commonly observed in cancer cells. These alterations can affect cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and immune recognition, contributing to cancer progression.

2. **Tumor cell adhesion and metastasis**: Glycans on cell surface proteins, such as selectins and integrins, mediate interactions between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix or other cells. Altered glycosylation can enhance tumor cell adhesion, invasion, and metastasis.

3. **Immune evasion**: Aberrant glycosylation on cancer cells can help them evade immune surveillance by modulating interactions with immune cells and masking tumor antigens. This can promote tumor growth and progression.

4. **Angiogenesis**: Glycans are involved in regulating angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation that is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. Altered glycosylation can influence the expression of angiogenic factors and promote tumor vascularization.

5. **Drug resistance**: Changes in glycosylation patterns can also contribute to drug resistance in cancer cells. Altered glycosylation may affect drug uptake, metabolism, or efflux mechanisms, leading to reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy agents.

The presence of glycans can influence the protein's folding, stability, solubility, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biological activity. 

1. **Stability**: Glycosylation can enhance the stability of therapeutic proteins by protecting them from proteolytic degradation and denaturation. The glycans can shield vulnerable regions of the protein, preventing aggregation and promoting proper folding.

2. **Function**: Glycans can also directly impact the biological activity of therapeutic proteins by modulating their interactions with receptors, enzymes, and other proteins. In some cases, specific glycan structures are required for proper protein function.

To optimize glycan profiles for therapeutic proteins, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Cell line engineering**: Selecting the appropriate expression system and cell line can influence the glycosylation patterns of the produced protein. For example, CHO cells are commonly used for therapeutic protein production due to their ability to produce human-like glycosylation patterns.

2. **Media optimization**: The composition of the cell culture media can affect glycan profiles. By adjusting nutrient levels, pH, and other factors, researchers can modulate glycosylation patterns.

3. **Enzymatic glycoengineering**: Enzymatic modification of glycans can be used to introduce specific glycan structures or remove unwanted glycans. Enzymes such as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases can be employed for this purpose.

4. **Glycan analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of glycan profiles using techniques such as mass spectrometry and HPLC can provide insights into the glycosylation patterns of therapeutic proteins. This information can guide optimization strategies.

These microarrays consist of a solid surface, such as a glass slide or a membrane, onto which a large number of different glycans are immobilized in a spatially defined manner.

Here's how glycan microarrays work and their applications in studying glycan-protein interactions:

1. **Preparation of Glycan Microarrays**: Glycans are printed or immobilized onto the solid surface in a high-throughput manner using various techniques such as spotting, printing, or chemical immobilization. The glycans are arranged in a grid or array format, allowing for multiple interactions to be studied simultaneously.

2. **Interrogation of Glycan-Protein Interactions**: Once the glycan microarray is prepared, it can be incubated with a protein of interest (e.g., lectins, antibodies, enzymes) to study their binding specificities. The protein binding to specific glycans on the microarray can be detected using various methods such as fluorescence, radioactivity, or mass spectrometry.

3. **Analysis of Binding Specificities**: By analyzing the binding patterns of proteins to different glycans on the microarray, researchers can determine the specificity and affinity of glycan-protein interactions.

2. GlycoWorkbench: This software tool allows users to manually interpret mass spectrometry data to assign glycan structures. It provides a graphical interface for visualizing and comparing experimental and theoretical glycan structures.

3. GlycoFragment: This tool predicts glycan structures by fragmenting them into smaller substructures based on mass spectrometry data. It then assembles these substructures to generate complete glycan structures.

4. GlycoPattern: This method uses a pattern recognition approach to match experimental mass spectrometry data with a database of known glycan structures. It identifies the best matching glycan structure based on the similarity of the experimental and theoretical mass spectra.

Limitations of these computational methods include:

1. Complexity of glycan structures: Glycan structures can be highly complex and heterogeneous, making it challenging to accurately predict them solely based on mass spectrometry data.

2. Database coverage: The accuracy of glycan structure prediction heavily relies on the completeness and accuracy of the glycan structure databases used by these tools. Limited database coverage can lead to incorrect predictions or failure to identify novel glycan structures.

3. Spectral noise and artifacts: Mass spectrometry data can contain noise and artifacts that may affect the accuracy of glycan structure prediction. Pre-processing and filtering of the data are crucial to minimize these effects.

4. Computational resources: Some of these computational methods require significant computational resources and expertise to run effectively, which may limit their accessibility to researchers without specialized training.

Overall, while computational methods can be valuable tools for predicting glycan structures from mass spectrometry data, researchers should be aware of their limitations and consider using complementary experimental techniques for validation.","Currently, structural determination of glycans is, at best, semi-manual and proceeds structure by structure.

"What are the structural determinants of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines, and how does this binding regulate cellular signaling pathways?","['For example, many heparin-binding growth factors (Chapters 17 and 38) bind glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of the extracellular matrix, adjacent to cells that need to be stimulated (e.g., in the basement membrane underlying epithelial and endothelial cells).'
 'Determining the physiological relevance of these interactions is a major area of research. Examples of various classes of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins  Interactions between GAGs and proteins can have profound physiological effects on processes such as hemostasis, lipid transport and absorption, cell growth and migration, and development.'
 'GAGs show biological function primarily through their interactions with the hundreds of GAG-binding proteins found on cellular surfaces and in extracellular spaces. The structural factors that affect the strength and specificity of binding are key to the elicitation of a proper biological response. HS, the most studied member of the GAG family, provides a good illustration of the wide range of physiological and pathophysiological functions affected.']","Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell signaling and growth factor/cytokine interactions. The structural determinants of GAGs that enable their specific binding to growth factors and cytokines include the sulfation pattern, chain length, and overall conformation of the GAG molecule.

1. **Sulfation pattern**: The sulfation pattern of GAGs, which involves the addition of sulfate groups to specific positions on the sugar residues, is a key determinant of their binding specificity to growth factors and cytokines. Different GAGs, such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), exhibit distinct sulfation patterns that allow them to interact with specific proteins. For example, the 2-O-sulfate and 6-O-sulfate groups on HS are important for binding to various growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

2. **Chain length**: The length of the GAG chain also influences its binding affinity and specificity for growth factors and cytokines. Longer GAG chains provide more binding sites for protein interactions, allowing for higher avidity and specificity in binding. Additionally, the chain length can affect the overall conformation of the GAG molecule, which is important for its interaction with target proteins.

3. **Conformation**: The conformation of GAGs, which is influenced by factors such as sulfation pattern and chain length, plays a critical role in their binding to growth factors and cytokines. GAGs can adopt different conformations, such as extended or folded structures, which can impact their ability to interact with specific proteins. The conformational flexibility of GAGs allows them to adapt to the binding sites of growth factors and cytokines, facilitating specific and high-affinity interactions.

The binding of GAGs to growth factors and cytokines regulates cellular signaling pathways by serving as co-receptors or co-factors that modulate the activity of these proteins. GAGs can enhance the binding of growth factors and cytokines to their cell surface receptors, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, GAGs can sequester growth factors and cytokines in the extracellular matrix, controlling their availability and bioactivity. By regulating the spatial and temporal distribution of growth factors and cytokines, GAGs play a crucial role in fine-tuning cellular signaling processes and modulating various physiological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.","In general, the biological activity and binding affinity of GAGs is dictated by their sulfation pattern, disaccharide unit sequence and 3D conformation; however, GAGs are also capable of unspecific binding of other positively charged proteins due to the negative charge provided by their numerous sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. Many proteins also contain specific evolutionarily conserved GAG-binding domains that mediate specific protein-GAG interactions. These domains often contain basic amino acids with small polar side chains (i.e. lysine and arginine), allowing flexibility and minimal steric hindrance for interaction with GAGs.",0.0,0.8982379673311713,0.7634854764034809,0.16666666666666666,0.9999999999666667,1.0
"How does glycosylation impact the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, such as folding, stability, and oligomerization, and what are the implications for drug targeting?","['Control of glycosylation is of major importance during the development of these drugs, because their glycan chains have marked effects on stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics in intact organisms. Frequently, glycosylation must be optimized to ensure prolonged circulatory half-life in the blood. Manipulation of glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues and cell types has also been a useful element of drug design.'
 'Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function. The classic work of George Palade indicated that most cell-surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells are cotranslationally translocated into the ER where they are folded, modified, and subjected to quality control mechanisms.'
 'Glycosylation can alter the size, charge, and solubility of therapeutic glycoproteins to prevent rapid clearance from the circulation. In addition, glycoengineering has been used to improve or develop new therapeutic modalities (Chapter 57). Glycans can also serve as ligands for lectin receptors that target therapeutics to certain cells.']","Glycosylation plays a crucial role in modulating the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, including their folding, stability, and oligomerization. Here are some ways in which glycosylation impacts these properties:

1. **Folding**: Glycosylation can influence the folding of membrane proteins by affecting their conformational stability and structural integrity. The addition of glycans can provide structural support and help in the correct folding of membrane proteins.

2. **Stability**: Glycosylation can enhance the stability of membrane proteins by shielding them from proteolytic degradation and providing a protective layer against denaturation. Glycans can also mediate protein-protein interactions that contribute to the overall stability of membrane protein complexes.

3. **Oligomerization**: Glycosylation can influence the oligomerization state of membrane proteins by mediating protein-protein interactions and modulating the assembly of protein complexes. Glycans can serve as recognition sites for other proteins, leading to the formation of oligomeric structures.

The implications of glycosylation on the biophysical properties of membrane proteins have significant implications for drug targeting:

1. **Targeting specificity**: The presence of specific glycan structures on membrane proteins can serve as targets for drug development. By targeting glycosylated regions, researchers can design drugs that specifically interact with these proteins, modulating their function or activity.

2. **Therapeutic efficacy**: Understanding the role of glycosylation in the biophysical properties of membrane proteins is crucial for designing effective therapeutics. Drugs that target glycosylated regions can have enhanced efficacy and specificity, leading to improved treatment outcomes.

3. **Drug resistance**: Changes in glycosylation patterns of membrane proteins can contribute to drug resistance in certain diseases. By targeting specific glycan structures, researchers can overcome drug resistance mechanisms and develop more effective treatment strategies.

In conclusion, glycosylation plays a critical role in modulating the biophysical properties of membrane proteins, which has important implications for drug targeting and therapeutic development. Understanding the impact of glycosylation on protein folding, stability, and oligomerization is essential for designing targeted therapies and improving treatment outcomes.","Glycosylation has been shown to ameliorate a multitude of pharmaceutically-relevant chemical and physical protein instabilities. Mechanistically, the different glycosylation parameters (e.g., number of glycans attached and glycan molecular size) studied so far can apparently impart different stabilization effects on the protein. While increasing the glycosylation degree apparently stabilizes the protein native state by increasing the internal non-covalent forces and rigidifying the protein structure, increasing the glycan molecular size appears to destabilize the protein unfolded state.",0.42105263157894735,0.8183667950763003,0.7104119803810558,0.375,0.9999999999666667,0.0
Explain the significance of glycan shielding against immune recognition,"['Pathogens that invade multicellular animals sometimes decorate themselves with glycan structures that are identical or nearly identical to those on host cell surfaces (Chapters 42 and 43). Such glycans block recognition of underlying antigenic epitopes, restrict immune cell complement system activation, and can also mimic SAMPs of hosts, all of which are successful strategies for evading host immune responses.'
 'The external location of glycans on most glycoproteins can provide a general shield, protecting the underlying polypeptide from recognition by proteases (mucins), blocking antibody binding (viral glycoproteins), and even (as in the case of mucins) protecting entire tissue surfaces from microbial attachment.'
 'Glycan-binding sites of cell-surface receptors like Siglecs can be masked/“blocked” by cognate glycans on the same cell surface, making them unavailable for recognition of external ligands (Chapter 35). On the other hand, some glycans can act as “biological masks,” preventing recognition of underlying residues (e.g., sialic acids can mask recognition of underlying β-galactosides by galectins or other GBPs).']","Glycan shielding refers to the phenomenon where glycans (sugar molecules) attached to proteins or lipids on the surface of cells or viruses act as a protective barrier, shielding them from immune recognition. This shielding is significant in evading immune surveillance and promoting immune evasion strategies in various biological contexts. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Masking Antigenic Sites**: Glycans can cover or mask antigenic sites on proteins or pathogens, preventing antibodies or immune cells from recognizing and binding to these sites. This helps pathogens evade immune detection and clearance.

2. **Modulating Immune Cell Interactions**: Glycans can interact with immune cells through specific glycan-binding proteins called lectins. By modulating these interactions, glycans can influence immune cell activation, migration, and function, potentially dampening immune responses.

3. **Promoting Tolerance**: Certain glycans have been shown to induce immune tolerance, leading to the suppression of immune responses against self-antigens or harmless foreign antigens. This tolerance can be beneficial in preventing autoimmune reactions.

4. **Enhancing Pathogen Survival**: Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria can use glycan shielding to evade immune surveillance and prolong their survival in the host. By masking their surface antigens with host-like glycans, pathogens can avoid detection and clearance by the immune system.

5. **Implications for Therapeutics**: Understanding glycan shielding mechanisms is crucial for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. By targeting conserved glycan structures or disrupting glycan-protein interactions, researchers can potentially enhance immune recognition of pathogens or cancer cells.

In summary, glycan shielding plays a crucial role in immune evasion strategies employed by pathogens and cells to avoid immune recognition. Understanding these mechanisms can provide insights into disease pathogenesis and guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","Glycan shielding is utilized by some enveloped viruses to evade immune system targeting by their host. These viruses typically adopt host gylcosylation during synthesis of the protein envelope, allowing antigens to be modified so that host antibodies are unable to recognize them, thereby preventing immune response to viral infection. As a result, some organisms develop antibodies that specifically target foreign glycoproteins in order to identify pathogens that may have adopted glycosylation patterns from another individual.",0.6111111111111112,0.836248431346257,0.8089789645827037,0.4,0.9999999999666667,0.3333333333333333
How is hemoglobin involved in glycan biosynthesis?,"['Notably, glycation of hemoglobin generates “Hemoglobin A1c,” the biomarker for measuring long-term glucose control in diabetics. Excess glucose increases UDP-GlcNAc through the glucosamine:fructose aminotransferase (GFAT) pathway, enhancing hyaluronan production (Chapter 16) and O-GlcNAcylation of multiple proteins that, in turn, alters their phosphorylation and functions (Chapter 19).'
 'Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, the biosynthesis of GAGs is not regulated by a well-defined template. Instead, each member of the GAG family is synthesized by a unique pathway (Chapter 17). The HS synthesis pathway, for example, involves multiple enzymes, including specific glycosyltransferases (or HS polymerase), an epimerase, and several sulfotransferases.'
 'In keeping with its evolutionary history, it appears HA synthesis is initiated by production of a chitin oligosaccharide (GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc)n. In typical cultured mammalian cells, division under conditions of hyperglycemia (two to four times normal glucose level) results in hyaluronan synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and transport vesicles.']","Hemoglobin itself is not directly involved in glycan biosynthesis. Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. 

Glycan biosynthesis, on the other hand, refers to the process by which glycans (complex sugar molecules) are synthesized and modified within cells. Glycans play important roles in various biological processes, including cell signaling, protein folding, and immune response.

While hemoglobin and glycan biosynthesis are not directly related, it is worth noting that glycosylation, the process of attaching glycans to proteins, can occur on hemoglobin and other proteins in the body. Glycosylation of hemoglobin can affect its stability, function, and interactions with other molecules. Studying the glycosylation patterns of hemoglobin and other proteins can provide insights into various physiological and pathological processes.",Hemoglobin is involved in oxygen transport and does not participate in glycan biosynthesis.,0.6,0.8950685604604987,0.7616586542064927,0.2857142857142857,0.9999999999,0.0
Does glycan synthesis occur in the mitochondria or the nucleus?,"['This might explain a pioneering observation that two nuclear-encoded mitochondrial glycoproteins appear to be conventionally N-glycosylated in the rER based on pulse-chase labeling studies and susceptibility to N-glycanase (Figure 18.1J).

 'In eukaryotes, nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm or nucleus, whereas most glycosylation occurs inside the ER or Golgi compartments (exceptions being hyaluronan [Chapter 16] and nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation [Chapters 18 and 19]). Therefore, newly synthesized nucleotide sugars are on the “wrong” side of the membrane for most glycosylation reactions and so must be transported into the ER and Golgi.'
 'For many years, the nucleus and cytosol (which are topologically semicontinuous via nuclear pores) were assumed to be devoid of glycosylation capacity. It is now established that distinct glycoconjugates are synthesized and reside within these compartments. Indeed, one of them (O-linked GlcNAc; Chapter 19) may well be quantitatively the most common type of glycoconjugate in many cells.']","Glycan synthesis primarily occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus within the cell, rather than in the mitochondria or the nucleus.

 'In some cases, it can even suggest potential ligands. Such predictions often motivate testing for glycan-binding activity, either by specifically examining binding to predicted ligands or by screening more generally using glycan arrays. Although structure-based predictions do not directly yield information about biological function, the organization of CRDs and their association with other domains often provide information about potential functions. This type of top–down analysis is limited to discovery of GBPs that contain domains resembling known CRDs.']","Computational methods for predicting glycan structure based on a DNA sequence typically involve a series of steps that leverage bioinformatics tools and databases. Here is an overview of the general approach:

1. **DNA Sequence Analysis**: The first step is to analyze the DNA sequence to identify potential glycosylation sites. This can be done using bioinformatics tools that predict glycosylation motifs or glycosylation sites based on the DNA sequence.

2. **Protein Translation**: Once potential glycosylation sites are identified, the DNA sequence is translated into a protein sequence. This is important because glycosylation typically occurs on proteins rather than directly on DNA.

3. **Protein Structure Prediction**: Predicting the 3D structure of the protein can provide valuable insights into potential glycan attachment sites and the spatial arrangement of glycans on the protein surface. Computational methods such as homology modeling or molecular dynamics simulations can be used for protein structure prediction.

4. **Glycan Attachment Site Prediction**: Bioinformatics tools can be used to predict potential glycan attachment sites on the protein based on known glycosylation motifs and experimental data. These tools take into account factors such as the presence of specific amino acid residues and the protein structure.

5. **Glycan Structure Prediction**: Once potential glycan attachment sites are identified, computational methods can be used to predict the structure of the attached glycans. This can involve database searches for known glycan structures that are commonly attached to the identified glycosylation sites, as well as modeling techniques to predict the specific glycan structures based on the protein context.

6. **Validation and Refinement**: Predicted glycan structures can be validated and refined using experimental data such as mass spectrometry analysis of glycopeptides or glycoproteins. This iterative process helps improve the accuracy of the predicted glycan structures.

Overall, computational methods for predicting glycan structure based on a DNA sequence involve a combination of sequence analysis, protein structure prediction, glycan attachment site prediction, glycan structure prediction, and validation steps.
