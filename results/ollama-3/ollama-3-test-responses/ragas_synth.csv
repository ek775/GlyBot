What are the limitations of glycomic analysis in understanding the glycome?

This question is relevant to the keyphrase ""Glycome analysis"" and can be fully addressed by considering the challenges mentioned in the context, such as the need for classical methods like tissue-section staining or flow cytometry to complement glycomic analysis, and the importance of taking into account the heterogeneity of glycosylation at the level of different cell types and subcellular domains.","['Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?  As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems. When that intellectual singularity is eventually achieved, further editions of this book may no longer be necessary.'
 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex.

This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'

""What is the major terminal modification found on sialylated N-linked glycans in Drosophila?""

Answer: LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc)","['Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis. The groups of Stuart Kornfeld and Kurt von Figura then found, surprisingly, that some of the M6P moieties were “blocked” by α-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to the phosphate residue, creating a phosphodiester. Comparison of glycans with phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters predicted that the metabolic precursor of the M6P determinant was a phosphodiester and that phosphorylation was mediated not by an ATP-dependent kinase but by a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This was proven using a double-labeled donor and Golgi extracts: Another Golgi enzyme phosphodiester glycosidase was shown to remove the outer N-acetylglucosamine residue and “uncover” the M6P moiety. Pulse-chase studies confirmed the order of events, documenting that multiple glycans on a given lysosomal enzyme could acquire one or two phosphate residues and that removal of some mannose residues on the N-glycan by processing Golgi mannosidases was also required (Figure 33.2). In most cell types, the phosphate is eventually lost after exposure to acid phosphatases 5 and 2 (ACP5, ACP2) in lysosomes. The overall biochemical pathway is shown in Figure 33.2. Pathways for biosynthesis of N-glycans bearing the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. Following early N-glycan processing (Chapter 9), a single GlcNAc phosphodiester is added to the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes on one of three mannose (Man) (more...) The first two enzymes that mediate these reactions were then purified and characterized and the encoding genes cloned. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-P-T) is an α2β2γ2 complex encoded by two genes. The α- and β-subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene, whose 1256 amino acid type-III transmembrane product undergoes proteolysis in the Golgi by site-1-protease (S1P) to give rise to the two subunits, whereas the 305 amino acid γ-subunit is encoded by the GNPTG gene (Figure 33.3). The α/β subunits contain the catalytic function of the enzyme (Stealth domains) as well as elements (Notch1, Notch2, and DMAP [DNA-methylase-associated protein]) that mediate binding to protein determinants present on the lysosomal enzymes. The γ-subunit facilitates the phosphorylation of a subset of the lysosomal enzymes. It contains an M6P receptor homology (MRH) domain that is thought to bind oligomannosyl N-glycans on the lysosomal enzymes and present them to the catalytic site for phosphorylation, and a DMAP recognition domain. The second enzyme, α-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester glycosidase encoded by the NAGPA gene, is a complex of four identical 68-kDa subunits, arranged as two disulfide-linked homodimers. Unlike other Golgi enzymes, this is a type-I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with its amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi. GlcNAc-P-T is an α2β2γ2 hexamer encoded by two genes. The GNPTAB gene encodes a catalytically inactive type 3 transmembrane precursor that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage between Lys-928 and Asp-929 in the Golgi by site-1-protease (more...) The oligomannosyl N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes are identical to those of many other glycoproteins passing through the ER–Golgi pathway. Thus, specific recognition by GlcNAc-P-T is crucial to achieve selective trafficking. This recognition is not explained by any similarities in the primary polypeptide sequences of lysosomal enzymes.'
 ""Binding to molecules carrying one M6P (Figure 33.2, structure D) is intermediate in affinity. Removal of outer mannose residues by processing Golgi mannosidases enhances binding. Genes encoding both MPRs have been cloned and extensively characterized. Both are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with extracytoplasmic, transmembrane, and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The CI-MPR has 15 contiguous repetitive units of ∼145 amino acids with partial identity to one another. The CD-MPR has a single extracellular domain, showing homology with the repeating domains of the CI-MPR (Figure 33.4A). Together with conservation of certain intron–exon boundaries, this homology suggests that the two genes evolved from a common ancestor. On the basis of their sequence relationships and unique binding properties to M6P, the two MPRs have been formally classified as P-type lectins. Structural homologs of the MPRs are present in yeast and Drosophila, but these proteins lack M6P-binding ability. (A) Schematic diagram of cation-independent (CI-MPR) and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CD-MPR). (B) Ribbon diagram of the bovine CD-MPR. Shown are the two monomers (magenta and cyan ribbons) of the dimer as well as the ligand M6P (gold (more...) The CD-MPR exists mainly as a dimer, with each monomer binding one M6P residue. The CI-MPR also seems to be a dimer in the membrane, although it readily dissociates on solubilization. Two of its repeating units (3 and 9) bind M6P phosphomonoesters with high affinity, a third (5) binds M6P phosphodiesters, and a fourth (15) binds both M6P phosphomonoesters and diesters with equal affinity. Mutagenesis studies have identified the specific residues of these receptors involved in M6P binding, and crystal structures of several M6P-binding domains have been obtained in complex with M6P. Comparison of the binding pockets reveals four residues (Gln, Arg, Glu, Tyr) are positionally conserved and form the same contacts with the mannose ring. The CD-MPR has been crystallized as a dimer, with each monomer folded into a nine-stranded flattened β-barrel that has a striking resemblance to the protein folds in avidin (Figure 33.4B). The distance between the two ligand-binding sites of the dimer provides a good explanation for the differences in binding affinity shown by the CD-MPR toward various lysosomal enzymes. Crystal structures of recombinant forms of the CI-MPR have also been solved that encompass all but two of the 15 contiguous domains in its extracellular region (i.e., domains 1–5, domains 7–11, and domains 11–14). Each domain shows a topology similar to that of the CD-MPR. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the CI-MPR isolated from bovine liver has been carried out under conditions: (1) not conducive to ligand binding (pH 4.5), and (2) found at the cell surface (pH 7.4) and bound to the non-glycosylated ligand, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) via CI-MPR's domain 11. Although the cryo-EM structure at pH 7.4 is unable to visualize the N- (domains 1–3) and C- (domain 15) termini with sufficient resolution, it does provide insight into the arrangement of the entire extracellular region of the CI-MPR. The proposed cryo-EM model does not position the two M6P-binding domains (3 and 9) sufficiently close to bind a single, diphosphorylated N-glycan. This suggests that the high-affinity binding of this N-glycan is due to the spanning of binding sites located on different monomers of the CI-MPR. An alternative possibility is that the receptor is dynamic, with the spacing between the two M6P-binding sites being flexible, to enhance interactions with lysosomal enzymes containing phosphorylated glycans at various positions on their protein backbones. The dynamic nature of the receptor is supported by structural and biophysical studies which show that the conformation of the CI-MPR is affected by pH. The CI-MPR adopts a more compact structure under acidic conditions that may facilitate unloading of lysosomal enzymes in the acidic environment of endosomal compartments.""

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""]",LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc),"The major terminal modification found on sialylated N-linked glycans in Drosophila is subterminal LacNAc instead of LacdiNAc, despite the presence of LacdiNAc terminated N-linked glycans.",,,0.6037697842947415,0.41618222496098234,0.05982905982905983,0.3333333333,,0.0,0.6388888888675925,,,
3,"Here's a question that can be fully answered from the given context:

What is one key difference between the interaction of FGF2 with heparin and the interaction of CCL5 with CS proteoglycans?

Answer: The key difference is that unlike FGF2, which does not undergo significant conformational change upon binding to heparin, CCL5 forms filamentous structures in the presence of CS proteoglycans.","['Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D. Esko, Victor Nizet, and the late Nathan Sharon and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek and Ajit Varki.'
 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution.

As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems.

 'Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage. H. pylori also expresses Lewis x–containing structures in the O-antigen of its LPS, which resemble Lewis x–modified glycans on the surface of parietal cells in the gastric lining. This Lewis antigen mimicry can be varied through the expression of two variable α1,3 fucosyltransferases, FutA and FutB. Similar to B. thetaiotaomicron, H. pylori has also developed mechanisms to obtain fucose from its host. The presence of H. pylori stimulates the host to secrete α-L-fucosidase 2 (FUCA2). This, in turn, increases the expression of the Lewis x–containing LPS O-antigen in H. pylori. Variation in both organism and host in the expression of Lewis x glycan structures and/or the adhesins may help explain the wide range of potential clinical outcomes following colonization by H. pylori. This chapter provides only a glimpse of the diverse roles glycans play in the interactions between individual viruses and bacteria with their hosts. As scientists explore varying environments and their associated microbial communities (which also include parasites, fungi, and bacteriophages), it is becoming increasingly apparent that glycans influence every aspect of these interactions and there remains so much more to discover.

Esko and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek.']","Some of these strategies include glycan-binding proteins recognizing specific glycans on glycoproteins or glycolipids, allowing for adhesion, invasion, and colonization. Glycans can also serve as decoys or receptor mimics, blocking the interaction between the host's immune system and its target cells. Additionally, glycosyltransferases modify the glycans of pathogens or parasites to create new epitopes that evade recognition by the host's immune system, while glycan-based molecular mimicry promotes further host cell damage through glycan-lectin interactions.","Pathogens have evolved various strategies to evade host immune responses, including direct or indirect appropriation of host glycans, convergent evolution toward similar biosynthetic pathways, and even lateral gene transfer.

6,"Here's a question that can be fully answered from the given context:

""What is necessary for the receipt of an N-glycan on proteins?""

Answer: ""The presence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons encoded by an mRNA, which are referred to as potential N-glycan sites.","['Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?  As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems. When that intellectual singularity is eventually achieved, further editions of this book may no longer be necessary.'
 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

7,What is the primary application of magnetic nanoparticles in clinical practice?,"['Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 ""In many cases, HS is a coreceptor, initiating attachment before recruitment of other host receptor proteins that support viral entry. A prominent example is HSV-1, also known as human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), one of the eight currently known human herpesviruses that cause widespread disease. HSV-1 establishes latent, recurrent infections of mucous membranes, particularly lesions of the mouth and lips (cold sores, fever blisters) but also of genital tract and cornea, the latter of which may cause blindness. Unlike most other viruses, in which host cell binding and entry are mediated by one or two viral proteins, herpesvirus entry requires several viral entry glycoproteins, some of which are shared among all herpesvirus family members. One shared viral glycoprotein, gB, initiates virus attachment by binding to cell-surface HS, as does gC in HSV-1. Once bound, the virus “surfs” the cell surface until it encounters other receptors, including a specific HS structure, 3-O-sulfation on GlcNAc. This relatively rare HS modification induces binding of gD, another glycoprotein shared in the herpesvirus family. Once gD binds, it recruits additional proteins required for fusion and host cell entry. Removal of HS from cell surfaces enzymatically or by selection of mutant cells defective in HS expression renders the cells resistant to HSV-1 infection by reducing virus attachment. Soluble heparin and HS mimetics inhibit viral infection by masking the HS-binding domain on the virus envelope. Immobilized HS columns bind to the HSV-1 viral entry proteins gB and gC, and HSV-1 deletion mutants lacking gB and gC exhibit impaired virus binding. Genetic evidence of a role of 3-O-sulfation of HS GlcNAc in HSV-1 infection was obtained by altering the expression of 3-O-sulfotransferase genes in cells and living organisms. Recent evidence suggests that up-regulation of the host's own heparanase helps newly budded HSV-1 to disseminate to neighboring cells, analogous to the role of influenza neuraminidase. Although the herpesviruses have evolved much more complex systems for host cell binding and entry, some of which remain to be established, it is clear that HS plays important roles in viral pathogenesis. HIV is a retrovirus and the etiologic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a pandemic disease affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. HIV is an enveloped virus with a surface dominated by spikes made of two proteins, gp120 and gp41, of which gp120 mediates viral attachment to host cells, primarily CD4+ T cells, by binding to the host cell-surface receptor CD4 and a chemokine receptor coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4. HIV gp120 is heavily glycosylated, with N-linked glycans comprising half of the spike mass and densely covering much of the spike surface. Dense glycosylation is thought to aid in immune evasion by masking the underlying polypeptide. However, gp120 glycans also actively support infection by co-opting host lectins, including C-type lectins on DCs (Chapter 34). DCs are innate immune cells that capture and present antigens to T cells to initiate adaptive immunity. DCs capture antigens, in part, using C-type lectins that bind to glycan determinants common to pathogens but uncommon on host cells. Although DCs are not numerous, they are important in recognizing and presenting pathogen antigens to the adaptive immune system. DCs that reside in submucosal tissues of the vagina and rectum are early targets for HIV. Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods.""

 'Diagnostic fragment ions can sometimes be found confirming terminal epitopes such as a fucosylated Hex-HexNAc or sialylated fucosylated Hex-HexNAc (Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis x, respectively) but these cannot be distinguished from Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis a. Detailed glycan profiling achieved with site resolution (structure-focused glycoproteomics) is an important frontier that should be a goal of the next-generation of glycoproteomics. At this time, continued development of selective enrichment and/or preseparation of specific subsets of glycopeptides needs to be pursued, because no single LC-MSn method or instrument is sufficient to handle the full dynamic range of the entire glycopeptide pool derived from a complete glycoproteome. To limit the search space and enhance the detailed structural knowledge of the glycans encountered in a given glycoproteome, parallel profiling of the glycome can be performed. Such a “glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics” approach (Figure 51.2) can also be complemented with quantitative proteome and de-glycoproteome profiling (mapping of glycosylation sites), which reduce the search space even further and provide supporting evidence to pinpoint the mechanism(s) driving the observed glycoproteome alterations. Although glycoproteomics is rapidly maturing and continues to reach a larger group of scientists, significant analytical challenges remain and the technology is still best performed in “specialist” laboratories because of the demand for manual expert interrogation and interpretation of data. Current glycoproteomics methods cannot identify the full complement of glycans on every site of a mixture of glycoproteins and cannot easily tackle multiply glycosylated peptides especially with both N- and O-linked glycan structures. Defining the relative proportions of different intact glycoform populations is important for understanding biological function. This has only been achieved in a few cases (e.g., by MS analysis of the intact IgG glycoprotein). Several promising informatics initiatives aimed at automating the glycopeptide identification process, aiding the quantitation, and supporting the interpretation of the data output have appeared over recent years. A recent interlaboratory study conducted by the Human Glycoproteomics Initiative of HUPO highlights the importance of different software search parameters for the successful identification and characterization of glycopeptides in order to try to deal with false positives and the reporting of thousands of nonverified glycopeptides. At this stage, for most of the available glycopeptide identification software tools it is strongly advised that manual validation of the glycopeptide assignments still be performed to generate sufficient confidence in the reported identifications. It is therefore clear that the computational solutions require further improvements to advance the field of glycoproteomics and ultimately achieve full integration among other disciplines within the glycosciences (Chapter 52).

For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface.

 'Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage. H. pylori also expresses Lewis x–containing structures in the O-antigen of its LPS, which resemble Lewis x–modified glycans on the surface of parietal cells in the gastric lining. This Lewis antigen mimicry can be varied through the expression of two variable α1,3 fucosyltransferases, FutA and FutB. Similar to B. thetaiotaomicron, H. pylori has also developed mechanisms to obtain fucose from its host. The presence of H. pylori stimulates the host to secrete α-L-fucosidase 2 (FUCA2). This, in turn, increases the expression of the Lewis x–containing LPS O-antigen in H. pylori. Variation in both organism and host in the expression of Lewis x glycan structures and/or the adhesins may help explain the wide range of potential clinical outcomes following colonization by H. pylori. This chapter provides only a glimpse of the diverse roles glycans play in the interactions between individual viruses and bacteria with their hosts. As scientists explore varying environments and their associated microbial communities (which also include parasites, fungi, and bacteriophages), it is becoming increasingly apparent that glycans influence every aspect of these interactions and there remains so much more to discover.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

What role do galectins play in innate immune functions?","['This covalent approach avoided oxidative “cutting” and provided filled-and-functionalized glycosylated CNTs for in vivo applications. CNTs can be considered “1D hollow pores” with an associated capillarity. Through capillary action, molten salts or their solutions can be encapsulated inside CNTs. Glyco-CNTs were used for encapsulation of the radioemitter Na125I and in vivo localization of high levels of this radionuclide. Multiple copies of GlcNAc improved both water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Thanks to the high aspect ratio and surface area to volume ratio of such CNTs, sugars can be efficiently displayed in a multivalent format (Figure 58.4). These glyco-CNTs are alternative radiotracers for in vivo imaging or radiation-delivery systems with high radioisotope-loading capacity and high sensitivity. The rapid uptake of iodide by the mammalian thyroid served as a test of any potential leakage of radioactive iodide “cargo.” Although “free” iodide 125I rapidly entered the thyroid, iodide encapsulated in the glyco-CNT remained at its target site even after a month.

(Adapted from Hong SY, et al. 2010. Nat Mater 9: 485−490.)  The chemical flexibility of graphene-based materials allowed for the formation of dynamic supramolecular constructs. A carbohydrate-functionalized two-dimensional (2D) surface was prepared by decorating thermally reduced graphene sheets with multivalent sugar ligands. Host–guest inclusion provided a versatile strategy to present biofunctional ligands on the carbon surface. The multivalent sugar-functionalized graphene sheet agglutinates bacteria and inhibits their motility. Taking advantage of the supramolecular design, the captured bacteria can be partially released by adding a competitive guest. The unique thermal IR-absorption properties of graphene allow for the killing of the captured bacteria by IR-laser irradiation of the captured graphene–sugar–E. coli complex. Dendrimers are nanosized branched compounds that can be decorated with ligands, permitting control over their number and orientation. Several scaffolds based on organic molecules, metal complexes, and supramolecular assemblies have been exploited for the formation of multivalent glycodendrimers to study lectin-binding properties. “Click” chemistry and amide bond formation have been used to tether sugar molecules to the dendrimer scaffold. Mannose-conjugated glycodendrimers bind specifically to ConA. Galactose functionalized dendrimeric arms have been conjugated to β-cyclodextrin (βCD). The βCD can incorporate either a drug, such as doxorubicin, or a fluorescent dye, to monitor the uptake of the dendrimeric structure. Specific delivery of doxorubicin to hepatocytes was achieved with the help of targeting galactose units. Metal complexes like Ru(bpy)3 were also employed as scaffold for the assembly of three-dimensional supramolecular glycodendrimers. βCDs decorated with seven mannose functional groups were bound, via hydrophobic interactions, to the ruthenium core appended with adamantyl groups. The resulting supramolecular assemblies bind E. coli that express mannose receptors in the bacterial pili. Supramolecular glycodendrimers have been prepared to display carbohydrates in a defined manner, offering controlled multivalency. Supramolecular particles, vesicles, or fibers have been created, offering a dynamic representation of a biological system. Synthetic molecules that mimic glycolipids self-assembled into nanovesicles displaying oligomannosides on their outer surface, resembling the glycocalyx coating of eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. The supramolecular approach permitted the formation of raft-like nanomorphologies on the synthetic vesicle that could shine light on important binding mechanisms. Glycodendrimers can also be combined with particles to create multiple levels of multivalency. In one example, glycodendrimers displayed on protein-derived particles (virus-like particles) allowed for picomolar inhibition of Ebola virus–related adhesion events. Natural polysaccharides are very useful for the preparation of nanosized carriers. The low toxicity, biocompatibility, stability, low cost, hydrophilic nature, and availability of reactive sites for chemical modification render polysaccharides attractive building blocks for pharmaceutical applications.'
 'For example, on photoinduced retinal damage in the zebrafish, galectin-1 is one of the first proteins secreted by stem cells in the Müller glia, and is responsible for rod regeneration. Galectin-7 is important in the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis and skin repair. Several galectins induce apoptosis in some types of blood cells. For galectin-1, this activity has been studied mostly in human T cells, particularly Th1 and Th17 cells, in which apoptotic pathways may involve cell-surface glycoproteins, including CD7, CD29, CD45, and CD43. In contrast, for galectin-3 induction of apoptosis in T cells involves CD71 and CD45. In some cells, apoptotic signaling may function through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspases. The interactions of galectin-9 with Tim-3 on Th1 cells may induce their apoptosis. In addition, some galectins, such as galectins-1, -2, and -4, also can induce exposure of cell-surface phosphatidylserine independently of apoptotic events. Moreover, overexpression of intracellular galectin-3 shows antiapoptotic activity, whereas overexpression of galectins-7 and -12 may promote apoptosis in cells. Some potential intracellular binding partners of galectins, especially for galectin-3, include several proteins involved in regulating apoptosis, such as Bcl-2, Fas receptor (CD95), synexin (a Ca++- and phospholipid-binding protein), and Alix/Alg-2. Many tumors overexpress various galectins and their heightened expression usually correlates with clinical aggressiveness of the tumor as well as progression to a metastatic phenotype. The immunosuppressive effects of galectin-1 can contribute to tumor survival, as revealed by knockdown studies, in which decreased galectin-1 expression is associated with decreased tumor survival, owing to increased survival of interferon- γ (IFN-γ)-producing Th1 cells and heightened T cell–mediated tumor rejection. Studies using galectin-1 knockout cell lines and mice have shown that expression of galectin-1 in tumor cell endothelium is essential for tumor angiogenesis, based on the binding of galectin-1 to complex N-glycans on VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and activation of VEGF-like signaling. Thus, galectins play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis through indirect effects in regulating tumor immune responses and direct effects in tumor angiogenesis. Although silencing of galectin-3 expression by methylation of its promoter is associated with early stages of prostate cancer, overexpression of galectin-3 correlates well with neoplastic transformation and tumor progression toward metastasis. Galectins are important as regulators of immune and inflammatory responses. Galectins are expressed by a number of different immune and inflammatory cells. In addition, galectins can promote pro- or anti-inflammatory responses, depending on the inflammatory stimulus, microenvironment, and the target cell. Immune cell responses to galectins also depend on the specific glycosylation of surface glycoproteins to generate galectin ligands. However, many of these functions were shown by using recombinant galectins added to cultured cells. Whether these reflect the functions of endogenous galectins is not well understood. Galectin-3, through its multivalent interactions, can form lattices with cell-surface glycoproteins—for example, with T-cell receptor (TCR) and the immune synapse (e.g., the interface between an antigen-presenting cell and a T/B cell or natural killer cell). Expression of such N-glycans is partly regulated by branching of N-glycans through β6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5). Mgat5 null T cells show enhanced clustering of TCRs suggesting that branched N-glycans interacting with galectin-3 may normally restrict TCR clustering and serve as a hindrance to the development of T-cell responses. The nature of glycan branching, interactions with galectins and perhaps other multivalent lectins, as well as metabolic regulation are intertwined. Interestingly, subcutaneous injections of recombinant human galectins-1 and -9 can reduce the severity of several autoimmune diseases in various animal models, but the underlying mechanisms for these in vivo immunosuppressive activities are unclear. Studies of mice deficient in a certain galectin indicate that galectins have roles in immune responses and inflammation.'
 ""Furthermore, several polymorphisms within the promoter region of MBL2 are associated with MBL deficiency and enhanced susceptibility to infections. Genetic variants of MBL2 are also associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, polymorphisms in MASP1 and MASP2 are associated with altered serum levels and compromised activity of collectins. Activation of these proteases can also lead to prothrombin cleavage and promote clot formation. Myeloid cells, which include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs, have a large number of proteins with CTLDs, which belong mainly to groups 2, 5, and 6 (Figure 34.3). Myeloid cells also express many members of the galectin and Siglec families of lectins. All leukocytes express L-selectin (group 4), which is discussed below in a separate section on selectins. Group 2 CTLs are DC-SIGN (in humans, but there is no murine homolog), CD209a (also termed SIGN-R1 in mice, but there is no human homolog), macrophage CTL (MCL), dectin-2 (DC-associated C-type lectin-2), langerin, the macrophage galactose-binding lectin (MGL), DCIR and the macrophage inducible Ca++-dependent lectin (MINCLE) (CLEC4E); in group 5, Ca++-independent lectin dectin-1, LOX-1, CLEC12B, CLEC9A (DNGR-1), myeloid-DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1), CLEC-1, CLEC-2, and dendritic cell–associated lectin-1 (DCAL-1); and in group 6, Ca++-dependent macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) and DEC-205 (CD205). There are approximately 20 members of the natural killer (NK) cell receptor group 5 of CTLD-containing proteins in humans, and additional ones in mice. Many of the genes encoding the NK cell receptor group 5 are present on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 6. The dectin-1 cluster that is part of the NK gene complex of CTLDs (mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 12) includes dectin-1 (CLEC7A), CLEC-1 (CLEC1A), CLEC-2 (CLEC1B), LOX-1 (OLR), CLEC12b, and CLEC9A. These CTLD-containing receptors bind various ligands such as glycans, but also proteins, lipids, inorganic compounds, and even ice. The dectin-2 cluster of CTLDs (whose genes are clustered in the centromeric region of the NK gene cluster) and represent group 2 CTLs includes dectin-2 (CLEC6A), blood DC antigen 2 (BDCA-2) (CLEC4C), DC immunoactivating receptor (DCAR) Clec4b in mice, absent in humans), DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) (CLEC4A), CTL superfamily 8 (CLECSF8) (CLEC4D), and MINCLE (CLEC4E). Mice have the Ly49 family of receptors that contain CTLDs and are on murine chromosome 6. But the Ly49 members, also termed Ly49 NK cell receptors, may not bind sugar but primarily bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and MHC class I–like molecules expressed by viruses. These are most functionally related to the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in human NK cells and some T cells. Numerous myeloid proteins with CTLDs can recognize not only pathogen moieties for host defense, but also modified self-antigens such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dead cells. The glycan and nonglycan ligands for the myeloid CTLs are diverse. MINCLE can recognize characteristic PAMPs such as α-mannose-containing glycans and trehalose-6,6-dimycolate, a key glycolipid virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, and thus induce immune responses against infection. MINCLE also maintains self-homeostasis and monitors the internal environment by sensing damaged cells by recognizing SAP130, a component of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and the intracellular metabolite beta-glucosylceramide (β-GlcCer) both exposed by dying cells.""

 'Although the fut-8 gene encodes an enzyme with the same specificity as the mammalian FUT8 α1-6 fucosyltransferases, two α1-3 fucosyltransferases (FUT-1 and FUT-6) with unusual substrate preferences transfer fucose to the proximal and distal core GlcNAc residues; whereas FUT-1, unlike plant and insect core α1-3 fucosyltransferases, cannot transfer to glycans with a β1-2GlcNAc on the α1-3-mannose, the action of FUT-6 is blocked by the presence of α1-6-mannose. Activity of recombinant forms of two α1-2 fucosyltransferases and a fucose-modifying β1-4-galactosyltransferase (GALT-1) have also been reported. In terms of peptide-modifying glycosyltransferases, 11 of the nematode UDP-GalNAc polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs) that modify Ser/Thr residues of mucin core polypeptides have been prepared as recombinant proteins, but only five of them are active toward mammalian peptide acceptors. Additionally, the C. elegans β1-3 galactosyltransferase (T-synthase), which generates the core 1 O-glycan structure common to vertebrates (Chapter 10), has been characterized. The single C. elegans cytosolic or nuclear O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and the GAG-initiating O-xylosyltransferase homologs as well as its POFUT1 and 2 O-fucosyltransferases have been characterized at the biochemical and genetic levels. C. elegans can also synthesize the canonical core tetrasaccharide of GAGs, GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-Ser, and can extend this to generate CS and HS. In the case of HS biosynthesis, there are numerous sulfotransferases and an HS epimerase, but fewer chondroitin-modifying enzymes, in C. elegans. The genes required for initiation of the unusual arthroseries glycolipid core structure (Manβ1-4Glcβ1-Cer) are also known, but C. elegans lacks the β1-4 galactosyltransferase that would synthesize the more familiar Galβ1-4Glcβ1-Cer glycolipid core. Expression of the known glycosyltransferases in C. elegans has not been systematically mapped at the cellular level during development or in the adult organism. Many of the relevant studies are based on promoter analyses using GFP as a reporter. Therefore, the promoter region for a gene of interest (usually 0.5–1.5 kb upstream of the gene and sometimes including the upstream elements and the first few exons of the gene) is ligated to the cDNA encoding GFP. Transgenic animals are then produced by direct injection of DNA into the hermaphrodite gonad. Newly developing animals take up this DNA and become transgenic. Thus, one can observe promoter utilization in the different stages of development (see Figure 25.2). Using this approach, it has been found that some glycosyltransferase genes are widely expressed, including the T-synthase, which generates core 1 O-glycans (Figure 25.4), the SQV-2 involved in GAG biosynthesis (Figure 25.5), and the two protein O-fucosyltransferases POFUT1 and POFUT2. In contrast, expression of the six individual glycosyltransferases related to core-2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in vertebrates (see Chapter 10) is tissue-specific; one such gene, gly-15, is expressed only in two gland cells. Relevant to N-glycan biosynthesis, promoter analyses show that gly-12 and gly-13 are expressed in all cells beginning in embryogenesis, whereas gly-14 is expressed only in intestinal cells from L1 to adults; the aman-2 gene is expressed in most cells of the organism. Among the 26 α1-2FucTs that are predicted in C. elegans, one of them (CE2FT-1; FUT-2) is expressed in a single cell in embryos and exclusively in 20 intestinal cells of larval stages L1–L4 and adult worms.']",The text does not mention galectins or their role in innate immune functions.,Galectins have been revealed to play roles as pattern recognition receptors and effector factors in innate immune functions by recognizing glycans on the surface of potential pathogens and parasites.,,,0.6808982577994538,0.7225862242529196,0.02727272727272727,0.6388888888675925,,0.0,0.6388888888675925,,,
12,"Here's a question that can be fully answered from the given context:

What are the effects of GALT deficiency on the symptoms and biochemical abnormalities in galactosemia patients?","[""In many cases, HS is a coreceptor, initiating attachment before recruitment of other host receptor proteins that support viral entry. A prominent example is HSV-1, also known as human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), one of the eight currently known human herpesviruses that cause widespread disease. HSV-1 establishes latent, recurrent infections of mucous membranes, particularly lesions of the mouth and lips (cold sores, fever blisters) but also of genital tract and cornea, the latter of which may cause blindness. Unlike most other viruses, in which host cell binding and entry are mediated by one or two viral proteins, herpesvirus entry requires several viral entry glycoproteins, some of which are shared among all herpesvirus family members. One shared viral glycoprotein, gB, initiates virus attachment by binding to cell-surface HS, as does gC in HSV-1. Once bound, the virus “surfs” the cell surface until it encounters other receptors, including a specific HS structure, 3-O-sulfation on GlcNAc. This relatively rare HS modification induces binding of gD, another glycoprotein shared in the herpesvirus family. Once gD binds, it recruits additional proteins required for fusion and host cell entry. Removal of HS from cell surfaces enzymatically or by selection of mutant cells defective in HS expression renders the cells resistant to HSV-1 infection by reducing virus attachment. Soluble heparin and HS mimetics inhibit viral infection by masking the HS-binding domain on the virus envelope. Immobilized HS columns bind to the HSV-1 viral entry proteins gB and gC, and HSV-1 deletion mutants lacking gB and gC exhibit impaired virus binding. Genetic evidence of a role of 3-O-sulfation of HS GlcNAc in HSV-1 infection was obtained by altering the expression of 3-O-sulfotransferase genes in cells and living organisms. Recent evidence suggests that up-regulation of the host's own heparanase helps newly budded HSV-1 to disseminate to neighboring cells, analogous to the role of influenza neuraminidase. Although the herpesviruses have evolved much more complex systems for host cell binding and entry, some of which remain to be established, it is clear that HS plays important roles in viral pathogenesis. HIV is a retrovirus and the etiologic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a pandemic disease affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. HIV is an enveloped virus with a surface dominated by spikes made of two proteins, gp120 and gp41, of which gp120 mediates viral attachment to host cells, primarily CD4+ T cells, by binding to the host cell-surface receptor CD4 and a chemokine receptor coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4. HIV gp120 is heavily glycosylated, with N-linked glycans comprising half of the spike mass and densely covering much of the spike surface. Dense glycosylation is thought to aid in immune evasion by masking the underlying polypeptide. However, gp120 glycans also actively support infection by co-opting host lectins, including C-type lectins on DCs (Chapter 34). DCs are innate immune cells that capture and present antigens to T cells to initiate adaptive immunity. DCs capture antigens, in part, using C-type lectins that bind to glycan determinants common to pathogens but uncommon on host cells. Although DCs are not numerous, they are important in recognizing and presenting pathogen antigens to the adaptive immune system. DCs that reside in submucosal tissues of the vagina and rectum are early targets for HIV. Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods.""
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication.

Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","I'm happy to help!

Among the 26 α1-2FucTs that are predicted in C. elegans, one of them (CE2FT-1; FUT-2) is expressed in a single cell in embryos and exclusively in 20 intestinal cells of larval stages L1–L4 and adult worms.'
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""
 ""A defect in GDP-fucose biosynthesis caused by a mutation in the bre-1 gene results in resistance to some fungal toxic lectins; furthermore, mutations in genes encoding the FUT-1, -6, and -8 core fucosyltransferases, the GALT-1 galactosyltransferase, the HEX-2 and HEX-3 hexosaminidases, or the SAMT-1 transporter (the latter required for glycan methylation) are associated with altered susceptibility to proteins expressed by nematoxic fungi. C. elegans is also an interesting model system to study infection and innate immunity. The organism may be colonized by different bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The two Yersinia species generate a sticky biofilm (an exopolysaccharide matrix encasing a community of bacteria) on the exterior of the worm's head that impairs viability. P. aeruginosa, in contrast, colonizes the intestinal tissues. Another bacterium, Microbacterium nematophilum, sticks to the anus of the animals and induces an irritation in the underlying hypodermal tissue. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) infection leads to destruction of the intestine, which is discussed in more detail below in regard to glycolipids. Mutations in the worm, some of them affecting glycosylation processes, have been found that affect colonization by these bacteria. Examples of such mutants include those with defects in bus genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases. An especially interesting set of mutations are the srf mutants (altered surface antigenicity mutants). Some of the srf mutants were identified by altered antibody or lectin binding to the cuticle, indicating that loss of cuticle components exposed new antigens. srf-3 mutants are resistant to infection by M. nematophilum and lack some O-linked glycoconjugates containing glucuronic acid and galactose as well as reduced levels of some N-glycans. srf-3 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter that can transport both UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting that altered sugar composition of the cuticle resulting from mutations in this transporter confer resistance to M. nematophilum. Interestingly, there are 18 putative nucleotide sugar transporters (Chapter 5) in the genome of C. elegans, which is a considerably larger number than the known nucleotide sugars (UDP-galactose, UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, UDP-xylose, GDP-mannose, and GDP-fucose), suggesting possible functional overlap in these transporters. During egg laying, fertilized eggs must pass through the vulva, which is a simple tubular structure that links the gonads with the external cuticle. During postembryonic development, vulva morphogenesis arises through the invagination of a single layer of epithelial cells. Using mutagenesis, several mutations that perturb invagination of the vulva were identified (designated sqv or squashed vulva). In the original screen, 25 mutations were identified in eight genes named sqv-1 through sqv-8. All of the mutations produced a similar phenotype: that is, partial collapse of vulval invagination, elongation of the central vulval cells, hermaphrodite sterility associated with maternal-effect lethality, and cytokinesis defects in the early embryo. All eight sqv genes show homology with vertebrate enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of GAGs (Figure 25.5). sqv-1, sqv-4, and sqv-7 encode proteins that have roles in nucleotide sugar metabolism and transport. The SQV-7 nucleotide transporter was the first example of a carrier that could import more than one nucleotide sugar into the Golgi (Chapter 5). SQV-4 and SQV-1 proteins represent sequential enzymes involved in the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-xylose, respectively, showing that the sqv mutations most likely affect GAG synthesis. Biochemical analysis of sqv-6, sqv-3, sqv-2, and sqv-8 showed that they encode worm orthologs of the vertebrate transferases required for the assembly of the linkage region tetrasaccharide common to HS and chondroitin. Finally, characterization of sqv-5 showed that it encodes the chondroitin synthase, which acts in concert with the chondroitin polymerizing factor encoded by the mig-22 gene.""]","There is no answer to this question because it is not supported by the given context information.

14,What factors contribute to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species?,"['Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D. Esko, Victor Nizet, and the late Nathan Sharon and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek and Ajit Varki.'
 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5).

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'

This chapter illustrates and discusses some key mechanisms by which glycans influence the pathogenesis and progression of bacterial and viral infections and describes examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Infectious diseases remain a major cause of death, disability, and social and economic disorder for millions of people throughout the world. Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host. Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors. A human in good health is colonized by as many as 1013 bacteria on the skin and mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, a number that resembles the number of cells in our own body. Despite all these direct and continuous encounters, it is relatively rare that bacteria invade into the tissues to produce serious infections. Although not restricted to pathogenic species/strains, one feature shared by many of these disease-causing agents is the presence of diverse polysaccharide capsule structures, which encapsulate bacteria (Chapter 21). These structures can have many biological properties, both stimulating and thwarting immune detection in different settings. Capsules make key contributions to the virulence of multiple bacterial pathogens, reducing recognition by the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, capsular polysaccharides are also commonly the natural targets of the adaptive immune system. In fact, antibodies specific to different capsule structures often define the serology used to differentiate subtypes of particular bacterial species. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) encodes perhaps the most historically significant capsule in biology and medicine. Pioneering experiments by Frederick Griffith in 1928 showed the in vivo transfer of virulence from a dead encapsulated (smooth) disease-causing strain to an avirulent, nonencapsulated (rough) strain. Studies regarding immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharides (Figure 42.1) provided the framework for the discoveries of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, which showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information.

Killing of bacteria by phagocytes of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils or macrophages, is aided by opsonization, a process in which the bacterial surface is tagged with complement proteins or specific antibodies. Phagocytes express receptors for activated complement and antibody Fc domains, allowing them to bind, engulf, and kill bacteria. Together these processes are referred to as opsonophagocytosis. Genetic mutagenesis of capsule biosynthesis genes and infectious challenge in small animal models have illustrated the roles of bacterial capsules in resisting opsonophagocytosis. Compared with the wild-type parent bacterial strains, isogenic capsule-deficient mutants of group A Streptococcus (GAS), group B Streptococcus (GBS), pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), and several other important human pathogens are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by opsonophagocytosis and fail to establish systemic infection.'
 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Cristina De Castro and Christopher Mark West.'
 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","Functional constraints, phylogenetic trends, selection pressures, molecular mimicry, and evolutionary innovation.","The factors contributing to the evolutionary persistence of glycan structure and function in distinct but related species include conservation of specific functional constraints for glycans, considerable evolutionary drift in glycan structure that might be tolerated as long as the underlying protein can carry out its primary functions, key roles of glycans in mediating interactions with symbionts and pathogens, providing additional obstacles to pathogens, attracting and feeding symbiotic microbial communities, accommodating or restricting these to particular areas of the host, significant variation among members of the same species, particularly in terminal glycan sequences, balancing (frequency-dependent) selection exerted by pathogens recognizing glycans as targets for attachment and entry into cells, antibody-mediated protection from intracellular but enveloped viruses, possible frequency-dependent protection from glycan-exploiting extracellular pathogens.",,0.8695171576150054,0.4028043456224899,0.7586342718203523,0.010309278350515464,0.8055555555287036,,0.16666666638888888,0.8041666666465626,1.0,1.0,1.0

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.30 Jesús Angulo, Jochen Zimmer, Anne Imberty, and James H. Prestegard. The biological effects that glycans elicit are frequently dependent on recognition of specific glycan features by the proteins with which they interact. In this chapter, some of the key structural features underlying glycan–protein interactions, as well as the primary experimental methods that have led to an understanding of these features, are discussed, specifically X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cryo-electron microscopy, and computational modeling. As emphasized in previous chapters, the numbers of distinct glycans produced by various organisms are enormous, but at the same time, glycans lack the diversity in functional groups displayed by other molecules. To achieve specificity in glycan recognition, proteins rely as much on the stereospecific placement of glycan hydroxyl groups at chiral centers, use of different linkage sites, and extensive branching as they rely on specific modifications of hydroxyl groups by processes such as sulfation, phosphorylation, and esterification. This puts placement of various residues and functional groups in three dimensions at a premium. Building a three-dimensional picture of how recognition of glycans by proteins occurs is therefore essential if we are to understand how glycans are synthesized and recognized in the many physiological and pathological processes they control. It is also essential if we are to use knowledge of glycan recognition as a basis for the production of therapeutic agents that can control these processes in the event of disease. Building a structure depicting glycan recognition is not without its challenges. Most glycans are highly dynamic in solution, sampling many conformations. Often, a single or a small subset of conformations is selected when a complex forms. This works against the formation of stable complexes for structural studies and the direct use of solution conformational data in defining conformations of bound glycans. The search for a structural basis of glycan recognition by proteins is not new. The concept of glycans fitting into pockets on protein surfaces dates back to Emil Fischer, who used the phrase “lock and key” to refer to enzymes that recognize specific glycan substrates. Lysozyme was the first “carbohydrate-binding protein” to be crystallized and have its three-dimensional structure determined. Subsequent work in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a structure complexed with a tetrasaccharide that confirmed the existence of specific interactions occurring between sugars and proteins, and the ability of proteins to select the appropriate “key” from numerous possibilities. Today, protein crystallography has reached a very high degree of sophistication and is responsible for the vast majority of the more than 170,000 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB); however, producing a structure with ligands in place is still challenging. The structures that exist tend to have ligands that are relatively small and interact with particularly high binding constants. Glycan recognition frequently involves contacts with multiple residues to achieve specificity. So, native glycan ligands are often larger than other types of ligands. Often, high avidity is achieved through multivalent interactions, in which case the affinity for an isolated ligand–protein interaction is small. Nevertheless, there are a significant number of crystal structures for glycan–protein complexes, and these have contributed greatly to our understanding of the types of interactions that make glycan recognition possible. Structural information on bound glycan ligands that is complementary to that from X-ray crystallography is increasingly coming from NMR methods. This is particularly valuable in that it is applicable to ligands with a broader range of affinities, including many that have the lower affinities amplified in multivalent interactions. It is also applicable in solution under near-physiological conditions in which concerns about the effects of crystal lattice contacts and occlusion of some interaction sites are absent. It is even possible to conduct some experiments on assemblies that mimic a membrane surface environment, an environment in which many protein–glycan interactions occur. It is important to note that structural methodology is continually evolving, with additional information coming from techniques like small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Recent advances in cryo-EM provide many exciting opportunities to study protein–glycan interactions, which will also be discussed.'
 'Ideally, the saturation effect diffuses all over the protein protons and eventually is transferred to ligand protons close to the protein surface, and the resonances of these protons are reduced in intensity in a way that inversely correlates with the distances of a proton from the protein surface. Data are collected as a difference between one-dimensional proton spectra with and without saturation in the extremes of the protein spectrum. The resulting difference spectrum is dominated by resonances from the ligand that have contact with the protein. Mapping the position of protons assigned to these resonances onto a ligand structure allows depiction of the ligand binding epitope. Figure 30.4 shows an example that probes the interaction between a complex N-glycan (Chapters 3 and 9) and an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody. These antibodies specifically interact with surface glycans of HIV and are effective in inhibiting binding of the virus to target cells. Hence, there has been significant interest in exactly which glycans are recognized. Antibodies are large glycosylated proteins that are not usually amenable to NMR investigation by isotope-dependent methods, but STD NMR methods are applicable. The example uses a sample 20 µm in protein (Fab fragment) and 2 mm in glycan. Normal (reference) and STD NMR spectra are superimposed to show the saturated ligand resonances, which include some that come specifically from the Neu5Ac residues (Sia) on the termini of the glycan branches. Binding epitope identification in a complex-type glycan bound to the HIV-1 neutralizing antibody PG16 using saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information. (Reproduced from Bewley CA, Shahzad-ul-Hussan S. 2013. Biopolymers (more...) STD NMR applications involving long-chain multiantenna N-glycans, such as the one described above, are often hampered by the near-chemical equivalence of sites and degeneracy of resonances from the various branches of antenna. In these cases, the covalent attachment of lanthanide binding tags to the reducing end of the glycan has proven useful. The resulting dispersion of glycan signals due to pseudo-contact shifts can allow unambiguous determination of binding epitopes (see Further Reading). Although the rapid dispersion of saturation throughout the protein in standard STD NMR experiments suppresses information about what protein residues are involved in binding, there are ways to retrieve some of this information. In multifrequency STD NMR spectra, as in the case of the differential-epitope-mapping method (DEEP-STD NMR), two STD NMR spectra are obtained using two very different saturating frequencies in spectral regions devoid of glycan signals—for example, one in the aromatic region of protein protons and the other in the aliphatic region. In each STD NMR spectrum, the ligand protons close to directly saturated protein protons (e.g., aromatic protons) show a little increase in STD intensity, in comparison to protons further away from the saturated protein protons. Analyzing and mapping those differences along the structure of the ligand (so-called differential epitope mapping) allows retrieval of information about which areas of the glycan interact with those different types of amino acids in the binding pocket. If the geometry of the pocket is known, this allows elucidation of the orientation or polarity of the glycan in the binding pocket. The above provides a glimpse of NMR experiments that can be used to investigate protein–glycan interactions. There are many others that take advantage of additional properties such as differences in translational diffusion constants and specific interactions with water molecules. Many of these have been adopted as screening methods used in fragment based drug discovery programs. Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues.'
 ""Binding to molecules carrying one M6P (Figure 33.2, structure D) is intermediate in affinity. Removal of outer mannose residues by processing Golgi mannosidases enhances binding. Genes encoding both MPRs have been cloned and extensively characterized. Both are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with extracytoplasmic, transmembrane, and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The CI-MPR has 15 contiguous repetitive units of ∼145 amino acids with partial identity to one another. The CD-MPR has a single extracellular domain, showing homology with the repeating domains of the CI-MPR (Figure 33.4A). Together with conservation of certain intron–exon boundaries, this homology suggests that the two genes evolved from a common ancestor. On the basis of their sequence relationships and unique binding properties to M6P, the two MPRs have been formally classified as P-type lectins. Structural homologs of the MPRs are present in yeast and Drosophila, but these proteins lack M6P-binding ability. (A) Schematic diagram of cation-independent (CI-MPR) and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CD-MPR). (B) Ribbon diagram of the bovine CD-MPR. Shown are the two monomers (magenta and cyan ribbons) of the dimer as well as the ligand M6P (gold (more...) The CD-MPR exists mainly as a dimer, with each monomer binding one M6P residue. The CI-MPR also seems to be a dimer in the membrane, although it readily dissociates on solubilization. Two of its repeating units (3 and 9) bind M6P phosphomonoesters with high affinity, a third (5) binds M6P phosphodiesters, and a fourth (15) binds both M6P phosphomonoesters and diesters with equal affinity. Mutagenesis studies have identified the specific residues of these receptors involved in M6P binding, and crystal structures of several M6P-binding domains have been obtained in complex with M6P. Comparison of the binding pockets reveals four residues (Gln, Arg, Glu, Tyr) are positionally conserved and form the same contacts with the mannose ring. The CD-MPR has been crystallized as a dimer, with each monomer folded into a nine-stranded flattened β-barrel that has a striking resemblance to the protein folds in avidin (Figure 33.4B). The distance between the two ligand-binding sites of the dimer provides a good explanation for the differences in binding affinity shown by the CD-MPR toward various lysosomal enzymes. Crystal structures of recombinant forms of the CI-MPR have also been solved that encompass all but two of the 15 contiguous domains in its extracellular region (i.e., domains 1–5, domains 7–11, and domains 11–14). Each domain shows a topology similar to that of the CD-MPR. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the CI-MPR isolated from bovine liver has been carried out under conditions: (1) not conducive to ligand binding (pH 4.5), and (2) found at the cell surface (pH 7.4) and bound to the non-glycosylated ligand, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) via CI-MPR's domain 11. Although the cryo-EM structure at pH 7.4 is unable to visualize the N- (domains 1–3) and C- (domain 15) termini with sufficient resolution, it does provide insight into the arrangement of the entire extracellular region of the CI-MPR. The proposed cryo-EM model does not position the two M6P-binding domains (3 and 9) sufficiently close to bind a single, diphosphorylated N-glycan. This suggests that the high-affinity binding of this N-glycan is due to the spanning of binding sites located on different monomers of the CI-MPR. An alternative possibility is that the receptor is dynamic, with the spacing between the two M6P-binding sites being flexible, to enhance interactions with lysosomal enzymes containing phosphorylated glycans at various positions on their protein backbones. The dynamic nature of the receptor is supported by structural and biophysical studies which show that the conformation of the CI-MPR is affected by pH. The CI-MPR adopts a more compact structure under acidic conditions that may facilitate unloading of lysosomal enzymes in the acidic environment of endosomal compartments.""]","The significance of the β-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains lies in its ability to provide specificity and selectivity in glycan recognition. The unique arrangement of binding sites enables R-type lectins to distinguish between different glycan structures, allowing them to interact with specific ligands and perform their intended biological functions.","The β-trefoil fold in R-type lectin domains presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding a 40-residue subdomain. The ability of β-trefoil proteins to flexibly select a variety of carbohydrate partners is not surprising, given the conserved structures consisting of variable loops and a short β-barrel.",,,0.5880809991820135,0.8513579003131955,0.039735099337748346,0.32499999998375,,0.0,0.5833333333041666,,,

What are the general clinical features of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) involving defects in N-glycan biosynthesis?

This question can be fully answered by referencing the provided text, which describes the broad clinical features of CDGs with defective N-glycosylation, including involvement in multiple organ systems such as the central and peripheral nervous systems, hepatic, visual, and immune systems.","['Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?  As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems. When that intellectual singularity is eventually achieved, further editions of this book may no longer be necessary.'
 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Diagnostic fragment ions can sometimes be found confirming terminal epitopes such as a fucosylated Hex-HexNAc or sialylated fucosylated Hex-HexNAc (Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis x, respectively) but these cannot be distinguished from Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis a. Detailed glycan profiling achieved with site resolution (structure-focused glycoproteomics) is an important frontier that should be a goal of the next-generation of glycoproteomics. At this time, continued development of selective enrichment and/or preseparation of specific subsets of glycopeptides needs to be pursued, because no single LC-MSn method or instrument is sufficient to handle the full dynamic range of the entire glycopeptide pool derived from a complete glycoproteome. To limit the search space and enhance the detailed structural knowledge of the glycans encountered in a given glycoproteome, parallel profiling of the glycome can be performed. Such a “glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics” approach (Figure 51.2) can also be complemented with quantitative proteome and de-glycoproteome profiling (mapping of glycosylation sites), which reduce the search space even further and provide supporting evidence to pinpoint the mechanism(s) driving the observed glycoproteome alterations. Although glycoproteomics is rapidly maturing and continues to reach a larger group of scientists, significant analytical challenges remain and the technology is still best performed in “specialist” laboratories because of the demand for manual expert interrogation and interpretation of data. Current glycoproteomics methods cannot identify the full complement of glycans on every site of a mixture of glycoproteins and cannot easily tackle multiply glycosylated peptides especially with both N- and O-linked glycan structures. Defining the relative proportions of different intact glycoform populations is important for understanding biological function. This has only been achieved in a few cases (e.g., by MS analysis of the intact IgG glycoprotein). Several promising informatics initiatives aimed at automating the glycopeptide identification process, aiding the quantitation, and supporting the interpretation of the data output have appeared over recent years. A recent interlaboratory study conducted by the Human Glycoproteomics Initiative of HUPO highlights the importance of different software search parameters for the successful identification and characterization of glycopeptides in order to try to deal with false positives and the reporting of thousands of nonverified glycopeptides. At this stage, for most of the available glycopeptide identification software tools it is strongly advised that manual validation of the glycopeptide assignments still be performed to generate sufficient confidence in the reported identifications. It is therefore clear that the computational solutions require further improvements to advance the field of glycoproteomics and ultimately achieve full integration among other disciplines within the glycosciences (Chapter 52).

This chapter illustrates and discusses some key mechanisms by which glycans influence the pathogenesis and progression of bacterial and viral infections and describes examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Infectious diseases remain a major cause of death, disability, and social and economic disorder for millions of people throughout the world. Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host. Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors. A human in good health is colonized by as many as 1013 bacteria on the skin and mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, a number that resembles the number of cells in our own body. Despite all these direct and continuous encounters, it is relatively rare that bacteria invade into the tissues to produce serious infections. Although not restricted to pathogenic species/strains, one feature shared by many of these disease-causing agents is the presence of diverse polysaccharide capsule structures, which encapsulate bacteria (Chapter 21). These structures can have many biological properties, both stimulating and thwarting immune detection in different settings. Capsules make key contributions to the virulence of multiple bacterial pathogens, reducing recognition by the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, capsular polysaccharides are also commonly the natural targets of the adaptive immune system. In fact, antibodies specific to different capsule structures often define the serology used to differentiate subtypes of particular bacterial species. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) encodes perhaps the most historically significant capsule in biology and medicine. Pioneering experiments by Frederick Griffith in 1928 showed the in vivo transfer of virulence from a dead encapsulated (smooth) disease-causing strain to an avirulent, nonencapsulated (rough) strain. Studies regarding immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharides (Figure 42.1) provided the framework for the discoveries of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, which showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information. Classical experiments on the role of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule in virulence. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) strains can be identified with either a “rough” (R) or a “smooth” (S) phenotype, the latter being (more...) Killing of bacteria by phagocytes of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils or macrophages, is aided by opsonization, a process in which the bacterial surface is tagged with complement proteins or specific antibodies. Phagocytes express receptors for activated complement and antibody Fc domains, allowing them to bind, engulf, and kill bacteria. Together these processes are referred to as opsonophagocytosis. Genetic mutagenesis of capsule biosynthesis genes and infectious challenge in small animal models have illustrated the roles of bacterial capsules in resisting opsonophagocytosis. Compared with the wild-type parent bacterial strains, isogenic capsule-deficient mutants of group A Streptococcus (GAS), group B Streptococcus (GBS), pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), and several other important human pathogens are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by opsonophagocytosis and fail to establish systemic infection.'
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""
 'Adhesion may be mediated through terminal sugars or internal carbohydrate motifs. In other cases, the bacteria express adhesins that bind matrix glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, or laminin) or mucin, mediating attachment to the mucosal surface. The specific carbohydrate ligands for bacterial attachment on the animal cell are often referred to as adhesin receptors, and they are quite diverse in nature. The tropism of individual bacteria for particular host tissues (e.g., skin vs. respiratory tract vs. gastrointestinal tract) is determined by specific combinations of adhesin–receptor pairs. Pili or fimbriae are assemblies of protein subunits that project from the bacterial surface in hair-like threads whose tips often adhere to host glycans (Figure 42.3A). Such pili are usually composed of a repeating structural subunit providing extension and a different “tip adhesin” responsible for binding. The structural proteins for pilus assembly are often encoded in a bacterial operon. Lateral mobility of pili structures in the bacterial membrane provides a Velcro-like binding effect to epithelial surfaces. Certain strains of E. coli express pili that bind avidly to P-blood group–related glycosphingolipids in the bladder epithelium, leading to urinary tract infection. Pathogenic strains of Salmonella produce pili that facilitate adherence to human intestinal cell mucosa, thereby causing food poisoning and infectious diarrhea. In other cases, a surface-anchored protein (afimbrial adhesin) expressed by the bacteria represents a critical colonization factor (Figure 42.3B). For example, the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis promotes strong attachment of the bacteria to the ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchi and trachea, triggering local inflammation and tissue injury that results in the “whooping cough” disease. FHA is a component of modern pertussis vaccines given in infancy and early childhood to block infection. Examples of mechanisms of bacterial adherence to host cell surfaces. (A) Pili or fimbriae are organelles that project from the cell surface. They are made up of a repeating structural subunit and a protein at their tip that mediates recognition of a specific (more...) Adhesins can be glycoproteins as well. In Pasteurellaceae and some H. influenzae strains adhesins are N-glucosylated by a cytoplasmic N-glucosylation system that is homologous to the cytoplasmic O-GlcNAc transferase of eukaryotes. Similarly, transfer of heptose residues by the dodecameric bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family of enzymes to autotransporter adhesins in several different Gram-negative pathogens is essential for the adhesion process. Glycan–lectin interactions play pivotal roles in enabling certain pathogens to penetrate or invade through epithelial barriers, whereupon they may disseminate into and through the bloodstream to produce deep-seated infections. Samonella Typhi causes typhoid fever in humans, a process that begins with intracellular invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The outer core oligosaccharide structure of the LPS is required for internalization into epithelial cells. Removal of a key terminal sugar residue on the outer core markedly reduces the efficiency of bacterial uptake. Once invasion has occurred, the secreted A2B5 typhoid toxin mediates illness by first binding preferentially to the sialic acid Neu5Ac, which is enriched in humans. Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), the cause of strep throat, as well as serious invasive infections, attaches to human pharyngeal and skin epithelial cells via interaction of its hyaluronan capsular polysaccharide with the host hyaluronan-binding protein CD44 (Chapter 16). This binding induces marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane ruffling and opening of intercellular junctions that allow tissue penetration by GAS through a paracellular route. Bacterial glycosyltransferases are also involved in the intracellular manipulation of host responses. For example, injection of the NleB glycosyltransferase into host cells by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) results in the N-GlcNAc modification of arginine residues of host proteins, leading to the suppression of NF-κB-driven responses. Another bacterial glycosyltransferase with an intracellular target is the GlcNAc transferase toxin of Photorhabdus asymbiotica PaTox.'
 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.']","Glycan-lectin interactions.

 ""Furthermore, several polymorphisms within the promoter region of MBL2 are associated with MBL deficiency and enhanced susceptibility to infections. Genetic variants of MBL2 are also associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, polymorphisms in MASP1 and MASP2 are associated with altered serum levels and compromised activity of collectins. Activation of these proteases can also lead to prothrombin cleavage and promote clot formation. Myeloid cells, which include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs, have a large number of proteins with CTLDs, which belong mainly to groups 2, 5, and 6 (Figure 34.3). Myeloid cells also express many members of the galectin and Siglec families of lectins. All leukocytes express L-selectin (group 4), which is discussed below in a separate section on selectins. Group 2 CTLs are DC-SIGN (in humans, but there is no murine homolog), CD209a (also termed SIGN-R1 in mice, but there is no human homolog), macrophage CTL (MCL), dectin-2 (DC-associated C-type lectin-2), langerin, the macrophage galactose-binding lectin (MGL), DCIR and the macrophage inducible Ca++-dependent lectin (MINCLE) (CLEC4E); in group 5, Ca++-independent lectin dectin-1, LOX-1, CLEC12B, CLEC9A (DNGR-1), myeloid-DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1), CLEC-1, CLEC-2, and dendritic cell–associated lectin-1 (DCAL-1); and in group 6, Ca++-dependent macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) and DEC-205 (CD205). There are approximately 20 members of the natural killer (NK) cell receptor group 5 of CTLD-containing proteins in humans, and additional ones in mice. Many of the genes encoding the NK cell receptor group 5 are present on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 6. The dectin-1 cluster that is part of the NK gene complex of CTLDs (mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 12) includes dectin-1 (CLEC7A), CLEC-1 (CLEC1A), CLEC-2 (CLEC1B), LOX-1 (OLR), CLEC12b, and CLEC9A. These CTLD-containing receptors bind various ligands such as glycans, but also proteins, lipids, inorganic compounds, and even ice. The dectin-2 cluster of CTLDs (whose genes are clustered in the centromeric region of the NK gene cluster) and represent group 2 CTLs includes dectin-2 (CLEC6A), blood DC antigen 2 (BDCA-2) (CLEC4C), DC immunoactivating receptor (DCAR) Clec4b in mice, absent in humans), DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) (CLEC4A), CTL superfamily 8 (CLECSF8) (CLEC4D), and MINCLE (CLEC4E). Mice have the Ly49 family of receptors that contain CTLDs and are on murine chromosome 6. But the Ly49 members, also termed Ly49 NK cell receptors, may not bind sugar but primarily bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and MHC class I–like molecules expressed by viruses. These are most functionally related to the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in human NK cells and some T cells. Numerous myeloid proteins with CTLDs can recognize not only pathogen moieties for host defense, but also modified self-antigens such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dead cells. The glycan and nonglycan ligands for the myeloid CTLs are diverse. MINCLE can recognize characteristic PAMPs such as α-mannose-containing glycans and trehalose-6,6-dimycolate, a key glycolipid virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, and thus induce immune responses against infection. MINCLE also maintains self-homeostasis and monitors the internal environment by sensing damaged cells by recognizing SAP130, a component of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and the intracellular metabolite beta-glucosylceramide (β-GlcCer) both exposed by dying cells.""

Glycosylation is the process by which glycans are added to proteins or lipids, which can affect their function, localization, and interactions. Glycan antigens are specific carbohydrate structures on the surface of cells or pathogens that can trigger an immune response.

In the context of thrombosis, bleeding disorders, and hemolytic anemia, glycosylation and glycan antigens may influence the following:

1. **Thrombosis**: Glycans on platelets and blood vessels may regulate platelet adhesion and aggregation, influencing thrombus formation.
2. **Bleeding disorders**: Abnormal glycosylation patterns on clotting factors or platelets might disrupt hemostasis, leading to bleeding tendencies.
3. **Hemolytic anemia**: Glycan antigens on red blood cells could trigger an immune response, causing their destruction and resulting in anemia.

The provided excerpts highlight the significance of glycans in various biological processes, including glycan-mediated pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies, as well as the role of glycans in modulating the host-pathogen interaction. This information suggests that glycosylation and glycan antigens may indeed play a crucial role in the development of complications such as thrombosis, bleeding disorders, and hemolytic anemia.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Ramya and Gabriel Rabinovich.'
 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'
 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.42 Amanda L. Lewis, Christine M. Szymanski, Ronald L. Schnaar, and Markus Aebi. This chapter illustrates and discusses some key mechanisms by which glycans influence the pathogenesis and progression of bacterial and viral infections and describes examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Infectious diseases remain a major cause of death, disability, and social and economic disorder for millions of people throughout the world. Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host. Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors. A human in good health is colonized by as many as 1013 bacteria on the skin and mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, a number that resembles the number of cells in our own body. Despite all these direct and continuous encounters, it is relatively rare that bacteria invade into the tissues to produce serious infections. Although not restricted to pathogenic species/strains, one feature shared by many of these disease-causing agents is the presence of diverse polysaccharide capsule structures, which encapsulate bacteria (Chapter 21). These structures can have many biological properties, both stimulating and thwarting immune detection in different settings. Capsules make key contributions to the virulence of multiple bacterial pathogens, reducing recognition by the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, capsular polysaccharides are also commonly the natural targets of the adaptive immune system. In fact, antibodies specific to different capsule structures often define the serology used to differentiate subtypes of particular bacterial species. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) encodes perhaps the most historically significant capsule in biology and medicine. Pioneering experiments by Frederick Griffith in 1928 showed the in vivo transfer of virulence from a dead encapsulated (smooth) disease-causing strain to an avirulent, nonencapsulated (rough) strain. Studies regarding immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharides (Figure 42.1) provided the framework for the discoveries of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, which showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information. Classical experiments on the role of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule in virulence. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) strains can be identified with either a “rough” (R) or a “smooth” (S) phenotype, the latter being (more...) Killing of bacteria by phagocytes of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils or macrophages, is aided by opsonization, a process in which the bacterial surface is tagged with complement proteins or specific antibodies. Phagocytes express receptors for activated complement and antibody Fc domains, allowing them to bind, engulf, and kill bacteria. Together these processes are referred to as opsonophagocytosis. Genetic mutagenesis of capsule biosynthesis genes and infectious challenge in small animal models have illustrated the roles of bacterial capsules in resisting opsonophagocytosis. Compared with the wild-type parent bacterial strains, isogenic capsule-deficient mutants of group A Streptococcus (GAS), group B Streptococcus (GBS), pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), and several other important human pathogens are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by opsonophagocytosis and fail to establish systemic infection.'
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""
 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

""What enables lipid raft-mediated information flow from outside the cell?""

This rewritten question still conveys the same essence as the original, but it's more concise and requires the reader to make logical connections between the functions of lipid rafts and glycosphingolipids.","['Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Cristina De Castro and Christopher Mark West.'

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'
 'When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?  As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems.

Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution.

In vertebrates, sialic acids are found in various forms, including polySia (polysialic acid), which plays a crucial role in neural cell adhesion and migration. The text also mentions gangliosides, which are complex glycans with Sia residues, and their importance in brain development and function.

In contrast, invertebrates, such as some higher invertebrates, have different types of Sia variants. For example, the bacterial NulOs (nonulosonic acids) have various substitutions at the C-5 and C-7 positions, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), and other groups. These substitutions contribute to the diversity of Sia variants across invertebrates.

The conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates due to their distinct evolutionary histories and selective pressures. In vertebrates, the evolution of Sia-based glycan structures is influenced by factors such as brain development, neural cell adhesion, and immune response. In contrast, the evolution of Sia variants in invertebrates is shaped by different environmental pressures and interactions with their hosts.

In summary, while both vertebrates and some higher invertebrates have diverse Sia variants, their conservation patterns differ due to distinct evolutionary forces acting on each group.","Conservation patterns for Sia variants differ across vertebrates and some higher invertebrates in that Sias are prominent in the deuterostome lineage (comprising vertebrates and some “higher” invertebrates), with exceptions. For example, insects were believed to be free of Sias until their discovery in cicada Malpighian tubules and Drosophila brains, and later identification of a single Drosophila gene (SiaT) with sequence similarities to mammalian STs. When SiaT is inactivated, flies suffer locomotor abnormalities and defects in neuromuscular junctions. Although of very low abundance, Sias are both present and crucial to the survival of Drosophila.",0.26666666666666666,0.5026316473008094,0.420320494715252,0.6841589041633775,0.017857142857142856,0.8333333332916666,1.0,0.0,0.8333333332916666,1.0,1.0,1.0

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

 'Diagnostic fragment ions can sometimes be found confirming terminal epitopes such as a fucosylated Hex-HexNAc or sialylated fucosylated Hex-HexNAc (Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis x, respectively) but these cannot be distinguished from Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis a. Detailed glycan profiling achieved with site resolution (structure-focused glycoproteomics) is an important frontier that should be a goal of the next-generation of glycoproteomics. At this time, continued development of selective enrichment and/or preseparation of specific subsets of glycopeptides needs to be pursued, because no single LC-MSn method or instrument is sufficient to handle the full dynamic range of the entire glycopeptide pool derived from a complete glycoproteome. To limit the search space and enhance the detailed structural knowledge of the glycans encountered in a given glycoproteome, parallel profiling of the glycome can be performed. Such a “glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics” approach (Figure 51.2) can also be complemented with quantitative proteome and de-glycoproteome profiling (mapping of glycosylation sites), which reduce the search space even further and provide supporting evidence to pinpoint the mechanism(s) driving the observed glycoproteome alterations. Although glycoproteomics is rapidly maturing and continues to reach a larger group of scientists, significant analytical challenges remain and the technology is still best performed in “specialist” laboratories because of the demand for manual expert interrogation and interpretation of data. Current glycoproteomics methods cannot identify the full complement of glycans on every site of a mixture of glycoproteins and cannot easily tackle multiply glycosylated peptides especially with both N- and O-linked glycan structures. Defining the relative proportions of different intact glycoform populations is important for understanding biological function. This has only been achieved in a few cases (e.g., by MS analysis of the intact IgG glycoprotein). Several promising informatics initiatives aimed at automating the glycopeptide identification process, aiding the quantitation, and supporting the interpretation of the data output have appeared over recent years. A recent interlaboratory study conducted by the Human Glycoproteomics Initiative of HUPO highlights the importance of different software search parameters for the successful identification and characterization of glycopeptides in order to try to deal with false positives and the reporting of thousands of nonverified glycopeptides. At this stage, for most of the available glycopeptide identification software tools it is strongly advised that manual validation of the glycopeptide assignments still be performed to generate sufficient confidence in the reported identifications. It is therefore clear that the computational solutions require further improvements to advance the field of glycoproteomics and ultimately achieve full integration among other disciplines within the glycosciences (Chapter 52).

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

The context mentions that influenza hemagglutinin (HemAg) binds to sialic acids (Sias) on the surface of host cells, specifically α2-3-sialylated glycans. This binding event triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes, allowing the virus to enter the host cell.

The context also highlights the importance of glycan recognition in influenza virus attachment. It mentions that certain sialic acid-containing glycans can block the adherence of influenza viruses to respiratory epithelial cells, suggesting that these glycans play a crucial role in the initial attachment step.

Furthermore, the context references the concept of molecular mimicry, where pathogens exploit host glycans as targets for recognition and attachment. In this case, influenza viruses have evolved to recognize specific sialic acid-containing glycans on host cells, allowing them to attach and initiate infection.

Therefore, I would infer that the mechanism by which influenza viruses attach to host cells involves the recognition of specific sialic acid-containing glycans on the surface of host cells, followed by binding and fusion with the viral membrane.","Influenza viruses attach to host cells by binding to cell-surface sialic acid receptors through its surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
