0,3,"Complete the following paragraph: After more than three billion years of evolution, every free-living cell and every cell type within eukaryotic organisms remains covered with a dense and complex layer of glycans (Chapter 20). Even enveloped viruses that bud from infected cells carry with them the glycosylation patterns of the host. Additionally, most secreted molecules are glycosylated and extracellular matrices of multicellular organisms are rich in glycans and glycoconjugates. Matrices secreted by unicellular organisms when they congregate (e.g., bacterial biofilms [Chapter 21]) also contain glycans. Thus, evolution has repeatedly and consistently selected glycans as being the most diverse and flexible molecules to position at the interface between cells and the extracellular milieu.","['Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","Here's a potential completion of the paragraph:

In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function.",1.0,0.6978974264084422,0.4706241990178085,0.9004593293233941,0.0,0.9999999999666668,1.0,0.0,0.99999999998,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.28156004492801007,0.09569422209066888

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Host-derived glycosylation in enveloped viruses is typically extensive and the resulting “glycan shield” protects the virus from immune reactions against the underlying polypeptide.

With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'In some cases, these latter lectins are encoded by separate but very similar genes. More than 100 of the seed legume L-type lectins have been characterized and are the most extensively studied proteins of this class. It also should be noted that the L-type fold has been observed in noncarbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectin-like receptor kinases in plants that are important in development and stress responses. A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet. The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand. An exception to this case is found in two lectins (ConA and the closely related Dioclea grandiflora lectin) in which the glycine is replaced with an arginine. Both the glycine and arginine form hydrogen bonds with the ligand via their main-chain amides. Loop C contains an invariant asparagine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via its side chain, and an invariant hydrophobic amino acid. Besides these invariant amino acids, backbone atoms of the residues of loop D also contribute to monosaccharide recognition. (Top) Three-dimensional structure of a peanut agglutinin (PNA) monomer showing the four loops involved in sugar binding: loops A, B, C, and D. The bound sugar (lactose) is shown as a “ball-and-stick” model. Calcium and manganese ions are (more...) The legume L-type lectins are generally classified into groups based on their carbohydrate specificities as often identified by the ability of monosaccharides to inhibit their agglutinating activity. These differences in specificities are brought about by variability in the conformation and size of the D loop and to some extent by the C loop. Although the main specificity regions of the legume lectins are determined by the loops, there are sites other than these that contribute to lectin specificity. There are several additional modes of refining these specificities, such as interaction with water, posttranslational modifications, and state of oligomerization. Legume L-type lectins are oligomeric—mostly dimeric or tetrameric in nature—and adopt a variety of quaternary structures. The back β-sheet in the monomeric unit is involved in oligomerization. Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class. Interestingly, some legume lectins have a hydrophobic binding site that binds adenine and adenine-derived plant hormones with micromolar affinity; this is two to three orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for monosaccharides.'
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""
 'Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis. The groups of Stuart Kornfeld and Kurt von Figura then found, surprisingly, that some of the M6P moieties were “blocked” by α-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to the phosphate residue, creating a phosphodiester. Comparison of glycans with phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters predicted that the metabolic precursor of the M6P determinant was a phosphodiester and that phosphorylation was mediated not by an ATP-dependent kinase but by a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This was proven using a double-labeled donor and Golgi extracts: Another Golgi enzyme phosphodiester glycosidase was shown to remove the outer N-acetylglucosamine residue and “uncover” the M6P moiety. Pulse-chase studies confirmed the order of events, documenting that multiple glycans on a given lysosomal enzyme could acquire one or two phosphate residues and that removal of some mannose residues on the N-glycan by processing Golgi mannosidases was also required (Figure 33.2). In most cell types, the phosphate is eventually lost after exposure to acid phosphatases 5 and 2 (ACP5, ACP2) in lysosomes. The overall biochemical pathway is shown in Figure 33.2. Pathways for biosynthesis of N-glycans bearing the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. Following early N-glycan processing (Chapter 9), a single GlcNAc phosphodiester is added to the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes on one of three mannose (Man) (more...) The first two enzymes that mediate these reactions were then purified and characterized and the encoding genes cloned. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-P-T) is an α2β2γ2 complex encoded by two genes. The α- and β-subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene, whose 1256 amino acid type-III transmembrane product undergoes proteolysis in the Golgi by site-1-protease (S1P) to give rise to the two subunits, whereas the 305 amino acid γ-subunit is encoded by the GNPTG gene (Figure 33.3). The α/β subunits contain the catalytic function of the enzyme (Stealth domains) as well as elements (Notch1, Notch2, and DMAP [DNA-methylase-associated protein]) that mediate binding to protein determinants present on the lysosomal enzymes. The γ-subunit facilitates the phosphorylation of a subset of the lysosomal enzymes. It contains an M6P receptor homology (MRH) domain that is thought to bind oligomannosyl N-glycans on the lysosomal enzymes and present them to the catalytic site for phosphorylation, and a DMAP recognition domain. The second enzyme, α-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester glycosidase encoded by the NAGPA gene, is a complex of four identical 68-kDa subunits, arranged as two disulfide-linked homodimers. Unlike other Golgi enzymes, this is a type-I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with its amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi. GlcNAc-P-T is an α2β2γ2 hexamer encoded by two genes. The GNPTAB gene encodes a catalytically inactive type 3 transmembrane precursor that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage between Lys-928 and Asp-929 in the Golgi by site-1-protease (more...) The oligomannosyl N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes are identical to those of many other glycoproteins passing through the ER–Golgi pathway. Thus, specific recognition by GlcNAc-P-T is crucial to achieve selective trafficking. This recognition is not explained by any similarities in the primary polypeptide sequences of lysosomal enzymes.'
 ""Note the alignment of positively (more...) Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity. Because the adhesins and the receptors often cluster in the plane of the membrane, the resulting combinatorial avidity can be great. An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips. The most well-characterized bacterial lectins include the mannose-specific type-1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding F-17 fimbriae, which are produced by different strains of Escherichia coli. Fimbriated bacteria express 100 to 400 of these appendages, which typically have a diameter of 5–7 nm and can extend hundreds of nanometers in length (Figure 37.3) Thus, pili extend well beyond the bacterial glycocalyx comprised of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharides (see Chapter 21). Escherichia coli express hundreds of pili, as indicated by the fine filaments extending from the bacterium. (Reprinted, with permission of Elsevier, from Sharon N. 2006. Biochim Biophys Acta 1760: 527–537; courtesy of David L. Hasty, University (more...) Examination of a high-resolution, three-dimensional structure of FimH bound to mannose revealed that, although mannose exists as a mixture of α and β anomers in solution, only the former was found in the complex. Mannose binds FimH at a deep and negatively charged site of FimH (Figure 37.4). FimH has “catch-bond” properties, such that the binding strength of individual FimH adhesins is augmented by increasing the shear forces on surface-bound E. coli cells. This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells. Uroplakin Ia presents high levels of terminally exposed mannose residues that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers. The resulting bacterial aggregates are flushed out of the urinary tract. Mice lacking the gene encoding the Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein are considerably more susceptible to bladder colonization by type-1-fimbriated E. coli than normal mice.

FimH prefers to bind D-mannose in the (more...) Most bacteria (and possibly other microorganisms) have multiple adhesins with diverse carbohydrate specificities. Many of these have been described (examples in Table 37.2), wherein the specificity of lectin binding can help define the range of susceptible tissues in the host (i.e., the microbe's ecological niche). The columnar epithelium that lines the large intestine expresses receptors with Galα1–4Gal-Cer residues, whereas cells lining the small intestine do not. Thus, Bacterioides, Clostridium, E. coli, and Lactobacillus only colonize the large intestine under normal conditions. P-fimbriated E. coli and some toxins bind specifically to galabiose (Galα1–4Gal) and galabiose-containing oligosaccharides, most commonly as constituents of glycolipids. Binding can occur to either internal (i.e., when the disaccharide is capped by other sugars) or terminal nonreducing galabiose units. P-fimbriated E. coli adhere mainly to the upper part of the kidney, where galabiose is abundant. The fine specificity of bacterial surface lectins and their relationship to the animal tropism of the bacteria can be further illustrated by E. coli K99.""]","...by preventing aberrant glycosylation patterns that can trigger an immune response. This interaction may help maintain a stable pool of glycoproteins in the ER that can facilitate proper protein folding and maturation, thus preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can trigger an immune response.","The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies. Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter.

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

Evasion of the host immune response depends on “antigenic variation,” a highly evolved survival strategy that relies on structural variance of GPI-anchored glycoproteins (VSGs) on the trypanosome surface (Figure 43.2).","VSGs are dimeric proteins, consisting of two 55-kDa monomers that each carry N-linked oligomannose-type glycans, which make up a large component of the dense glycocalyx. As parasites multiply in the host bloodstream, the host mounts an immune response that is effective against only the population of trypanosomes expressing a particular VSG. Trypanosomes that have switched to an alternative VSG coat (encoded among 1000 distinct VSG genes) escape immunological destruction.",0.6666666666666666,0.5998418167573984,0.5075224039477212,0.9140518174437576,0.2758620689655168,0.699999999965,0.8333333333333333,0.0,0.94999999997625,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.4183540626510301,0.0429804025219477
5,14,"Complete the following paragraph: Given their high density and widespread location on vertebrate cells, Sias also exert many functions via electronegative charge, such as repulsion of cell–cell interactions, protein stabilization, ion binding, and ion transport. Early nomenclature of these molecules was tied to their discovery, being first isolated by Gunnar Blix from salivary mucins in 1936 and independently by Ernst Klenk from brain glycolipids in 1941. Blix named his substance “sialic acid” after the Greek word for saliva (σíαλoν), and Klenk named his “neuraminic acid” for neurons in the brain. By the time the relationship of these substances became evident, both names were already in use and have persisted.","['Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D. Esko, Victor Nizet, and the late Nathan Sharon and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek and Ajit Varki.'
 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Similar 9-carbon backbone 2-keto acid monosaccharides were later discovered in some bacterial lipopolysaccharides and initially called “bacterial sialic acids.” The resulting confusion was resolved by suggesting that the term “sialic acid” (Sia) be limited to its original use in describing neuraminic acid (Neu), Kdn, and their derivatives in deuterostomes and their pathogens, and that the term “nonulosonic acid” (NulO) be used to encompass the entire group of 9-carbon backbone non-2-ulosonic acids (Figure 15.1).",0.0,0.6319771734457981,0.3532972215693138,0.7254089512131702,0.25,0.999999999975,,0.1428571426530612,0.4499999999775,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8381484826014614,0.2866841400255849
