Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11).

A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Low-molecular-weight competitive inhibitors of some of these enzymes can act as “chaperones,” which stabilize the folded enzyme in the ER and effectively rescue the mutation and increase the steady state concentration of active enzyme in the lysosome.

Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules.

The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins.

Glycosidases are enzymes that play a crucial role in the breakdown of glycans. They catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages between carbohydrates, releasing individual monosaccharides or smaller oligosaccharides from larger glycans. This process is essential for various cellular functions, such as protein modification, cell signaling, and immune response.

In other words, glycosidases are responsible for cleaving the bonds that hold glycans together, allowing them to be further processed, modified, or degraded. Their actions can significantly impact the structure and function of glycans, which in turn affects various biological processes.

Glycans play a crucial role in cancer development and progression. Changes in glycosylation patterns can occur during tumorigenesis, leading to altered cellular behavior, immune evasion, and metastasis. Here are some ways glycans are implicated in cancer:

1. **Tumor cell-cell interaction**: Glycans on the surface of tumor cells can interact with those on adjacent cells, promoting adhesion, migration, and invasion.
2. **Immune evasion**: Cancer cells can modify their glycosylation patterns to evade immune recognition, making them less susceptible to immune attacks.
3. **Metastasis**: Altered glycan structures can facilitate the dissemination of cancer cells to distant sites by modifying cell-cell interactions and adhesion molecules.
4. **Angiogenesis**: Glycans on endothelial cells can regulate angiogenic processes, influencing blood vessel growth and tumor perfusion.
5. **Cancer stem cell maintenance**: Glycosylation patterns can influence the self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells, contributing to their ability to resist chemotherapy and radiation.

To better understand these glycan-mediated mechanisms in cancer, researchers use various analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry-based glycomics, to study the glycans associated with specific cancers. By deciphering the roles of glycans in cancer, scientists can develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting these glycan-mediated pathways.","Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression. Glycan changes in malignant cells take a variety of forms: loss of expression or excessive expression of certain glycans, increased expression of incomplete or truncated glycans, and, less commonly, the appearance of novel glycans. More specifically, studies have observed: altered branching and fucosylation of N-glycans, altered mucin expression and truncated O-glycans, altered sialic acid expression, increased selectin ligand expression, altered expression of blood groups, altered expression of glycosphingolipids, loss of GPI-anchor expression, along with several other changes in tumor cells.

The similarity in glycan repertoire between plants and animals is largely attributed to the conserved nature of glycan structure-function relationships. Despite their differences in physiology, both kingdoms share a common ancestor that existed billions of years ago. As a result, the underlying principles governing glycan biosynthesis and function have been conserved across evolutionary time scales.

One key aspect contributing to this conservation is the fundamental role glycans play in cellular processes, such as cell signaling, immune response, and protein folding. These universal biological functions require specific glycan structures, which are shared between plants and animals due to their conserved nature.

In addition, the biochemical pathways involved in glycan biosynthesis and modification have also been conserved across kingdoms. This means that similar enzymes and reaction mechanisms are used to generate glycans with similar structures and functions in both plant and animal cells.

While there may be some differences in glycan repertoire between plants and animals, these variations are largely driven by changes in gene expression, environmental pressures, or evolutionary adaptations rather than fundamental differences in the underlying biochemistry.","Plants and animals express very different repetoires of glycans, owing primarily to the preference of each for alpha and beta glycosidic linkages in their general metabolism.",0.4375,0.8634108865779665,0.3952201969576904,0.36363636363636365,0.0,0.0
