       "'es in cryo-EM provide many exciting opportunities to study protein–glycan interactions, which will also be discussed.The fundamental understanding of glycan–protein interactions, as enriched by experimental studies of all types, has now been encoded in powerful molecular simulation programs that provide a computational approach to generating three dimensional pictures of glycan–protein complexes. These are important because it is difficult to produce complex glycan ligands in the amounts and purity required for most experimental approaches. These methods, although still evolving toward increased confidence in outcomes, provide models for experimentally inaccessible systems that can be tested with a variety of nonstructural approaches. They can also be leveraged with sparse structural data that alone could not provide detailed structural information.X-ray crystallography is a very powerful method for obtaining details of protein–ligand interactions. It excels in terms of the size range of molecules that can be studied (from small compounds to large multiprotein complexes) and in efficiency of data collection when high-energy X-ray beams at synchrotron sources are used. One of the limitations is still the crystallization step. Crystals of protein–carbohydrate complexes can be obtained by co-crystallizing the two partners or by soaking the carbohydrate ligand into an existing protein crystal. Because the quality of the crystal defines the limit of the diffraction pattern, and therefore the resolution of the structure, flexible oligosaccharide ligands may create structural heterogeneity and therefore limit the quality of the crystal. High-quality crystals of lectins are generally obtained with glycan ligands ranging from mono- to trisaccharides; glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins or antibodies, which can bind much larger ligands, are more rarely crystallized in complex with carbohydrate ligands.Diffraction data are now typically collected at very low temperatures, to protect molecules from radiation damage on high-energy synchrotron beam lines. Because freezing may damage the crystals owing to ice formation, glycerol is often used as cryoprotectant. Glycerol, with its carbohydrate-like hydroxylated carbons, is therefore frequently observed in glycan-binding sites, providing information about the amino acids involved in binding but sometimes competing with the carbohydrate ligand. Often, collaborative efforts with synthetic carbohydrate chemists are necessary to design, for example, nonhydrolyzable carbohydrate derivatives to obtain substrate and product-bound enzyme structures. These efforts can be combined with incorporating heavy atoms into the ligands, which in turn allow localizing them based on specific scattering characteristics.Crystal structures of protein–carbohydrate complexes can be retrieved from different sources, including the PDB, but also from more specialized databases. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZY) database provides links to the PDB page for all crystal structures of glycosylhydrolases, glycosyltransferases, and their associated carbohydrate-binding modules. UniLectin3D is a database covering the three-dimensional features of lectins, and includes more than 2200 lectin three-dimensional structures, of which >60% are complexed with a carbohydrate ligand. The UniLectin3D classification of more than 500 distinct lectins results in 35 lectin domain folds, 109 classes, and 350 families sharing ∼20% and ∼70% sequence similarity, respectively. For each structure, links for coordinates, references, and taxonomy are provided, as well as glycan array data when available at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. Mining for structural data is therefore possible, and structures can be analyzed at different levels revealing not only atomic details of the binding sites but also protein folds and oligomeric states. Examples are given below that illustrate how convergent evolution has built robust systems for efficient recognition of glycans by lectins.The interactions between carbohydrates and amino acids include hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, ionic bonds, and a number of more specialized interactions. CH-π interactions, for example, are associated with the frequent occurrence of aromatic amino acids in carbohydrate-binding sites. Water molecules are often observed that bridge between carbohydrate hydroxyl groups and amino acids. Interestingly, a significant number of enzymes and lectins use divalent ions that directly coordinate to the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates and to side-chains of amino acids. Among the 350 different lectin families crystallized to date, more than 40 involve calcium ions in their binding sites. Most of them belong to the C-type lectin families (including selectins and DC-SIGN [dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin]), but other types of lectins from different origins are also found to have one calcium ion in their binding site (Figure 30.1). LecB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires the presence of two closely located calcium ions. Calcium ions contribute to the specificity of lectins by selecting for precise stereochemistries of hydroxyl groups; the two calcium ions of LecB, for example, only coordinate monosaccharides bearing the specific sequence of two equatorial and one axial hydroxyl group present in “fuco” and “manno” configurations. The ions also play a role in enhanced affinity through delocalization of charge as evaluated by quantum chemical calculations and through compensation for binding entropy losses by releasing strongly coordinated water molecules.Graphical representation of six different calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding sites found in crystal structures of lectins. (A) Human MBP-A complexed with mannoside (1KWU), (B) Pseudomonas aeruginosa LecA complexed with galactose (1OKO), (C) sea cucumber (more...)Lectin structures adopt a limited number of folds (Figure 30.2). Among them, there is a strong predominance of β-sheet-containing domains, such as β-sandwich, β-prism, β-trefoil, or β-propeller. The β-sandwich fold, which is an assembly of two β-sheets, characterizes a large family with different structures that vary in size and localization of binding sites. For example, fimbrial adhesins are very different from galectins in that they use a site near the edge of a sheet as opposed to the concave surface of a sheet. Some structural convergence is nevertheless observed. Intracellular animal lectins, which are involved in the quality control of glycoprotein synthesis, share the same protein fold with legume lectins.(A) Distribution of the lectins with structures available in the Unilectin3D database as a function of fold family. (B) Graphical representation of some convergent β-propeller folds for lectins. The polypeptide chains are represented as ribbons (more...)Convergence is also observed for the β-propeller fold, which is a circular arrangement of small β-sandwiches, called blades. Structures with five, six, or seven blades have been observed for lectins. With the exception of bacterial and fungal fucose-binding six-blade β-propellers, which are evolutionary related, these structures do not present sequence similarities. However, they share the same global shape allowing for the presentation of all binding sites on the same side of the “donut,” providing for very efficient multivalent binding to glycoconjugates on cell surfaces. This multivalent effect results in high avidity: PVL from the fungus Psathyrella velutina has an affinity of only 100 µm for GlcNAc at each binding site but an apparent avidity of 10 nm for GlcNAc presented on chips. This high avidity makes PVL an excellent tool for identifying tumor cells presenting truncated glycans with exposed GlcNAc.NMR can provide de novo high-resolution structures of proteins and glycan–protein complexes. It can also provide dynamic information when parts of bound glycans retain some of the mobility displayed in solution. However, NMR-based structure determination usually requires uniform isotopic labeling with magnetic nuclei such as 13C and 15N, to complement data from the highly abundant nucleus, 1H. Isotopic labeling can be accomplished when proteins can be expressed in bacterial hosts, but even then application is largely restricted to proteins of <20 kDa or of <40 kDa when perdeuteration can be used to improve resolution. The cost of uniform isotopic labeling often excludes application to many additional proteins of interest—in particular, glycoproteins—when expression in eukaryotic hosts proves essential. Hence, only a few complete structures of glycoproteins with native glycosylation have been produced by NMR methods. However, NMR has fewer restrictions when it builds on protein structures available from X-ray crystallography or computational modeling and capitalizes on its ability to focus on data involving actual glycan–protein interaction sites. We illustrate this potential in the following sections.The initial step on the route to produce a three-dimensional structure of a protein by NMR methods is usually the assignment of backbone resonances, including the proton and nitrogen resonances of all amide 1H-15N pairs. This step is quite robust and can be accomplished in much less time, and on much larger targets, than a complete structure determination. These assignments are based on a series of multidimensional experiments that correlate chemical shifts of a series of directly bonded, NMR-active nuclear pairs. Among these is the two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment, which correlates an amide 1H-15N pair through the appearance of a crosspeak at the chemical shifts of the amide proton and nitrogen of a particular protein residue. Once crosspeaks in this experiment are assigned, changes in chemical shift on addition of a glycan ligand can be used to identify a binding site. These changes often arise from small perturbations in residue geometry rather than a direct effect of the ligand on chemical shift, but the effects are usually sufficiently localized to identify the binding site. Figure 30.3 shows an example of changes occurring on the interaction of a hexamer of chondroitin sulfate (CS), sulfated at the O4 position of each GalNAc residue (Chapters 3 and 17). There are actually two types of perturbations observed: gradual changes in chemical shift as ligand is added (arrows in Figure 30.3A) and the disappearance of one peak while another appears (ellipses in Figure 30.3A). These correspond to fast exchange on and off a weak binding site and slow exchange on and off a strong binding site, respectively. Perturbed residues can be mapped onto an existing structure of the protein, as shown in Figure 30.3B for the strong binding site. As with many complexes involving a sulfated GAG, positively charged residues are involved; in this case histidine residues and a lysine residue are among those showing chemical shift changes. The advantage of these experiments is that a range of ligands can be examined, even those that may fail to produce well-ordered crystals for crystallographic analyses. A limitation is that the backbone resonances of the protein need to be assigned first.Chemical shift mapping of slow and fast exchange binding sites for a 4-sulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS) hexamer on the Link module of TSG6. (A) Crosspeaks from spectra with increasing amounts of hexamer are superimposed. Those from residues experiencing (more...)NMR also offers the potential for characterizing the geometry a ligand adopts on binding to a protein surface and the parts of the ligand that make contact with a protein. In both cases, the characterization stems from transfer of magnetization from one NMR active spin to another NMR active spin (usually protons) in a distance-dependent manner. In the case of bound ligand geometry, the experiment relies on a transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (trNOE). The basis is the same as for the NOE that is used in protein structure determination by NMR; however, as a large excess of ligand over protein is used (>10:1), only the ligand spectrum is observed. Measurements are usually made from crosspeaks in two-dimensional experiments similar to the HSQC experiment mentioned above, except that both dimensions are proton chemical shift, and crosspeaks have intensities dependent on the inverse sixth power of the distance between proton pairs (1/r6) rather than direct bonding. An average over both bound and free ligands is observed, but contributions are heavily weighted by those coming from the ligand in a complex because of scaling in proportion to molecular weight. This makes it possible to conduct trNOE experiments with a large excess of ligand and very little protein. Also, there is no requirement for isotopic labeling of either ligand or protein, and having a high-molecular-weight complex is an advantage. The geometry of the bound ligand is derived primarily from distances measured between protons that fall on opposite sides of a glycosidic bond. This distance then restrains glycosidic torsion angles accessible to structural models. Although there are many cases in which the bound geometry is similar to that of the dominant conformer found in solution, there are cases in which the geometry differs. Here, trNOE experiments offer unique insight that can guide synthesis of competitive inhibitors.Transfer of magnetization from protons on a protein to protons on a ligand in an intermolecular NOE-like fashion can also provide information on the parts of a ligand in contact with amino acids in a protein\\'s binding pocket (the ligand\\'s interaction surface or binding epitope). In some cases, NOEs between a ligand proton and a specific amino acid proton can be observed, but this requires work with near-equimolar concentrations of ligand and protein, as well as full resonance assignment for both the ligand and the protein. A far more widely applied experiment sacrifices knowledge about specific protons on the protein for an ability to work with very large unlabeled and unassigned proteins. This experiment is called a saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR experiment. In fact, STD NMR investigations have also been conducted on some very large and complex systems including receptors embedded in membrane fragments, whole cells, and viruses. The experiment, which can be conducted at ratios of ligand to protein approaching 100:1, involves selective perturbation (saturation) of the magnetization of a set of protein protons and relies on the fact that the magnetization transfer between protons in large proteins is so efficient that it makes little difference where the change in magnetization is initiated; it can be from saturation of a methyl proton having a resonance at one extreme of the spectrum (upfield) or an aromatic proton having a resonance at the other extreme (downfield). Ideally, the saturation effect diffuses all over the protein protons and eventually is transferred to ligand protons close to the protein surface, and the resonances of these protons are reduced in intensity in a way that inversely correlates with the distances of a proton from the protein surface. Data are collected as a difference between one-dimensional proton spectra with and without saturation in the extremes of the protein spectrum. The resulting difference spectrum is dominated by resonances from the ligand that have contact with the protein. Mapping the position of protons assigned to these resonances onto a ligand structure allows depiction of the ligand binding epitope.Figure 30.4 shows an example that probes the interaction between a complex N-glycan (Chapters 3 and 9) and an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody. These antibodies specifically interact with surface glycans of HIV and are effective in inhibiting binding of the virus to target cells. Hence, there has been significant interest in exactly which glycans are recognized. Antibodies are large glycosylated proteins that are not usually amenable to NMR investigation by isotope-dependent methods, but STD NMR methods are applicable. The example uses a sample 20 µm in protein (Fab fragment) and 2 mm in glycan. Normal (reference) and STD NMR spectra are superimposed to show the saturated ligand resonances, which include some that come specifically from the Neu5Ac residues (Sia) on the termini of the glycan branches.Binding epitope identification in a complex-type glycan bound to the HIV-1 neutralizing antibody PG16 using saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information. (Reproduced from Bewley CA, Shahzad-ul-Hussan S. 2013. Biopolymers (more...)STD NMR applications involving long-chain multiantenna N-glycans, such as the one described above, are often hampered by the near-chemical equivalence of sites and degeneracy of resonances from the various branches of antenna. In these cases, the covalent attachment of lanthanide binding tags to the reducing end of the glycan has proven useful. The resulting dispersion of glycan signals due to pseudo-contact shifts can allow unambiguous determination of binding epitopes (see Further Reading).Although the rapid dispersion of saturation throughout the protein in standard STD NMR experiments suppresses information about what protein residues are involved in binding, there are ways to retrieve some of this information. In multifrequency STD NMR spectra, as in the case of the differential-epitope-mapping method (DEEP-STD NMR), two STD NMR spectra are obtained using two very different saturating frequencies in spectral regions devoid of glycan signals—for example, one in the aromatic region of protein protons and the other in the aliphatic region. In each STD NMR spectrum, the ligand protons close to directly saturated protein protons (e.g., aromatic protons) show a little increase in STD intensity, in comparison to protons further away from the saturated protein protons. Analyzing and mapping those differences along the structure of the ligand (so-called differential epitope mapping) allows retrieval of information about which areas of the glycan interact with those different types of amino acids in the binding pocket. If the geometry of the pocket is known, this allows elucidation of the orientation or polarity of the glycan in the binding pocket.The above provides a glimpse of NMR experiments that can be used to investigate protein–glycan interactions. There are many others that take advantage of additional properties such as differences in translational diffusion constants and specific interactions with water molecules. Many of these have been adopted as screening methods used in fragment based drug discovery programs. Information about these is available in Further Reading.With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses.Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues.For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure.For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules.A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native fully glycosylated HIV-1 envelope trimer. Protein subunits are shown as gray surfaces and glycans are shown as ball and sticks (PDB entry 5FUU). Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...)We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years.Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation.Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50. When protein–glycan interactions are of interest, the situation becomes more complex with hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and electrostatic interactions between glycan and various amino acids becoming important. For very limited sets of atoms, it is possible to pursue an understanding of interactions using advanced quantum mechanical (QM) methods, but for larger systems other approaches based on semiempirical “force fields” are used, as in molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.Empirical “force fields” used in MM and MD modules of packages such as Amber, CHARMM, and GROMOS are typically represented in terms of bond, bond angle, torsion angle, van der Waals, and electrostatic contributions to a molecular energy. Parameters in functions representing each of these terms have been optimized to reproduce QM as well as a selection of thermodynamic and spectroscopic data. Initially, these force fields were developed for proteins alone, so they did not include contributions such as the anomeric and exo-anomeric effects found in glycans. Subsequently, force fields explicitly designed to represent the energetics of glycans have been developed for use with these packages (e.g., the GLYCAM force field that is widely used with Amber). There still are challenges in simulating molecular interactions with these packages, among them perfecting models for solvent and accurately representing electrostatic interactions. These issues are very important for glycans, which are rich in hydroxyl groups that act as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in their interactions with water. Some glycans (e.g., GAGs) are highly charged, having both carboxylate groups and sulfate groups that interact strongly with positively charged amino acids in proteins and with water. Although early simulations were performed with implicit solvent models based on dielectric behavior, recent improvements in computational capabilities have allowed use of explicit solvent models, such as TIP3P and TIP5P.MD, which uses the force fields directly in Newton\\'s second law of motion, simulates movement of all atoms in addition to generating an ensemble of conformations and orientations that can be reached over times accessible to simulation (nsec to msec depending on the size of the system and efficiency of the computational platform). One advantage of MD is that certain important motional properties, such as the time for diffusion through a channel or the time needed for a conformational transition, can be modeled. One must remember, however, that force fields are meant to represent molecules near energy minima of a conformational surface and may not accurately represent the height of larger barriers separating different conformational states and certainly cannot represent changes in bonding that occur in a chemical reaction.The actual characterization of how a ligand (a glycan in our case) interacts with a protein involves not just the conformational energetics of the free glycan, but also the conformational energetics of amino acid residues involved in the binding site and the energetics of the glycan–protein interaction. In some cases, there may be relatively little information on where the binding site on a protein is, so the characterization involves locating the best binding site, finding the best conformation for the ligand in the bound state, and finding the best conformations for the parts of the protein involved in binding. The whole process is referred to as “docking” a ligand onto a protein surface. Most docking programs (e.g., AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and Glide) are designed to make the initial search for a site very efficient. To do this, they break the process into stages beginning with a rigid-body docking step that is designed to identify the best docking site and best initial “poses” for the ligand. Force fields are often simplified or interaction energies precalculated on a grid to speed up the process. Rigid-body docking generally works well for many small drug-like molecules. Also, in many situations, there is a crystal structure of the protein with a native ligand in the binding site, mitigating the problem of finding the binding pocket and optimizing side-chain conformations. For glycans, the situation is more complicated; the ligands are often flexible and protein structures with a native glycan in a binding site are often lacking.In molecular docking, the objective is not to generate a single bound structure in the first stage but hundreds of “poses” that can be scored and ranked so that a subset can be selected for subsequent stages. Scoring functions are variable but usually include some sort of interaction energy as part of the score. Subsequent phases typically allow increased flexibility of side-chains and finally an MD refinement of poses, often in explicit water. Final scoring or ranking of poses by energy, even when performed with force fields used in MD programs, seldom leads to a single clear solution, and it has become common to filter poses with additional experimental information such as binding epitopes from STD NMR experiments or interactions with residues that have been identified as important in mutational studies.Some docking programs are emerging (e.g., HADDOCK) that make use of experimental data in earlier stages to guide the selection of initial poses as well as maintain known preferences for glycan conformations or specific ligand–protein contacts. Some of the contributions to understanding of glycan–protein interactions that have come from docking exercises, as well as more advanced applications that merge QM with MD, are described in more detail in the following sections.Heparan sulfate (HS) chains, synthesized initially as a repeating disaccharide of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and modified subsequently by sulfation and epimerization of some GlcA residues to iduronic acid (IdoA), are known to interact with a number of growth factors, receptors, and chemokines (Chapters 17 and 38). Despite the interest in the roles of these interactions in cell migration and differentiation, there are relatively few experimental structures depicting interactions with large HS fragments. The fact that suitable crystals are less apt to form in the presence of HS oligomers contributes to the lack of structures of complexes. Also, it is difficult to obtain homogeneous preparations of large oligomers, because of the variable sulfation patterns and variable conversion of GlcA to IdoA.Computational modeling offers an alternative route to structures for many of these complexes. Specific patterns of sulfation and IdoA substitution are generated with ease. Yet, there are some challenges related to the flexibility of the HS chains and the ionic character of interactions that dominate their energetics; glycosidic angles in HS chains are variable, and IdoA rings sample several conformations, including a chair, 1C4, and a skew-boat conformer, 2S0. Moreover, orientations of the sulfate groups are variable, as are the side-chains of the lysine and arginine residues with which they tend to interact. Enhanced docking methodology combined with MD simulations overcomes some of these challenges.Leukocyte common antigen-related protein (LAR) is a type IIa receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) important for signal transduction in biological processes, including axon growth and regeneration. Glycosaminoglycan chains, including HS, act as ligands that regulate LAR signal transduction. Knowing where HS binding sites are and what molecular interactions drive binding is an important step in the design of agents that could promote regeneration. Figure 30.6 shows a snapshot of an HS pentamer bound to LAR. The structure was generated using the docking program HADDOCK. It employed several types of NMR data (chemical shift perturbation, STDs, and trNOEs) to guide selection of an initial set of 20 docked structures. The top scoring structures were subjected to short (50-nsec) MD runs in explicit water using GLYCAM06 force-field parameters for the HS fragment. The snapshot is from a longer (1-µsec) run, now highlighted in a movie (see Online Appendix 38A).Docking of a heparan sulfate (HS) pentamer to the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, LAR (PDB entry 2YD5). (Docked structures as described in Gao N, et al. 2018. Biochemistry57: 2189−2199.) The interactions are typical of many GAG–protein interactions in that charged sulfates and carboxylates of the HS fragment interact with lysine and arginine residues of the protein binding site. These interactions are further stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with neighboring groups (e.g., with the glutamine residue in Figure 30.6). The interactions with arginine are particularly important and, in addition to electrostatic contributions, often include those from bidentate hydrogen bonds between N-H groups on the arginine side-chain terminus and oxygens of sulfate groups. An example can be seen in the lower right where arginine 77 of the protein interacts with the N-sulfate on the terminal GlcN of the HS fragment.A large number of enzymes are involved in the synthesis and degradation of glycans (more than 300 human enzymes). Their relative activities, combined with cellular location, are essential to the proper balance of these processes and any alteration, including genetic mutation, can lead to disease in humans. Pathogens also depend on similar processes, and understanding such mechanisms can facilitate the design of selective inhibitors of pathogen enzymes. This is another area in which molecular docking can play a role. Structural studies of glycan–protein complexes usually require a stable system—not one that would continually convert substrates to products. Molecular docking can provide useful depictions of these reactive systems.A good example involves the glycosyltranferase, ST6Gal1. This is the enzyme that adds a sialic acid (typically Neu5Ac) to the galactose terminated branches of N-glycans by transferring Neu5Ac from its nucleotide-sugar donor, CMP-Neu5Ac, to an acceptor terminated with a Galβ1-4GlcNAc moiety (Chapter 6). The production of crystal structures of ST6Gal1, from both human and rat, opened the possibility of modeling at least a pretransition complex with both donor and acceptor in place. For the study discussed here, the crystal structure of the rat enzyme that contained neither donor nor acceptor (4MPS) was used as a starting point. The CMP-Neu5Ac was modeled into the active site based on the inactive donor analog in the crystal structure of the CstII protein (1RO7), which has a <20% sequence identity overall, but a much higher identity in the part of the active site that contains the donor. An initial structure for the minimal acceptor, Galβ1-4GlcNAc, was generated using the GLYCAM WebTool, but glycosidic bonds and hydroxyl groups were allowed to rotate during docking. Docking used the program AutoDock Vina. As in the previous example, an additional MD step in explicit water was used to refine the top ranked docked structure containing protein, donor, and acceptor. Interaction energies were then generated by applying MM/GBSA routines from Amber12 to 100-nsec MD production runs.Although the positions of donor and amino acid residues near the donor were modeled to be quite similar to those seen in other transferases, the docking/MD procedure provides a unique view of a possible acceptor position and its interactions. Most of the interaction energy holding the acceptor in place comes from interactions with the galactose ring, which is well-positioned to allow nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the nucleotide-activated Neu5Ac. This energy results from hydrophobic stacking of Tyr-366 with the nonpolar face of the pyranose ring and a network of hydrogen bonds between Asp-271, Asn-230, His-367, and Gln-232 of the protein and O2, O3, O4, and O6 hydroxyl groups of Gal. The position of the GlcNAc is more variable but does contribute to binding energy. The position and interactions among protein, donor, and acceptor are depicted in Figure 30.7.Stereo view of interactions between the donor (CMP-Neu5Ac), acceptor (GlcNAcβ1-4Gal), and protein residues in the active site of ST6Gal1.

The principle methodologies discussed here are each evolving: crystallographic methods using new X-ray sources (e.g., X-ray lasers) are allowing the analysis of microcrystals at room temperature and femtosecond timescales, thereby eliminating temperature- and beam-induced artifacts. Cryo-EM single-particle methods are approaching resolutions previously confined to X-ray crystallography. Single-particle and tomography EM approaches are continuing to undergo rapid development in terms of EM infrastructure, sample preparation, and data acquisition. Several user-friendly pipeline data processing packages exist, making this technology attractive to an increasing scientific audience. Hyperpolarization methods are reducing the sensitivity limitations of NMR, and solid-state NMR methods are allowing application to amorphous materials, including fibrils, cell-wall structures, and membrane fragments. Advances in computational technology are enabling simulation of ever larger systems and timescales. At the same time, structural targets are shifting from detailed characterization of single proteins and protein–glycan complexes to large-scale assemblies that cooperate to elicit a functional response. This is a promising situation for improved understanding of glycan function in biological systems.The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Barbara Mulloy, Dillon Chen, and Sean Stowell.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.31Richard D. Cummings, Ronald L. Schnaar, and Yasuhiro Ozeki.The R-type lectin superfamily is characterized by a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) originally reported in a polypeptide of ricin, a plant toxin. Ricin was the first lectin discovered, and the R-type lectins are named after it. Through evolution, the R-type lectin domain has given rise to various protein forms, some containing this domain alone and others containing additional functional domains (e.g., enzyme or toxin). We will discuss the diversity of this superfamily in terms of molecular tinkering and “bricolage,” based on structure–function relationships.In 1888, Peter Hermann Stillmark at the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu, Estonia) reported that protein extracts from seeds of Ricinus communis (commonly called “castor oil plant”; seeds are called “castor beans”) contained a factor (which he termed “ricin”) capable of agglutinating erythrocytes. Ricin was already well known as a toxin, but its carbohydrate-binding specificity was not analyzed in detail until the mid-20th century, when it was classified as a lectin. Structural analysis of ricin, performed around a century after its discovery, showed that the CRD had a “β-trefoil” (three-leaved) fold with a common Q-x-W motif in each subdomain. This domain structure defines the R(icin)-type lectins, a superfamily also classified as carbohydrate-binding molecule (CBM) 13 (http://www.cazy.org/CBM13.html) in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (Chapter 6). These lectins are widely present in all three biological domains (and their viruses) as glycan-binding proteins, including enzymes and toxins (Figure 31.1).The R-type lectin superfamily. Different groups within the superfamily are characterized by the domain structures shown. Ricinus communis is native to Africa and India and has been used for millennia, by many cultural groups, for numerous medical and industrial purposes. Two lectins, originally termed RCA-I and RCA-II, can be purified from the seeds. RCA-I (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) is a hemagglutinin and a very weak toxin. RCA-II (∼60 kDa), better known as ricin, is an agglutinin and a very potent toxin. Ricin is easily extractable from castor beans and can kill humans at very small doses.RCA-II (ricin; Figure 31.2) is synthesized as a single prepropolypeptide of 576 amino acid (aa) residues containing a secretion signal peptide (residues 1–35), an A chain (residues 36–302), a 12-aa linker region (residues 303–314), and a B chain (residues 315–576). The A-chain toxin is an N-glycoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.22) that inactivates the 60S ribosome. The B-chain lectin domain binds to galactose (Gal) and β-galactosides. The amino-terminal signal sequence brings the propolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal is cleaved off, and the polypeptide is glycosylated. The A chain is linked to the B chain by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 294 and 318 (Cys4 in the free B chain), and four intrachain disulfide bonds are formed. After glycosylation, ricin is transported to protein storage bodies in castor beans, where the mature ricin protein is generated by removal of the linker peptide by an endopeptidase.Structure of ricin. (A) Ricinus communis (beans and plants). (B) Crystal structure of ricin (RCA-II); resolution 2.5 Å. (Rutenber E, et al. 1991. Proteins10: 240–250. Image from PDB entry 2AAI.) RCA-I (agglutinin) is a tetramer consisting of two noncovalently associated ricin-like heterodimers. Each heterodimer contains an A chain disulfide-linked to a Gal-binding B chain. The A-chain sequences of RCA-I and RCA-II differ in 18 residues and are 93% similar, whereas the B-chain sequences differ in 41 of 262 residues and are 84% similar. The subunits are all N-glycosylated and usually display oligomannose-type N-glycans. Several other lectins having high homology with ricin are also encoded by the R. communis genome; some of these are termed ricin-A, -B, -C, -D (ricin), and -E.The B chain of both RCA-I (agglutinin) and RCA-II (ricin) contains two CRDs in the polypeptide. RCA-I binds preferentially to terminal β-linked Gal, whereas RCA-II binds to either terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc. These lectins are often purified and separated by differential elution from Gal-based affinity resins; RCA-II is eluted with GalNAc, and RCA-I is then eluted with Gal. These lectins have very low binding affinities for monosaccharides (Kd in the range 10−3 to 10−4m), but very high affinities (10−7 to 10−8m) for cells, because of their multivalency and enhanced binding to multiple surface glycans having nonreducing terminal Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (type-2 LacNAc) sequences. Both lectins also bind strongly to glycans with GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-R (LacdiNAc), and weakly to the isomer Galβ1-3GlcNAc-R (type-1 LacNAc). Neither lectin binds appreciably to glycoconjugates having nonreducing terminal α-linked Gal residues.Ricin is highly toxic and the effects of ingestion are severe, with symptoms appearing after a 2- to 24-h latent period. The lethal dose (LD50) of ricin is extremely low (3–5 µg/kg body weight). Ricin is classified as a type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP-II). RCA-I (agglutinin) is less toxic than ricin, because of the weaker enzymatic activity of its A-chain. Type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP-I), which lack a B chain with R-type lectin domains, are much less toxic than ricin because toxin entry into target cells is facilitated by B-chain carbohydrate-binding activity. RIP-I expressed in tissues of various types of plants affects disease resistance. Horizontal transmission of RIP-I gene to the genome of whitefly (Hemiptera, Insecta) feeding on such plants was recently demonstrated.Ricin bound to a β-linked cell-surface Gal/GalNAc containing glycans is transported into endosomes (Figure 31.3), and then migrates by retrograde trafficking to ER via the trans-Golgi network and Golgi apparatus. In the ER, A and B chains separate following reduction of the disulfide bond, perhaps catalyzed by the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase. A portion of the free A chain, which may be partially denatured in the ER, escapes by retrotranslocation through the Sec61 translocon and enters the cytoplasm.Pathway of ricin uptake by cells and mechanism whereby toxic activity of A chain in cytoplasm results in cell death. Just a few molecules of ricin A-chain in the cytoplasm are sufficient to kill cells. The catalytic subunit of A-chain is an rRNA N-glycosylase having eight α-helices and eight β-strands, which cleaves one purine base (adenine 4324) in the exposed GAGA tetraloop of the 28S RNA of the eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunit. This deletion results in loss of binding of elongation factor-2, inability of ribosomes to perform protein synthesis, and consequent cell death.Sequence analysis of RCA-I and RCA-II revealed that their B-chains contain two similar, characteristic regions in the polypeptide (i.e., the tandem-repeat R-type lectin). Each of the domains is approximately 120 aa long, with three tandem repeats of a 40-residue subdomain. Each subdomain contains a Q-x-W motif (x represents any aa). This tandem repeat is present in other toxins from plants of various phyla and is evidently characteristic of plant lectins. In the late 1990s, similar sequences were discovered in lectins from nonplant organisms, indicating that the ricin-B-like pattern is universal. In the early 2000s, these lectins were classified as the “R-type lectin superfamily,” and this superfamily is now categorized as a single domain (Pfam: PF14200) or tandem-repeat domain (Pfam: PF00652).Crystal structure analysis of ricin (Figure 31.2) indicated that B-chain (PDB 2AAI) has a barbell-like shape with the two tandem R-type CRDs at the ends, ∼35 Å apart. R-type lectins have a fold termed “β-trefoil fold” (from the Latin “trifolium” meaning “three-leaved,” as seen for example in clover) (Figure 31.4). The β-trefoil fold presumably arose through triplication of an ancestral gene encoding the 40-residue subdomain. The three subdomains, termed α, β, and γ, each consist of 12 β-strands and loops arranged around a central axis, giving the protein internal pseudorotation symmetry. β-trefoil fold is maintained by the characteristic Q-x-W motif in each subdomain of ricin B-chain and common R-type lectins. More than 10% of lectins use this fold for glycan recognition (Chapter 30).Structures of β-trefoil folds of R-type lectin domains in various proteins. (Top) Structures derived from bacteria, fungi, and slime molds: AH (actinohivin in actinobacteria; PDB 4DEN), CNL (nematocidal lectin from conifer-loving mushroom Clitocybe (more...)In view of the conserved structures consisting of variable loops and a short β-barrel, in combination with low sequence homology based on β-strands connected by loops, the ability of β-trefoil proteins to flexibly select a variety of carbohydrate partners is not surprising. β-Trefoil proteins have been divided into several groups on the basis of biological function; these include lectins, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (PDB 2AXM; Chapter 38), interleukin-1 (PDB 1ILT), Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (PDB 4IHZ), and the actin cross-linking protein hisactophilin (PDB 1HCE), although they have no Q-x-W motif.Each subdomain could conceivably have a carbohydrate-binding site; however, in most R-type lectins only one or two subdomains bind a carbohydrate ligand. Carbohydrate-binding of RCA-I and RCA-II arises from aromatic amino acids stacking against Gal/GalNAc residues and from hydrogen bonding between aa\\'s and hydroxyl groups of carbohydrate ligands.A wide variety of R-type lectins with diverse configurations, including RIP-IIs and heterotetramers such as RCA-II, have been purified from various plant tissues. Nontoxic lectins isolated from elderberry (genus Sambucus) bark include SSA (Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin) and SNA (Sambucus nigra agglutinin UniProt Q41358). These are useful because it is the rare R-type lectin that binds strongly to α2-6-linked sialic acid–modified glycans, but not to α2-3-linked sialylated ligands. Both are heterotetramers (∼140 kDa) composed of two heterodimers, each containing an A chain (resembling ricin A chain) disulfide-bonded to a B chain (R-type lectin).Expression of R-type lectins in roots and shoots of rice (Oryza sativa) was shown to be up-regulated in response to changing environmental conditions, based on genome informatics of Man and Gal-binding β-trefoil fold group EUL (UniProt B3SV73) found in Euonymus europaeus. Analysis of the promoter region of rice EUL genes revealed diverse stress-responsive elements. Analysis of expression profiles revealed that the genes were regulated in response to various types of stress (drought, osmotic, hormonal). Thus, β-trefoil fold lectins are involved in plant stress signaling and defense.Molecular structures of plant proteins having R-type lectin or β-trefoil fold domains vary extensively. Amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus) is an ancient South American crop plant with high nutritional value. Amaranthin (PDB 1JLX), purified from amaranth seeds, is a homodimeric lectin (Mr 66,000) consisting of two identical tandem-repeat β-trefoil fold domains. The primary structure of the lectin is ∼20% similar to that of ricin B-chain. Amaranthin specifically recognizes Thomsen–Fredenreich (TF or T antigen) (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) and sialyl-T (Siaα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) antigens. A GalNAc residue of the T-antigen disaccharide is captured by β- and γ-subdomains; thus, the mechanism of oligosaccharide binding by amaranthin differs from that of ricin B-chain and FGF (PDB 2AXM), in which a disaccharide is captured by a single subdomain.Phylogenetic survey of plant genomes revealed that many families have amaranthin-like R-type lectin domain sequences in their polypeptides. The sequences consist either of solely lectin domains (prototype R-type lectin), and include tandem repeats, or of a combination of lectin with various functional domains (chimera-type R-type lectin). Plants use R-type lectin domain by combining it with functional domains such as “aerolysin,” a pore-forming bacterial toxin. Tandem-repeat and chimera-type genes containing an amaranthin-like R-type lectin domain are expressed in many tissues and at different developmental stages, suggesting that R-type lectins respond to various external environmental stimuli.R-type lectins are present in fungi, protists, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Almost all of them have the same Q-x-W sequence and bind to Gal, GalNAc, and Man. Some are dimeric or oligomeric forms of simple β-trefoil subunits (prototype R-type lectin); others are tandem-repeat R-type lectins having two CRDs in the polypeptide chain. Chimeric forms have functional domains (enzymes, toxins) associated with R-type lectin, similar to those in plants and bacteria.Diverse forms of R-type lectins have been found in fungi (Chapter 23). Some consist solely of β-trefoil subunits. A dimeric prototype R-type lectin CNL (PDB 3NBE), from the conifer-loving mushroom C. nebularis, exerts nematocidal activity by binding to GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc glycan expressed in nematodes. CNL and another prototype R-type lectin, BEL (PDB 4I4X), from Boletus edulis, which binds to T-antigen, inhibit growth of cultured mammalian tumor cells.Chimeric forms in fungi include R-type lectin domains connected to tyrosinase-domain (PPO3: PDB 2Y9W), peptide N-glycanase-like-domain (MOA: PDB 2IHO), and aerolysin-like domain (LSL: PDB 1W3A). LSL from Laetiporus sulphureus (a bracket fungus) has a β-trefoil fold but not a Q-x-W motif.Studies of R-type lectins in protists are at an early stage. One was recently found in the anaerobic parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Chapter 43), a Gal/GalNAc-binding prototype R-type lectin (PDB 6IFB) consisting of two β-trefoil subunits. In each subunit, the α- and β-subdomain functioned, respectively, to capture carbohydrates and subunits connected by a disulfide bond.Prototype and tandem-repeat R-type lectins consisting solely of β-trefoil domains have been identified in various invertebrate groups, including sponges (phylum Porifera), earthworms (Annelida) (EW29: PDB 2ZQN), bivalves (Mollusca) (UniProt A0A646QVV9), and brachiopods (Brachiopoda) (UniProt A0A646QV64). SeviL (PDB 6LF2), in mussels, binds to the trisaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Gal, a component of gangliosides GM1b (Siaα2-3 Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1Cer) and GA1 (Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1Cer). GM1b is a target antigen of Guillain-Barré syndrome (Chapter 11), which arises from Campylobacter infection because structures of some bacterial lipopolysaccharides mimic those of the ganglioside (Chapter 20). Interaction between prototype R-type lectin and ganglioside-induced cytotoxicity against mammalian neoplastic cells through activation of MAP kinases. Another family of mussel lectins (MytiLec: PDB 3WMV; CGL: PDB 5F90) has a β-trefoil fold but not Q-x-W motif. Similar to Shiga toxins (Chapter 37), these lectins captured three Gb3 (Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc) glycans in three carbohydrate-binding pockets within the β-trefoil fold, and thereby induced signal transduction.Chimera-type R-type lectins connect with various functional domains in invertebrates. Pierisin in cabbage butterfly (Arthropoda, order Lepidoptera) larvae expresses R-type lectin domain at the carboxyl terminus of an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (Uniprot Q9U8Q4) and induces apoptosis of cancer cells. This lectin domain was found to bind to glycan ligands of Gb3 and Gb4 (GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc) glycosphingolipids on cancer cells termed, respectively, Pk and P antigens (Chapter 14). Clotting factor G α-subunit (Uniprot Q27082) in horseshoe crab (Arthropoda, order Crustacea) blood contained two glycoside-hydrolase domains on either side of a central R-type lectin domain. Another R-type lectin, CEL-III (PDB 2Z48), in sea cucumber (Echinodermata, Deuterostomia; Chapter 27) has both a pore-forming domain and a tandem-repeat-type R-type lectin domain and displays hemolytic effect on mammalian erythrocytes.Almost all the configurations seen in invertebrate R-type lectins are also found in bacterial R-type lectins. β-trefoil fold is a very effective protein scaffold for biological functions. Living systems have evidently improved their survival strategies by evolutionary tinkering of the R-type lectin domain per se, or by linking it with other functional domains.UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs: EC 2.4.1.41) have chimeric-form R-type lectin structures consisting of a catalytic subdomain (amino-terminal) and an R-type lectin domain (carboxy-terminal) (PDB 1HXB). Mucin-type O-glycans have a common core structure GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (Figure 31.5), which can be modified by addition of Gal or GalNAc residues (Chapter 10). Most proteins (∼80%) that pass through the secretory apparatus have at least one Ser or Thr residue modified with α-linked GalNAc. A family of ppGalNAcTs functioning in the Golgi are responsible for modification of Ser/Thr residues.Structure and function of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs). (A) ppGalNAcT activity with Ser/Thr-containing acceptor peptide and UDP-GalNAc as donor. Some ppGalNAcTs act preferentially on the product of this (more...)These enzymes are widely distributed in vertebrates, invertebrates, and protists, but so far have not been found in bacteria, plants, or fungi (Chapter 26). In humans, 20 ppGalNAcT-encoding isoform genes have been studied with regard to structure, substrate specificity, and function (Chapter 6). A ppGalNAcT (Uniprot S5S833) was found in a snail that serves as an intermediate host for trematodes, the primary group of schistosomes that infect humans. The snail ppGalNAcT, in contrast to those in vertebrates, has affinity for a wide range of substrates and only one isoform.Enzymes in this family of ppGalNAcTs have multidomain structure and are type II transmembrane proteins having the amino terminus in cytosol and carboxyl terminus on the other side of the membrane. They interact dynamically with their polypeptide substrates. In ppGalNAcT2, the R-type lectin domain interacts primarily with GalNAc on modified residues, whereas other regions of the polypeptide substrate lie in a groove next to the active site of the catalytic domain. The proximity of these two interactions positions the enzyme to bind special acceptor peptides. The parasitic protist Toxoplasma gondii (SAR supergroup, phylum Alveolata; Chapter 20) uses this enzyme to glycosylate cyst walls in the central nervous system to confer structural rigidity, thereby enabling the parasite to survive for the host\\'s lifetime.The diversity of R-type lectin domains in vertebrates is not well-understood, relative to those in plants or invertebrates. Mannose receptors (MRs) are type I transmembrane glycoproteins and unique multifunctional chimera-form lectins consisting of an amino-terminal cysteine-rich R-type lectin domain (PDB 1DQO), a single fibronectin type II domain, and multiple C-type lectin domains (CTLDs) (Chapter 34). MR CD206 (Uniprot Q9UBG0) is expressed on hepatic endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, other epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and functions in innate and adaptive immune systems. The domain configurations of phospholipase A2 receptor, DEC-205, and Endo180 are the same as that of CD206 (Figure 31.1), although their ligands are not glycans.When CD206 dimerizes on cell membrane, the R-type lectin domain binds to sulfated glycans. Pituitary hormones are captured by binding of this domain to 4-SO4-GalNAcβ1-R residues, 3-O-sulfated Gal, 3-O-sulfated Lex, or 3-O-sulfated Lea for clearance from the bloodstream. CTLDs recognize surface mannose-rich glycoconjugates on Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Leishmania donovani (Chapter 43). CD206 is considered a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that functions in clathrin-dependent endocytosis and in phagocytosis of nonopsonized microbes. MRs also play roles in adaptive immunity through their ability to deliver antigens to major histocompatibility class II compartments. Their R-type lectin domains facilitate binding to dendritic cells that express sulfated glycan-containing ligands such as sialoadhesin and CD45.Most of the known R-type lectin domains are found in bacterial lectins, enzymes, and toxins. Genes encoding R-type lectins have been observed in Archaea and viruses, evidently reflecting evolution from bacteria to eukaryotes. Microbial genes of the original R-type lectins may have been transmitted to eukaryotes; alternatively, lectins may have arisen through convergent evolution in the two groups.Actinohivin (AH; PDB 4DEN), a prototype R-type lectin in bacteria, consists of 114-aa polypeptides isolated from actinobacteria (genus Actinomyces). It binds to high mannose-type oligosaccharides, commonly found on the viral envelope GP120 of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). AH displays strong anti-HIV activity against clinically isolated viral strains (Chapter 42).R-type lectin domains are found in many bacterial enzymes and toxins. An example in Streptomyces is the enzyme endo-β1-4-xylanase (Xyn10A: EC 3.2.1.8; PDB 1ISX). Xyn10A acts as a glycoside hydrolase to catalyze cleavage of β1-4 xylose and can bind to xylan and a variety of soluble sugars, including Gal, lactose, and xylo- and arabino-oligosaccharides.Pore-forming domains are found in exotoxins produced by pathogenic bacteria that hemolyze erythrocytes. A monomeric lysin domain comprised of β-sheets oligomerizes like a piece of fabric tube to create pores on the cell wall. Aerolysin (Chapter 12) and hemolysin are bacterial toxins having R-type lectin domains. Many eukaryotes (plants, fungi, invertebrates) have aerolysin-like domains. Hemolysin (UniProt P09545) of Vibrio cholerae has a β-prism domain with jacalin (jackfruit lectin) structure, as well as R-type lectin domain.Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) from Clostridium botulinum has extremely high toxicity (LD50: 0.001 µg/kg) (Chapter 37). A component of BoNT termed hemagglutinin HA1 (PDB 3AH2) is a tandem-repeat-type dimeric R-type lectin subunit that binds to Gal at the carboxy-terminal subdomain. HA2, a subunit with β-trefoil fold, connects to the amino-terminal subdomains of two HA1s and to the jelly-roll-like β-sandwich fold subunit HA3 (PDB 2ZOE) (Chapter 32). HA1 helps orient BoNT to target intestinal cells by binding to Gal or Sia in gangliosides (e.g., GT1b) (Chapter 11) or cell-surface glycans.MTX (UniProt Q03988), a mosquitocidal toxin found in Bacillus sphaericus, contains an ADP-ribosyltransferase domain and four R-type lectin domains, arranged in a structural configuration similar to that of pierisin in cabbage butterfly larvae. Subunit forms of MTX are the same as those of cholera toxin and ricin (i.e., they consist of A-subunit [toxic enzyme] and B-subunit [lectin]).R-type β-trefoil lectins have been identified in numerous species in the families Halobacteriaceae and Natrialbaceae (class Haloarchaea), whose cell walls have mucin-containing glycoproteins (Chapter 22). Based on successful experimental culture of an archaeal strain, a model was proposed in 2020 for eukaryogenesis from Archaea. An intriguing possibility is that domain Archaea is the link for R-type lectins between domains Bacteria and Eukarya.Type-C and type-D BoNTs have been produced from the genome of a Clostridium bacteriophage. Were R-type lectin genes somehow produced by viruses? Metagenomic analyses indicate the presence of R-type lectin genes (Uniprot Q5UPX2) in the viral family Mimiviridae (Chapters 8 and 20), and phylum Nucleocytoviricota. Recent surveys reveal that the genus Mimivirus is distributed worldwide in oceans as well as on land. Extensive future studies of comparative expression levels of viral R-type lectin genes will help clarify relationships between glycan-codes and specific environments in the world\\'s ecosystems.The term “bricolage” refers to creation of novel tools in primitive societies in which availability of materials was limited. Creation of such tools may be based on tinkering with frameworks comprising limited sets of products and techniques used previously for other purposes. Analogously, modification and/or combination of genes in different groups of organisms may generate molecules useful for novel environmental responses. The β-trefoil fold structure, characteristic of the R-type lectin superfamily, is evidently a core framework in living systems that arose via bricolage and has evolved to play key roles in a variety of biochemical processes, including carbohydrate binding.Discovery of new R-type lectins is ongoing. The ancestor of this superfamily is not yet clear, but it is found in members of all biological domains. The origins and evolution of these lectins are therefore of interest to scientists in many fields. The presence of β-trefoil folding in proteins may reflect either convergent or divergent evolution. Elucidating the physiological functions of various R-type lectins will require identification of their endogenous ligands and the specific environmental stimuli that trigger their expression. Increasing knowledge of R-type lectin structure and function will enhance our understanding of lectin-glycan interactions in living systems and facilitate biotechnological applications of these lectins.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Marilynn E.

Rabinovich, and Avadhesha Surolia.The L-type lectins occur in the seeds of leguminous plants. They have structural motifs present in a variety of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) from other eukaryotic organisms. The structures of many of these lectins have been characterized, and many L-type lectins are used in a wide range of biomedical and analytical procedures and implicated in biomedical processes. This chapter discusses the structure–function relationships of these lectins and the various biological roles they have in different organisms.The L-type lectins have a rich history going back to the end of the 19th century when it was found that extracts from the seeds of leguminous plants (Fabaceae family but also called the Leguminosae family) could agglutinate red blood cells. These agglutinins (later named lectins) were found to be soluble proteins abundant in the seeds of leguminous plants. Different species of legumes were found to differ in hemagglutination specificity. Much work on these proteins was performed in the early part of the 20th century, including the crystallization of concanavalin A (ConA; the hemagglutinin [HA] from jack beans), which was first isolated by James Sumner in 1919 and crystallized in 1936 and was the first commercially available lectin. The legume lectins were also found to have hemagglutinating properties because of their ability to bind glycans on the cell surface.The abundance of these proteins in the soluble extracts of legume seeds (up to ∼5%–10% total protein) enabled many lectins to be isolated and characterized. Such seed lectins have considerable amino acid sequence homology, and the variety of carbohydrate-binding specificities found among these lectins made them useful tools in a wide variety of analytical and biomedical procedures.The crystal structures of a number of legume seed lectins allowed the identification of the carbohydrate-binding sites. Structural similarities in the tertiary structures were identified among these lectins and several other lectins, including the galectins (see Chapter 36), as will be discussed in this chapter. For this reason, the term “L-type lectins” has recently been designated as a classification for all proteins with this legume seed lectin-like protein structure.The L-type lectins are distinguished from other lectins primarily based on tertiary structure and not the primary structure. In general, either the entire lectin monomer or the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of the more complex lectins is composed of antiparallel β-sheets connected by short loops and β-bends, and they usually lack any α-helices. These sheets form a dome-like structure related to the “jelly-roll fold,” which is often called a “lectin fold.” The carbohydrate-binding site is generally localized toward the apex of this dome. The tertiary structure of the monomer of ConA, the lectin from the seeds of the legume Canavalia ensiformis, is shown in Figure 32.1. The crystal structures of at least 20 other legume L-type lectin monomers have been determined by high-resolution X-ray crystallography and are almost superimposable on this structure. Thus, it is not surprising that the amino acid sequences of legume lectins show remarkable homology with one another and of the sequences of many other legume seed lectins sequenced but not yet crystallized. Fewer, but significant, homologies in primary structure have been found between legume L-type lectins compared with some L-type lectins from far distant sources, such as ERGIC-53 and VIP36, found in vertebrates. Yet, in other L-type lectins, no homology is found with the seed lectins, although they contain similar lectin folds. For example, a comparison of the tertiary structure of the legume soybean lectin with the structure of human galectin-3 shows that both proteins contain the typical L-type lectin fold, but no amino acid sequence homology exists between the two lectins (Figure 32.2).Structure of concanavalin A (ConA), a legume seed lectin in complex with a branched pentasaccharide GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-3(GlcNAcαβ1-2Manα1-6)Man to 2.7 Å.

Both lectins display a related β-barrel (more...)Relationships between sequences of L-type lectins from legumes compared with the phylogeny of the various species within the Fabaceae family of plants suggest that these lectins most probably arose from divergent evolution. It remains an open possibility that the tertiary structures of some of the other members of the “L-type lectin family” arose by convergent evolution. It must also be noted that for a protein to be firmly placed in the L-type lectin category it must have the lectin fold and glycan-binding activity.All soluble L-type lectins found to date are multimeric proteins, although all do not have the same quaternary structure. Thus, these lectins are multivalent with more than one glycan-binding site per lectin molecule. The same multivalent principle applies to the membrane bound L-type lectins because the presence of two or more molecules on a membrane surface essentially presents a multivalent situation. In addition to increasing the avidity of the lectins for branched and/or cell-surface glycans, this multivalence can have great biological significance. Binding of the lectins to the cell surface can lead to aggregation of specific glycan receptors, promoting a variety of biological responses such as mitogenesis and various signal transduction processes.Plant L-type lectins are primarily found in the seeds of leguminous plants and are synthesized during seed development several weeks after flowering; they are transported to the vacuole where they become condensed into specialized vesicles called protein bodies. They are stable during desiccation of the seeds and can remain in that state indefinitely until the seeds germinate. They represent one of several classes of proteins stored in high concentrations in the seeds and are often called storage proteins. During seed germination, the storage bodies become the vacuoles of the cotyledons, which appear as the first leafy appendages of the plant. During the first week of development, these cotyledons provide food for the plant and eventually shrivel up and disappear. L-type lectins have also been found in the bark of some leguminous trees, and very low amounts of these lectins are also found in other vegetative tissues of legumes. In some cases, these latter lectins are encoded by separate but very similar genes. More than 100 of the seed legume L-type lectins have been characterized and are the most extensively studied proteins of this class. It also should be noted that the L-type fold has been observed in noncarbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectin-like receptor kinases in plants that are important in development and stress responses.A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet.The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand. An exception to this case is found in two lectins (ConA and the closely related Dioclea grandiflora lectin) in which the glycine is replaced with an arginine. Both the glycine and arginine form hydrogen bonds with the ligand via their main-chain amides. Loop C contains an invariant asparagine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via its side chain, and an invariant hydrophobic amino acid. Besides these invariant amino acids, backbone atoms of the residues of loop D also contribute to monosaccharide recognition.(Top) Three-dimensional structure of a peanut agglutinin (PNA) monomer showing the four loops involved in sugar binding: loops A, B, C, and D. The bound sugar (lactose) is shown as a “ball-and-stick” model. Calcium and manganese ions are (more...)The legume L-type lectins are generally classified into groups based on their carbohydrate specificities as often identified by the ability of monosaccharides to inhibit their agglutinating activity. These differences in specificities are brought about by variability in the conformation and size of the D loop and to some extent by the C loop. Although the main specificity regions of the legume lectins are determined by the loops, there are sites other than these that contribute to lectin specificity. There are several additional modes of refining these specificities, such as interaction with water, posttranslational modifications, and state of oligomerization.Legume L-type lectins are oligomeric—mostly dimeric or tetrameric in nature—and adopt a variety of quaternary structures. The back β-sheet in the monomeric unit is involved in oligomerization. Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class. Interestingly, some legume lectins have a hydrophobic binding site that binds adenine and adenine-derived plant hormones with micromolar affinity; this is two to three orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for monosaccharides. Three of these lectins (the soybean agglutinin, phytohemagglutinin L [PHAL], and Dolichos biflorus lectin) have been crystallized and found to have a unique tetrameric structure, in that the dimer–dimer interface creates a channel running through the center of the tetramer. Two identical adenine-binding sites are found at opposite ends of this channel.Another common feature of the legume lectins is that they are secretory proteins and undergo cotranslational signal peptide removal, which accompanies their entry into the secretory system. All but peanut agglutinin (PNA) are N-glycosylated as precursors; the N-glycans undergo normal posttranslational modification as they transit the Golgi apparatus. The lectins vary from one another as to whether the mature proteins contain oligomannose-type, complex-type, or a mixture of both types of N-glycans. The lectins may also undergo a variety of proteolytic modifications as they transit through the secretory system. Some of the lectins are cleaved to generate a β-chain, corresponding to the amino terminus and an α-chain corresponding to the carboxyl terminus. For example, the pea lectin and favin (the lectin from Vicia faba) are tetrameric glycoproteins that contain two types of subunits, α and β, which are ∼5 kDa and ∼21 kDa, respectively. These two lectins are each synthesized as single polypeptide precursors that contain the sequences of both chains in the following orientation: β-chain–α-chain. The chains associate to form dimers; they are then proteolytically processed in the protein bodies to form tetramers containing two separate α- and β-chains. Other lectins may undergo carboxy-terminal trimming of only some of their subunits. For example, the soybean agglutinin, phytohemagglutinin E (E-PHA), and D. biflorus lectins are tetramers of equimolar mixtures of intact and trimmed subunits.The most intriguing proteolytic modification occurs in the case of ConA. A small segment is removed from the interior of the protein and the original amino terminus is ligated with the original carboxyl terminus. This forms what is termed a circularly permuted protein. The N-glycosylated segment of the protein is removed during this transpeptidation process; thus, the mature ConA is not a glycoprotein, in contrast to most seed lectins in the Fabaceae family, which have N-glycans. Thus, the protein sequence of isolated ConA aligns with other seed lectins, whereas the alignment of the DNA encoding the protein with other lectin genes indicates that the gene is circularly permuted.Despite years of research, the intrinsic biological roles of L-type lectins are poorly understood. The glycan-binding specificity can vary significantly; ConA binds mannose and glucose-containing glycans, whereas the lectins from the trees Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra bind to sialylated glycans (see Chapters 15, 29, and 31). There is evidence from many approaches that the legume lectins are insecticidal, antifungal, and antimicrobial and can be toxic to animals that eat raw seeds. Thus, the seed lectins may function in plant immunity as a type of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to protect the offspring of the plant. As highly abundant seed constituents, the lectins could also serve as a storage protein for the plant development. L-type lectins are involved in the symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as in Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, but the precise function of lectins in this regard is unclear. A recent study has shown that the D. biflorus seed lectin is also a lipoxygenase. It will be of interest to see how many other L-type lectins have this activity, which is necessary to initiate the wound-induced defense pathway in plants.Regardless of their physiological function, legume L-type lectins might be useful in applications requiring agents with antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal or antinociceptive properties. In addition, given their well-established glycan recognition preferences, these plant lectins are useful for glycophenotyping different cell types in physiological and pathological settings by means of immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical analysis.Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) are homologous molecular chaperones that mediate quality control of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (see Chapter 39). Although CRT is a soluble ER luminal component, CNX is membrane-bound and is perhaps closely associated with the protein-translocating channel that imports nascent proteins into the ER. Both CNX and CRT bind to monoglucosylated, high-mannose-type glycans and prevent their exit from the ER until they are properly folded and assembled into correct quaternary structures (Chapter 39). For example, generation of a functional major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) depends on its association with CRT or CNX as component of a peptide-loading complex and the antigen presentation machinery. During the binding and dissociation from CRT or CNX, if the glycoprotein folds correctly, then glucose removal by glucosidase-II allows its passage out of the ER. If a glycoprotein misfolds or aggregates, it is reglucosylated by UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) containing four tandem thioredoxin-like domains; this enzyme only recognizes misfolded or aggregated glycoproteins. Following reglucosylation, the monoglucosylated protein binds again to CRT or CNX. Thus, there is a cycle of glucose removal and addition by the alternating actions of glucosidase-II and UGGT and interactions with CNX/CRT.Both CRT and CNX are Ca++-binding proteins, and their carbohydrate-binding activity is sensitive to changes in Ca++ concentration. CNX is a type I membrane protein with its carboxy-terminal end in the cytoplasm. The lumenal portion of the protein is divided into three domains: a Ca++-binding domain (which is adjacent to the transmembrane domain), a proline-rich long hairpin loop called the P domain, and the amino-terminal L-type lectin domain. CRT has a similar structure, but it is missing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions; it is retained in the ER through its KDEL-retrieval signal at the carboxyl terminus (Figure 32.4).Schematic representations of calreticulin (CRT) and calnexin (CNX) showing the lectin domain, the P domain (containing the proline repeats), and the calcium-binding domain (A,B). Structure of CNX based on crystallographic data (C). (Adapted, with permission (more...)ERGIC-53 (human gene LMAN1) and its sequence-related proteins ERGL and VIP36 are type I membrane proteins that participate in vesicular protein transport in the secretory system (see Chapter 39). All share an L-type lectin folding motif. Orthologs of ERGIC-53 are found in plants and all animals and have been independently identified as being important in production of infectious viruses (e.g., coronavirus and filovirus). ERGIC-53 occurs in the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and its cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus contains the dilysine/diphenylalanine KKFF retention/retrieval motif. The dilysine is recognized by the COPI coatomer complex; this binding enables the coated vesicles to be recycled from the ERGIC back to the ER. The diphenylalanine helps to direct the COPII-coated vesicles to ER export sites by binding to the COPII coatomer. The location of VIP36 (vesicular integral membrane protein 36) is uncertain; overexpressed protein has been found in both the ER and ERGIC, as well as cis-Golgi. ERGIC 53 can associate with the soluble ER partner MCFD2 (multiple coagulation factor deficiency protein 2), which forms a cargo receptor complex important in factor V and VIII biosynthesis. ERGIC-53 binds to N-linked glycans and allosterically activates MCFD2, which thereby becomes able to capture specific polypeptide segments of cargo glycoproteins. Human mutations in ERGIC-53 are associated with deficiencies of circulating blood clotting factors V and VIII, which are glycoproteins with multiple N-glycans. ERGIC-53-deficient mice show FV and FVIII deficiencies and liver ER distension, with accumulation of α1-antitrypsin and GRP78. Partially penetrant, perinatal lethality occurs, dependent on inbred genetic background, suggesting potential roles for as yet unidentified ERGIC-53-dependent cargo proteins.Both ERGIC-53 and VIP36 bind to oligomannose-type glycans and require Ca++ for their carbohydrate-binding activity. These two proteins were the first animal lectins found to share some sequence and structural homology with the legume seed lectins. Although the overall sequence identity of these proteins to the seed lectins is only ∼19%–24%, those amino acids important for metal and carbohydrate binding in the seed lectins are conserved, including the invariant aspartate, glycine, and asparagine. The invariant aspartate also participates in a cis-peptide bond with its preceding amino acid; this is similar to the case of the legume seed lectins discussed in the above section. The crystal structure of the lectin domain of ERGIC-53 has been determined and confirms the structural similarity of these lectins (Figure 32.4). In contrast to CRT/CNX, ERGIC-53 and VIP36 can bind the deglucosylated branch of high-mannose-type glycans and thereby contribute to vesicular transport of correctly folded glycoproteins in the early secretory pathway. During transport from the ER to the Golgi, release of cargo glycoproteins from ERGIC-53 is caused by the environmental acidification and a decrease in Ca++. Like ERGIC-53, ERGL can associate with MCFD2 and is probably involved in FV and FVIII transport. VIPL (VIP36-like) is an ER-resident protein and functionally able to bind deglucosylated high-mannose-type glycans, and associate with ERGIC-53, which may be important in regulating ERGIC-53 localization.A variety of other proteins have been described that have carbohydrate-binding domains with tertiary structures similar to the L-type lectin fold and may be considered as members of this family. Members of the galectin family of lectins also fit into this category and are the subject of a separate chapter in this volume (see Chapter 36). Other GBPs that may fit into this category are briefly discussed below.The pentraxins are a superfamily of plasma proteins that are involved in innate immunity in invertebrates and vertebrates and are designated as PRRs. They contain L-type lectin folds and require Ca++ ions for ligand binding. Their name is based on the pentameric arrangement of their subunits. The short PTX C-reactive protein (CRP), which binds phosphocholine residues on polysaccharides and on phospholipids, and the serum amyloid P (SAP) component, which also binds carbohydrate derivatives on bacterial polysaccharides and to amyloid fibrils, are acute-phase proteins in humans and mice, respectively. This family also contains long PTX that have an unrelated long amino-terminal domain coupled to the PTX domain and includes neuronal PTX 1, neuronal PTX 2, neuronal PTX receptor, PTX 3, and PTX 4. A prototypical member, PTX3 is a soluble pattern recognition molecule involved in innate immunity and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular inflammation, and cancer. In addition, PTX3 may also help in the assembly of a hyaluronan-rich extracellular matrix (ECM), which may involve binding to the hyaluronan–heavy chain-1 complex (inter-α-trypsin inhibitor or IαI or ITI) and regulation by TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6). Laminin G domain-like (LG) modules are made of 180–200 amino acid residues and were first identified in laminins. The carboxyl terminus of the laminin α-chain has five tandem laminin G domains, which are important in heparin and sulfatide binding and cell/basement membrane adhesion, such as to the novel glycans of α-dystroglycan (α-DG, see Chapter 13). Some LG modules share binding properties for cellular receptors and carbohydrate ligands, indicating that the LG fold may have evolved from the L-type lectin fold for participation in related functions.VP4 is the surface spike protein in rotaviruses and is proteolytically cleaved to generate VP8, which is a GBP, and VP5, a hydrophobic region required for membrane entry. VP8 has an L-type lectin fold and structural features in common with galectins. This domain is required for infectivity of most animal rotaviruses. In some rotavirus strains, VP8 binds sialylated glycans, whereas most rotavirus VP8 recognizes type 1 and/or type 2 N- or O-glycans lacking sialic acid (Sia) and can especially bind to human milk oligosaccharides with appropriate sequences.A number of proteins are known to contain the jelly-roll motif found in L-type lectins. These include the binding domain of Clostridium neurotoxins, which can bind to gangliosides (e.g., GT1b and GD1b, see Chapter 11); Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A in which one of its three domains, the amino-terminal domain Ia, displays an L-type lectin structure; Vibrio cholerae sialidase, a three-domain protein with a six-bladed β-propeller neuraminidase domain flanked by two L-type lectin domains; and the Leech intramolecular trans-sialidase (TS), which has a multidomain architecture with a lectin-like domain II and an irregular β-stranded domain III that is built around a canonical catalytic domain C. Domain II may be involved in carbohydrate recognition through sugar ring and aromatic side-chain interactions, as observed in many lectins.Although the L-type lectin domain occurs in many proteins, in many cases evidence for carbohydrate binding and/or specificity is lacking. Examples include the L-type lectin receptor kinases (LecRKs) in plants, which is a large family of several thousand members comprising membrane receptors that are key to plant development, immunity, and adaptive responses to stimuli; and mammalian thrombospondins, a family of matricellular proteins implicated in angiogenesis and inflammation, including TSP-1, which has a carboxy-terminal domain that shows the typical β-sandwich of two curved antiparallel β-sheets, a feature of the jelly-roll topology, in which the L-type lectin domain is compactly assembled with three calcium-binding type 3 (T3) repeatsThe authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Yasuhiro Ozeki.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.33Nancy Dahms, Thomas Braulke, and Ajit Varki.Lysosomes are intracellular membrane-bound organelles that turn over and degrade many types of macromolecules, via the action of lysosomal enzymes (also called acid hydrolases because of the low-pH characteristic of lysosomes). These enzymes are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on membrane-bound ribosomes and traverse the ER–Golgi pathway along with other newly synthesized proteins. At the terminal Golgi compartment, they are segregated from other glycoproteins and selectively delivered to lysosomes. In most “higher” animal cells, this specialized trafficking is achieved primarily through the recognition of N-glycans containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) by “P-type” lectins. As the first clear-cut example of a biological role for glycans on mammalian glycoproteins and the first shown link between glycoprotein biosynthesis and human disease, the interesting history of its discovery is described in some detail. More recent data on other proteins with “P-type” lectin domains are also mentioned.Early studies of human genetic “storage disorders” by Elizabeth Neufeld indicated a failure to degrade cellular components, which therefore accumulated in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Soluble corrective factors from normal cells could reverse these defects when added to the culture media. These factors were later identified as lysosomal enzymes that were found to be deficient in patients with storage disorders. These enzymes, secreted in small quantities by normal cells in culture, or by cells from patients with a different “complementary” defect (Figure 33.1), existed in two forms: a “high-uptake” form, recognized by saturable, high-affinity receptors that could correct the defect in deficient cells, and an inactive “low-uptake” form that could not correct.Cross-correction of lysosomal enzyme deficiencies in cultured cells. Small amounts of high-uptake lysosomal enzymes secreted by normal fibroblasts (thin arrows) were taken up by fibroblasts from a patient with a genetic lack of a single lysosomal enzyme, (more...)Fibroblasts from patients with a rare genetic disease showing prominent inclusion bodies in cultured cells (therefore termed “I-cell” disease) were found to be deficient in almost all lysosomal enzymes. Interestingly, all these enzymes are actually synthesized by I-cells, but are mostly secreted into the medium, instead of being retained in lysosomes. Neufeld showed that although I-cells incorporated the high-uptake enzymes secreted by normal cells, enzymes secreted by I-cells were not taken up by other cells (Figure 33.1). She therefore proposed that I-cell disease results from a failure to add a common recognition marker to lysosomal enzymes. This marker was assumed to be responsible for the proper trafficking of newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes in normal cells. The “high-uptake” property was destroyed by strong periodate treatment, which oxidizes vicinal hydroxyl groups in glycans, predicting that the recognition marker was a glycan.High uptake of lysosomal enzymes was next found, by William Sly, to be blocked by M6P and its stereoisomer fructose 1-phosphate, but not by other sugar phosphates. Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis. The groups of Stuart Kornfeld and Kurt von Figura then found, surprisingly, that some of the M6P moieties were “blocked” by α-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to the phosphate residue, creating a phosphodiester.Comparison of glycans with phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters predicted that the metabolic precursor of the M6P determinant was a phosphodiester and that phosphorylation was mediated not by an ATP-dependent kinase but by a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This was proven using a double-labeled donor and Golgi extracts:Another Golgi enzyme phosphodiester glycosidase was shown to remove the outer N-acetylglucosamine residue and “uncover” the M6P moiety. Pulse-chase studies confirmed the order of events, documenting that multiple glycans on a given lysosomal enzyme could acquire one or two phosphate residues and that removal of some mannose residues on the N-glycan by processing Golgi mannosidases was also required (Figure 33.2). In most cell types, the phosphate is eventually lost after exposure to acid phosphatases 5 and 2 (ACP5, ACP2) in lysosomes. The overall biochemical pathway is shown in Figure 33.2.Pathways for biosynthesis of N-glycans bearing the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. Following early N-glycan processing (Chapter 9), a single GlcNAc phosphodiester is added to the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes on one of three mannose (Man) (more...)The first two enzymes that mediate these reactions were then purified and characterized and the encoding genes cloned. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-P-T) is an α2β2γ2 complex encoded by two genes. The α- and β-subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene, whose 1256 amino acid type-III transmembrane product undergoes proteolysis in the Golgi by site-1-protease (S1P) to give rise to the two subunits, whereas the 305 amino acid γ-subunit is encoded by the GNPTG gene (Figure 33.3). The α/β subunits contain the catalytic function of the enzyme (Stealth domains) as well as elements (Notch1, Notch2, and DMAP [DNA-methylase-associated protein]) that mediate binding to protein determinants present on the lysosomal enzymes. The γ-subunit facilitates the phosphorylation of a subset of the lysosomal enzymes. It contains an M6P receptor homology (MRH) domain that is thought to bind oligomannosyl N-glycans on the lysosomal enzymes and present them to the catalytic site for phosphorylation, and a DMAP recognition domain. The second enzyme, α-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester glycosidase encoded by the NAGPA gene, is a complex of four identical 68-kDa subunits, arranged as two disulfide-linked homodimers. Unlike other Golgi enzymes, this is a type-I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with its amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi.GlcNAc-P-T is an α2β2γ2 hexamer encoded by two genes. The GNPTAB gene encodes a catalytically inactive type 3 transmembrane precursor that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage between Lys-928 and Asp-929 in the Golgi by site-1-protease (more...)The oligomannosyl N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes are identical to those of many other glycoproteins passing through the ER–Golgi pathway. Thus, specific recognition by GlcNAc-P-T is crucial to achieve selective trafficking. This recognition is not explained by any similarities in the primary polypeptide sequences of lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, denatured lysosomal enzymes lose their specialized GlcNAc-P-T acceptor activity, indicating that features of secondary or tertiary structure are critical for recognition. Two complementary approaches were used to define elements of this recognition marker. In loss-of-function studies, various amino acids of the lysosomal enzyme were replaced with alanine, and the effect on phosphorylation determined. In gain-of-function experiments, residues of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D were substituted into the homologous secretory protease glycopepsinogen. These studies revealed that select lysine residues have a critical role in the interaction with GlcNAc-P-T. In fact, as few as two lysines in the correct orientation to each other and to an N-glycan can serve as minimal elements of the recognition domain. However, additional amino acid residues enhance the interaction with GlcNAc-P-T. In some instances (e.g., cathepsin D), the enzyme may contain a very extended determinant, or perhaps, more than one recognition domain.The GlcNAc phosphodiester glycosidase that catalyzes the exposure of the M6P recognition marker is found primarily in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and it cycles between this compartment and the plasma membrane. Thus, “uncovering” the recognition marker is a late event in the Golgi apparatus, occurring just before loading of the enzymes onto the M6P receptors (MPRs).Fibroblasts from patients with I-cell disease (also called mucolipidosis-II; ML-II) revealed a complete deficiency in GlcNAc-P-T enzyme activity. A milder variant called pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis-III; ML-III) subclassified by sequencing into MLIIIα/β or MLIIIγ showed a less severe deficiency of enzyme activity. Metabolic radiolabeling of fibroblasts corroborated the failure to phosphorylate mannose residues in these diseases, and asymptomatic obligate heterozygotes showed a partial deficiency, with slightly elevated levels of serum lysosomal enzymes. Mutations of various types in the two GlcNAc-P-T genes have since been detected in almost all patients with ML-II and -III examined, indicating that deficiency of this enzyme is the primary genetic cause of the disorder.The first candidate (∼275-kDa) receptor for the M6P recognition marker was isolated by affinity chromatography and found to bind M6P in the absence of cations (CI-MPR [cation-independent MPR]). Certain cells deficient in this receptor still showed M6P-inhibitable binding of lysosomal enzymes, leading to the discovery of a second MPR of ∼45 kDa, which required divalent cations for optimal binding (CD-MPR [cation-dependent MPR]). Both receptors bind with highest affinity to glycans carrying two M6P residues (Figure 33.2, structure C) whereas only the CI-MPR interacts with molecules bearing GlcNAc-P-Man phosphodiesters (Figure 33.2, structures A and B). Binding to molecules carrying one M6P (Figure 33.2, structure D) is intermediate in affinity. Removal of outer mannose residues by processing Golgi mannosidases enhances binding.Genes encoding both MPRs have been cloned and extensively characterized. Both are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with extracytoplasmic, transmembrane, and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The CI-MPR has 15 contiguous repetitive units of ∼145 amino acids with partial identity to one another. The CD-MPR has a single extracellular domain, showing homology with the repeating domains of the CI-MPR (Figure 33.4A). Together with conservation of certain intron–exon boundaries, this homology suggests that the two genes evolved from a common ancestor. On the basis of their sequence relationships and unique binding properties to M6P, the two MPRs have been formally classified as P-type lectins. Structural homologs of the MPRs are present in yeast and Drosophila, but these proteins lack M6P-binding ability.(A) Schematic diagram of cation-independent (CI-MPR) and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CD-MPR). (B) Ribbon diagram of the bovine CD-MPR. Shown are the two monomers (magenta and cyan ribbons) of the dimer as well as the ligand M6P (gold (more...)The CD-MPR exists mainly as a dimer, with each monomer binding one M6P residue. The CI-MPR also seems to be a dimer in the membrane, although it readily dissociates on solubilization. Two of its repeating units (3 and 9) bind M6P phosphomonoesters with high affinity, a third (5) binds M6P phosphodiesters, and a fourth (15) binds both M6P phosphomonoesters and diesters with equal affinity. Mutagenesis studies have identified the specific residues of these receptors involved in M6P binding, and crystal structures of several M6P-binding domains have been obtained in complex with M6P. Comparison of the binding pockets reveals four residues (Gln, Arg, Glu, Tyr) are positionally conserved and form the same contacts with the mannose ring. The CD-MPR has been crystallized as a dimer, with each monomer folded into a nine-stranded flattened β-barrel that has a striking resemblance to the protein folds in avidin (Figure 33.4B). The distance between the two ligand-binding sites of the dimer provides a good explanation for the differences in binding affinity shown by the CD-MPR toward various lysosomal enzymes. Crystal structures of recombinant forms of the CI-MPR have also been solved that encompass all but two of the 15 contiguous domains in its extracellular region (i.e., domains 1–5, domains 7–11, and domains 11–14). Each domain shows a topology similar to that of the CD-MPR. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the CI-MPR isolated from bovine liver has been carried out under conditions: (1) not conducive to ligand binding (pH 4.5), and (2) found at the cell surface (pH 7.4) and bound to the non-glycosylated ligand, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) via CI-MPR\\'s domain 11. Although the cryo-EM structure at pH 7.4 is unable to visualize the N- (domains 1–3) and C- (domain 15) termini with sufficient resolution, it does provide insight into the arrangement of the entire extracellular region of the CI-MPR. The proposed cryo-EM model does not position the two M6P-binding domains (3 and 9) sufficiently close to bind a single, diphosphorylated N-glycan. This suggests that the high-affinity binding of this N-glycan is due to the spanning of binding sites located on different monomers of the CI-MPR. An alternative possibility is that the receptor is dynamic, with the spacing between the two M6P-binding sites being flexible, to enhance interactions with lysosomal enzymes containing phosphorylated glycans at various positions on their protein backbones. The dynamic nature of the receptor is supported by structural and biophysical studies which show that the conformation of the CI-MPR is affected by pH. The CI-MPR adopts a more compact structure under acidic conditions that may facilitate unloading of lysosomal enzymes in the acidic environment of endosomal compartments.Targeted disruption of the CD-MPR gene in mice is associated with normal or only slightly elevated levels of lysosomal enzymes in the circulation and an otherwise grossly normal phenotype. However, thymocytes or primary cultured fibroblasts from such mice show an increase in the amount of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes secreted into the medium. This indicates that mechanisms exist, which can compensate for the deficiency in vivo. Intravenous injection of inhibitors of other glycan-specific receptors capable of mediating endocytosis (e.g., the mannose receptor of macrophages and the asialoglycoprotein receptor of hepatocytes; see Chapter 34) gives rise to a marked increase in lysosomal enzymes in the serum of the deficient mice. Thus, such receptors are likely part of the compensatory mechanisms in vivo.Like fibroblasts that lack only CD-MPR, fibroblasts that lack only CI-MPR have a partial impairment in sorting. Fibroblasts from embryos that lack both receptors show a massive missorting of multiple lysosomal enzymes. Thus, both receptors are required for efficient intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes. Comparison of lysosomal enzymes secreted by the different cell types indicates that the two receptors may interact preferentially with different subgroups of enzymes. Thus, the structural heterogeneity of the M6P recognition marker within a single lysosomal enzyme and between different enzymes is one explanation for the evolution of two MPRs with complementary binding properties: that is, to provide an efficient but varied targeting of lysosomal proteins in different cell types or tissues. What initially appeared to be a precise lock-and-key mechanism turned out to be a far more complex and flexible system, with functionally useful biological flexibility.At steady state, MPRs are concentrated in the TGN and late endosomes, but they cycle constitutively between these organelles, early (sorting) endosomes, recycling endosomes, and the plasma membrane (Figure 33.5). MPRs avoid delivery to lysosomes, in which they would be degraded. This trafficking is governed by a number of short amino acid sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. The TGN is the site in which newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes bind to MPRs that are then collected into clathrin-coated pits and packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to the early endosome. This process involves interaction of the MPRs with two types of coat proteins: the GGAs (Golgi-localized, γ-ear–containing, ADP-ribosylation factor binding) and AP1 (adapter protein 1). In addition to binding MPRs, the coat proteins recruit clathrin for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles. Following delivery to early endosomes, lysosomal enzymes are released from MPRs as the endosomes mature to late endosomes and the pH decreases. Late endosomes then undergo dynamic fusion/fission with lysosomes, allowing selective transfer of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes and leaving the MPRs behind in subdomains of the late endosomes. These MPRs may then either return to the TGN mediated by a multiprotein retromer complex or move to the plasma membrane, in which internalization via clathrin-coated pits occurs, mediated by the coat protein AP2. There are several pathways for the MPRs to be returned to the TGN from the various endosomal compartments, although the relative importance of the different pathways is unclear.Subcellular trafficking pathways of glycoproteins, lysosomal enzymes, and M6P receptors (MPRs). Newly synthesized glycoproteins originating from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pass through the Golgi stacks and are then sorted to various destinations. (more...)The original experiments of Neufeld showed that a portion of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the medium, but may be recaptured by the same cell or by adjacent cells expressing cell-surface CI-MPRs (Figure 33.1). Enzymes that bind to such cell-surface MPRs are endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, eventually reaching the same late endosomal compartments in which newly synthesized molecules arrive from the Golgi. This secretion–recapture pathway is a minor one in most cells, but plays a critical role in enzyme replacement therapy.As described in Chapter 44, there are many genetic disorders in glycan degradation that result from decreased activity of a given lysosomal enzyme. Some of these enzymes that are targeted to lysosomes via the M6P pathway have been prepared in large quantities as recombinant soluble proteins and used in enzyme replacement therapy. To date, the benefits have been variable but less than optimal. There are a number of potential reasons for this. First, some of the preparations may not contain the physiologic complement of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker. It is reasonable to suggest that a greater M6P content may improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement in these patients. This has been shown to be the case in mouse and dog model systems. However, even with fully phosphorylated enzymes there may be obstacles that are difficult to overcome. For example, some cell types in the body may not express adequate levels of the CI-MPR on their surfaces to endocytose sufficient enzyme to restore normal lysosomal function. Also, the organ that is most seriously affected in many of these diseases (the brain) is inaccessible because of the blood–brain barrier. Although the first intraventricular M6P-dependent enzyme replacement therapy for children deficient for the lysosomal tripeptidyl peptidase 1 are very promising, further studies are needed.Although the MPR pathway has a major role in vertebrate lysosomal enzyme trafficking, its contribution in invertebrate systems is not prominent. Lysosomal enzymes are targeted in organisms such as Saccharomyces, Trypanosoma, and Dictyostelium, without the aid of identifiable MPRs. The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum produces a novel methylphosphomannose structure on some of its lysosomal enzymes that can be recognized in vitro by the mammalian CI-MPR (not the CD-MPR). However, despite the presence of a GlcNAc-P-T that recognizes α1-2-linked mannose residues, the enzyme does not specifically recognize lysosomal enzymes, and no receptor for M6P has been found in this organism. Additionally, the Dictyostelium GlcNAc-P-T appears to differ from its mammalian hexameric counterpart because sequences related to the γ subunit have not been found in the Dictyostelium genome. The protozoan Acanthamoeba produces a GlcNAc-P-T that specifically recognizes lysosomal enzymes. However, this organism lacks a gene that could encode an “uncovering” enzyme, and so would not be expected to form M6P available to an MPR. Although some additional “lower” organisms do show evidence for an uncovering enzyme, no MPR activity has yet been found. The evolutionary divergence point at which the complete MPR system became established remains to be defined.Although originally discovered as a receptor for lysosomal enzyme trafficking, the CI-MPR turns out to be a remarkably multifunctional molecule (Figure 33.4A). It binds IGF-II with high affinity even though this polypeptide lacks M6P residues. Many studies have explored potential interactions between these two disparate ligands. Although these two ligands bind to distinct sites on the CI-MPR receptor, there are conflicting reports regarding synergistic or antagonistic interactions between the two activities. Regardless, it appears that the CI-MPR acts primarily as a general “sink” for excess IGF-II in the extracellular fluid, carrying it to the lysosome for degradation, and reducing the amount available to bind to the IGF-I receptor. Several reports indicate that binding of IGF-II to the CI-MPR regulates motility and growth in some cell types. It has also been found that the CI-MPR binds retinoic acid with high affinity at a site that is distinct from those for M6P and IGF-II. This binding of retinoic acid seems to enhance the primary functions of the CI-MPR receptor, and the biological consequence appears to be the suppression of cell proliferation and/or induction of apoptosis. The significance of this unexpected observation is still being explored. Other ligands include urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen, their functional significance is currently unknown.There are also some unexplained changes in CI-MPR expression in relation to malignancy. Loss of heterozygosity at the CI-MPR locus occurs in dysplastic liver lesions and in hepatocellular carcinomas associated with the high-risk factors of hepatitis virus infection and liver cirrhosis. Mutations in the remaining allele were detected in ∼50% of these tumors, which also seem to frequently develop from clonal expansions of phenotypically normal, CI-MPR-mutated hepatocytes. Thus, the CI-MPR fulfills many of the classic criteria to be classified as a liver “tumor-suppressor” gene.Interestingly, M6P-containing N-glycans have been found on a variety of nonlysosomal proteins. Some are hydrolytic enzymes that seem to have taken on a predominantly secretory route, for example, uteroferrin and DNase I. In the first case, the failure of removal of the blocking N-acetylglucosamine residues may be the cause for secretion. With DNase I, the native level of phosphorylation simply appears to be low. M6P has also been found on the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) precursor and the phosphate is lost from the mature form. It appears that M6P may serve to target the precursor to CI-MPR for activation. However, like DNase I, the native level of phosphorylation of TGF-β appears to be low. Other nonlysosomal proteins reported to carry M6P include proliferin, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), and thyroglobulin. In the last case, M6P-containing N-glycans are suggested as a mechanism to target the protein for degradation and release of thyroid hormones. But one should not necessarily assume that M6P-containing N-glycans on all of these proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking. Just as phosphorylation of serine residues has diverse biological roles, M6P might be used for more than one purpose in a complex multicellular organism.Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoproteins have also been shown to carry N-glycans with M6P. In these cases, M6P is on complex N-glycans, suggesting that it originates from a distinct biosynthetic pathway. Regardless of its mode of synthesis, interaction of cell-free VZV with CI-MPR at the cell surface is required for viral entry into endosomes. Interestingly, intracellular CI-MPR can also divert newly synthesized enveloped VZV to late endosomes in which the virions are inactivated before exocytosis. This is suggested as the mechanism by which this successful pathogen limits immediate excessive spread and avoids killing the host or, possibly, a form of host defense. Biopsies of VZV-infected human skin showed that CI-MPR expression is lost in maturing superficial epidermal cells, preventing diversion of VZV to endosomes and allowing constitutive secretion of infectious VZV. These data implicate CI-MPR in the complex biology of VZV infection.Although the M6P recognition marker has a crucial role in trafficking newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to vertebrate lysosomes, alternate mechanisms exist in some cell types. In patients with I-cell disease some cells and tissues, such as the liver and circulating granulocytes, have essentially normal levels of enzymes. B-lymphoblast lines derived from these patients also do not show the complete phenotype of enzyme deficiency seen in fibroblasts. One possible explanation is that the M6P pathway for trafficking of lysosomal enzymes is a specialized form of targeting, superimposed on some other basic mechanisms that more primitive organisms use, some of which remain undefined. In this regard, two lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase ACP2 and β-glucocerebrosidase, are not at all affected in their distribution in I-cell disease fibroblasts. With ACP2, the enzyme is synthesized initially as a membrane-bound protein, and once in the lysosome, it is proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature soluble form. Glucocerebrosidase is targeted to lysosomes independently of the MPR pathway by forming a complex with LIMP-2, a lysosomal membrane protein that contains a targeting signal in its cytoplasmic tail. Likewise, other integral membrane proteins of the lysosome use similar targeting motifs in their cytoplasmic tails to traffic to the lysosome. Furthermore, several M6P-independent cargo receptors for the transport of lysosomal enzymes have been identified such as the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), LRP2 (megalin), sortilin, and mannose receptors.A small number of proteins have now been identified that are related to the P-type lectins because of the presence of MRH domains. These MRH domains contain the residues that bind mannose, but lack the residues that bind phosphate. In several instances, the proteins have been shown to bind to oligomannosyl structures. Most of these proteins reside in the ER where they function either as lectins (e.g., OS-9 and XTP3-B) or as glycosidases (e.g., glucosidase II) in the ER quality control pathway. Interestingly, the γ-subunit of GlcNAc-P-T has an MRH domain that plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of a subset of lysosomal enzymes. Similar to GlcNAc-P-T, it has been proposed that the MRH domain in the β-subunit of glucosidase II acts to optimally present the glycan to the catalytic α-subunit of this heterodimeric enzyme for efficient removal of glucose residues. The precise biologic role of these MRH domains remains to be elucidated.The authors appreciate the contributions of Stuart Kornfeld to the earlier edition and helpful comments and suggestions from Sneha Komath and Anne Imberty.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.34Richard D. Cummings, Elise Chiffoleau, Yvette van Kooyk, and Rodger P. McEver.C-type lectins (CTLs) are Ca++-dependent glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that share primary and secondary structural homology in their carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). The CRD of CTLs is more generally defined as the CTL domain (CTLD), because not all proteins with this domain bind either glycans or Ca++. CTLs include collectins, selectins, endocytic receptors, and proteoglycans, some of which are secreted and others are transmembrane proteins. They often oligomerize, which increases their avidity for multivalent ligands and enhance recognition of pattern recognition receptor (PRRs). CTLs differ significantly in the types of ligands that they recognize with high affinity (e.g., glycans, proteins, lipids, and inorganic compounds). These proteins that recognize pathogens or self-expressed ligands function as adhesion, phagocytic, and signaling receptors in many pathways, including homeostasis and innate and adaptive immunity, and are crucial in inflammatory responses, leukocyte and platelet trafficking, and tissue remodeling.The CTL family is remarkably diverse and is the largest family of known GBPs. The first CTL identified in animals was the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), also termed the hepatic Gal/GalNAc receptor or Ashwell–Morell receptor (AMR). The sequences of the AMR and other CTLs revealed a CRD unique to this family of proteins. Glycan binding by CTLs is typically Ca++-dependent because of specific amino acid residues that coordinate Ca++ and bind the hydroxyl groups of sugars, but some CTLDs bind glycans without coordinating Ca++. The CTLD is defined by the sequence of amino acids and Cys positions, as well as the folded structure. Interestingly, comparisons of the folded structure of the CTLD to that in other proteins revealed a common folded structure, termed the CTL fold (CTLF), which is a structurally rigid scaffold that comprises a remarkable number of sequence variations, yet may have no sequence in common with CTLs, such as the major tropism determinant (Mtd), which is a receptor-binding protein of Bordetella bacteriophage. The evolutionarily ancient CTLF may occur in at least 1013 different sequences, a diversity that rivals the immunoglobulin fold in its conservation of structure using millions of different primary amino acid sequences.The CRD of CTLs is a compact region of 110–130 amino acid residues with a double-looped, two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet formed by the amino- and carboxy-terminal residues connected by two α-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Figure 34.1). The CRD has two conserved disulfide bonds and up to four sites for binding Ca++, with site occupancy depending on the lectin. Amino acid residues with carbonyl side chains are often coordinated to Ca++ in the CRD, and these residues directly bind to sugars when Ca++ is bound in site 2. A ternary complex may form between a sugar, the Ca++ ion in site 2, and amino acids within the CRD, whereas the specific residues within the CRD determine sugar specificity. Key conserved residues that bind sugars include the “EPN” motif (which promotes binding to Man, GlcNAc, Fuc, and Glc) and “WND” motif (which promotes binding to Gal and GalNAc), as seen in mouse L-selectin and rat mannose-binding protein C (Figure 34.1). However, because the CTLD is relatively shallow with few contacts to sugars, it is not possible to predict the glycan structures that bind to a particular CTL. In several CTLs, such as P-selectin and the AMR, Ca++ binding induces structural changes in the CRD that stabilize the double-loop region. Loss of Ca++ can lead to destabilization of these loops and loss of ligand binding, even when Ca++ is not directly involved in complexing the ligand, as seen in the macrophage mannose receptor. This destabilization is also important in pH-induced changes that lead to loss of ligand-binding affinity, because of the pH-induced loss of Ca++. In CTLD-containing proteins such as human tetranectin, which is not known to bind glycans, the CTLD can bind Ca++, but in the absence of Ca++ the CTLD is important for interactions with kringle-domain-containing proteins, such as plasminogen.Structure of C-type lectins (CTLs).

(Light green spheres) Ca++-binding sites, where 1 is the auxiliary binding site and 2 is the principal binding (more...)CTLs occur as both monomers and oligomers, such as the trimeric rat mannose-binding protein (MBP)-A (Figure 34.2). The rat MBP was the first CTL structurally characterized with ligand by crystallography. The CRD of trimeric lectins is angled to the side of the stalk domain through which the protein associates to form the trimer. The CRDs are at the top of the trimer and enhance multivalent interactions with glycan ligands.Crystal structure of trimeric rat mannose-binding protein-A complexed with α-methylmannoside. (Created from PDB deposited structure 1kwu and with permission of the American Society for Biochemistry and Biology from Ng KK, et al. 2002. J Biol Chem (more...)CTLDs have been categorized into 16 groups that are distinguished by their domain architecture. There are 86 proteins encoded in the human genome that contain a CTLD (mice have 123) (Figure 34.3). Most of these groups have a single CTLD, but the macrophage mannose receptor (group 6) is an example of a multi-CTLD protein and has eight of these domains. Several groups have CTLDs that lack critical Ca++ residues, but can bind glycans (e.g., dectin-1 and layilin in group 5); the REG group 7 lacks Ca++ binding but it is unclear whether they bind glycans, whereas tetranectin in group 9 binds Ca++ and again it is unclear if it binds glycans. From a functional perspective, we know most about collectins, endocytic receptors, myeloid lectins, and selectins, as discussed below.Different groups of C-type lectins (CTLs) and their domain structures. (A) Sixteen groups are shown, defined by their phylogenetic relationships and domain structures. Some of the groups are soluble proteins and others are transmembrane proteins. (B) (more...)CTLF-containing proteins are found in all metazoans and many nonmetazoans. This latter group includes bacterial toxins (e.g., pertussis toxin), outer-membrane adhesion proteins (e.g., invasin from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis), and viral proteins (e.g., envelope protein in Epstein–Barr virus). Interestingly, the viral proteins have more similarity to mammalian CTLD-containing proteins than the bacterial proteins. There are at least 278 genes encoding CTLDs within the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, but only a small number have the key amino acid residues required to form the primary Ca++ binding site.The AMR is expressed primarily on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes and was discovered serendipitously during studies on clearance of the serum glycoprotein ceruloplasmin, a major copper carrier in mammalian plasma. Glycosylation of ceruloplasmin was found to regulate its lifetime in the rabbit circulation; enzymatic desialylation of radiolabeled ceruloplasmin exposed penultimate β-linked Gal residues and caused rapid accumulation of asialoceruloplasmin into hepatocytes. Removal or modification of the exposed Gal residues lessened the rate of clearance. In 1974, the Ca++-dependent AMR was purified from rabbit liver by affinity chromatography on asialoorosomucoid-Sepharose. The rabbit AMR is a heterooligomer containing two subunits of 48 kDa and 40 kDa, whereas the human AMR contains two subunits of 50 kDa (H1) and 46 kDa (H2) that occur as a heterooligomeric type I transmembrane protein (trimers and high-order oligomers) comprised of small and large subunits.The purified rabbit AMR agglutinated desialylated human and rabbit erythrocytes and induced mitogenesis in desialylated peripheral lymphocytes, which represented the first demonstration that an animal GBP could profoundly affect cellular metabolism. Interestingly, hepatic AMR can also recognize some sialylated ligands (Siaα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R). A homologous GBP identified in chicken hepatocytes recognizes glycoproteins containing terminal GlcNAc, rather than Gal, residues. Interestingly, circulating glycoproteins in birds constitutively lack sialic acid (Sia) compared with their mammalian counterparts.The AMR was one of the first proteins shown to participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) and, along with the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, transferrin receptor, and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), represents some of the best characterized receptors. The AMR internalizes its ligands captured at the cell surface at physiological pH; via coated pits, the AMR in complex with its ligand is internalized into coated vesicles (Figure 34.4), and changes in pH in late endosomes lead to dissociation of Ca++ from the AMR and release of ligand. The uncomplexed AMR then recycles to the plasma membrane, whereas the ligand is delivered to lysosomes where it is degraded. For some nonrecycling receptors (e.g., dendritic cell [DC]-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin [DC-SIGN]), both the ligand and receptor are targeted to lysosomes and degraded. Internalization of ligands by the AMR in hepatocytes is rapid, occurring in 2–3 minutes, and the receptor recycles to the surface within 4–5 minutes. The efficiency of the AMR in endocytosis has led it to be a target for gene therapy and delivery of molecules to hepatocytes.Some C-type lectins (CTLs) are endocytic receptors. Ligands are internalized by clathrin-dependent pathways and delivered to early and then late endosomes. Receptors may be recycled or degraded, depending on the receptor and the type of ligand it endocytoses. (more...)The precise orientation of the trimers within the AMR can dictate its affinity to specific glycans that have multivalent presentations. The AMR binds glycans with terminal β-linked Gal or GalNAc residues; however, tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans, with appropriate branching and presentation of nonreducing terminal Gal/GalNAc, bind to the rat AMR with >100,000× higher affinity (∼nm range) than ligands with a single terminal Gal/GalNAc residue.Surprisingly, mice null for the AMR were found to be phenotypically normal without challenge. However, it is now known that the AMR is required to clear platelets (thrombocytes) during Streptococcus pneumoniae–related sepsis, which is accompanied by microbial-dependent desialylation of platelets and consequent thrombocytopenia. Clearance helps to limit disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) caused by the infection. Such clearance of platelets during sepsis or as a result of platelet aging is also linked to production of thrombopoietin that regulates platelet production.Many other CTLs, both type I and type II transmembrane proteins, also deliver bound ligands to lysosomes via RME through their cytoplasmic motifs (Figure 34.4). Endocytosis of ligands by CTLs in DCs and macrophages can lead to receptor accumulation and degradation in phagolysosomes or to recycling of the receptor to the cell surface. The pathway taken is dependent on the bound ligand. Dectin-1 is degraded when it internalizes zymosan, but it is recycled when it endocytoses soluble ligands. Stimulation of CTLs such as dectin-1 in myeloid cells activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and enhances transcription of genes important in innate immune responses. Internalization of antigens via the CTLs in DCs induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other responses. CLEC9A (DNGR-1) and the mannose receptor divert cargo away from lysosomal compartments to allow retrieval of antigens for cross-presentation.Clustering and density of the CTLDs may determine both their specificity and their affinity for ligands because each individual CRD can act independently to bind sugar. Although the hepatic lectins subunits have a single CTLD, the macrophage mannose receptor has eight CTLDs in a single polypeptide. The adjacent CTLDs may promote binding to specific multivalent, mannose-containing glycans. The macrophage mannose receptor internalizes lysosomal enzymes containing oligomannose-type N-glycans and facilitates phagocytosis of several pathogens such as yeast, Pneumocystis carinii, and Leishmania. Interestingly, domains in some CTLs outside of the CTLD may also have receptor activity. For example, the cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor is an R-type domain (Chapter 31) that binds to glycans containing R-GalNAc-4-SO4 on pituitary glycoprotein hormones and thus acts to clear these hormones from the circulation.The collectins are a family of soluble and membrane-bound CTLs that contain a collagen-like domain amino-terminal to the CTLD and usually assemble in large oligomeric complexes containing 9–27 subunits (Figure 34.3). Bovine conglutinin was identified in the early 1900s by Bordet and Streng as a plasma protein that agglutinated erythrocytes following reactions with antibody and complement, now known to be through Ca++-dependent interactions with the exposed glycans on iC3b after proteolytic conversion from C3b. Bovine conglutinin and human conglutinin bind yeast glycans, and GlcNAc can inhibit interactions. The term conglutinin was coined in 1993 based on evidence that conglutinin had a collagen-like sequence and exhibited lectin activity. To date, nine different collectins have been identified: conglutinin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D (which were originally found in the lung but also expressed in the intestine), and collectins CL-43, CL-46, CL-P1, CL-L1, and CL-K1. MBL, conglutinin, CL-43, CL-46, CL-K1, SP-A, and SP-D are soluble, whereas CL-L1 and CL-P1 are membrane proteins.Collectins are pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) functioning in innate immunity that bind to surfaces of microbes or fungi expressing glycan ligands termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Thus, collectins and many other CTLs in myeloid cells, as discussed above, function as PRRs and cooperate with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in recognition and responses of cells to pathogens. Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), β-glucans, lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), and glycoproteins of parasites. Collectins stimulate in vitro phagocytosis by recognizing PAMPs, and binding promotes leukocyte chemotaxis and stimulates the production of cytokines and ROS by immune cells. Lung surfactant lipids have the ability to suppress a number of immune cell functions such as proliferation, and this suppression of the immune response is further augmented by SP-A.Binding of MBL and other collectins initiates the lectin pathway of complement activation. Such collectins are associated with proenzyme forms of MBL-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (MASP-1 and -2), in which binding to ligand by the CRD activates MASP-1 to cleave MASP-2, which then activates complement via the classical pathway and generates opsonic C3b fragments that coat pathogens and lead to their destruction and phagocytosis. Some individuals with MBL deficiency syndrome have mutations in the Gly-X-Y repeat encoded within exon-1 of the MBL gene (MBL2). Mutations within exon-1, which are highly variable among human populations, inhibit assembly of the MBL subunit, leading to increased risk of microbial infections. Furthermore, several polymorphisms within the promoter region of MBL2 are associated with MBL deficiency and enhanced susceptibility to infections. Genetic variants of MBL2 are also associated with Crohn\\'s disease. In addition, polymorphisms in MASP1 and MASP2 are associated with altered serum levels and compromised activity of collectins. Activation of these proteases can also lead to prothrombin cleavage and promote clot formation.Myeloid cells, which include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs, have a large number of proteins with CTLDs, which belong mainly to groups 2, 5, and 6 (Figure 34.3). Myeloid cells also express many members of the galectin and Siglec families of lectins. All leukocytes express L-selectin (group 4), which is discussed below in a separate section on selectins. Group 2 CTLs are DC-SIGN (in humans, but there is no murine homolog), CD209a (also termed SIGN-R1 in mice, but there is no human homolog), macrophage CTL (MCL), dectin-2 (DC-associated C-type lectin-2), langerin, the macrophage galactose-binding lectin (MGL), DCIR and the macrophage inducible Ca++-dependent lectin (MINCLE) (CLEC4E); in group 5, Ca++-independent lectin dectin-1, LOX-1, CLEC12B, CLEC9A (DNGR-1), myeloid-DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1), CLEC-1, CLEC-2, and dendritic cell–associated lectin-1 (DCAL-1); and in group 6, Ca++-dependent macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) and DEC-205 (CD205).There are approximately 20 members of the natural killer (NK) cell receptor group 5 of CTLD-containing proteins in humans, and additional ones in mice. Many of the genes encoding the NK cell receptor group 5 are present on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 6. The dectin-1 cluster that is part of the NK gene complex of CTLDs (mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 12) includes dectin-1 (CLEC7A), CLEC-1 (CLEC1A), CLEC-2 (CLEC1B), LOX-1 (OLR), CLEC12b, and CLEC9A. These CTLD-containing receptors bind various ligands such as glycans, but also proteins, lipids, inorganic compounds, and even ice. The dectin-2 cluster of CTLDs (whose genes are clustered in the centromeric region of the NK gene cluster) and represent group 2 CTLs includes dectin-2 (CLEC6A), blood DC antigen 2 (BDCA-2) (CLEC4C), DC immunoactivating receptor (DCAR) Clec4b in mice, absent in humans), DC immunoreceptor (DCIR) (CLEC4A), CTL superfamily 8 (CLECSF8) (CLEC4D), and MINCLE (CLEC4E). Mice have the Ly49 family of receptors that contain CTLDs and are on murine chromosome 6. But the Ly49 members, also termed Ly49 NK cell receptors, may not bind sugar but primarily bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and MHC class I–like molecules expressed by viruses. These are most functionally related to the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in human NK cells and some T cells.Numerous myeloid proteins with CTLDs can recognize not only pathogen moieties for host defense, but also modified self-antigens such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dead cells. The glycan and nonglycan ligands for the myeloid CTLs are diverse. MINCLE can recognize characteristic PAMPs such as α-mannose-containing glycans and trehalose-6,6-dimycolate, a key glycolipid virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, and thus induce immune responses against infection. MINCLE also maintains self-homeostasis and monitors the internal environment by sensing damaged cells by recognizing SAP130, a component of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and the intracellular metabolite beta-glucosylceramide (β-GlcCer) both exposed by dying cells. BDCA-2 binds HIV-1 gp120 and galactose-containing glycans. Dectin-1, which binds ligands in the absence of Ca++, is the functional receptor for β-glucans, which are polymers of a backbone of β1-3-linked glucose and side chains of β1-6-linked glucose. Dectin-2 binds in a Ca++-dependent fashion to α-mannans, which are polymers of α1-6-linked mannose with α1-2-linked mannose side chains. Both dectin-1 and dectin-2 are important in fungal defense, and mice deficient in either one are more susceptible to specific yeast and fungal infections. Interestingly, these receptors also play an important role in sterile inflammation; their dysregulations can lead to the development of diverse pathologies such as autoimmune diseases or cancers. For example, Dectin-1, by binding galectin-9, suppresses macrophage activation and promotes tumor oncogenesis. CLEC12A tempers inflammation by recognizing monosodium urate crystal formed by crystallization of soluble uric acid following contact with extracellular sodium ions. CLEC9A (DNGR-1) binds F-actin exposed by dying cells and regulates innate and adaptive immunity by tempering immunopathology associated with tissue damage; it also regulates adaptive immunity during acute tissue damage and by promoting phagosomal rupture and cross-presentation of internalized dead cell-associated antigens to CD8+ T cells. It is not yet clear whether recognition of the endogenous and exogenous ligands involves similar binding sites in the CTLD. CLR signaling of both PAMPs released following viral infections and DAMP from collateral injured cells may ensure microbial control while preserving integrity of the infected organs.The various signaling pathways by which many of these myeloid CTLDs function is illustrated in Figure 34.5. Most of these proteins express immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in their cytoplasmic domain. An example is dectin-1, which contains an activating ITAM-like motif, and like other activatory ITAM CTLs, also contains a tri-acidic motif that promotes downstream signaling. Some CTLs in myeloid cells, such as MICL (CLEC12A) and macrophage antigen h (MAH) (CLEC12B), contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). Such motifs on phosphorylation recruit tyrosine phosphatases to negatively regulate signaling pathways. Some CLRs, such as DC-SIGN, utilize alternative pathways (e.g., the serine/threonine kinase RAF-1). In fact, the same CLR can vary in function according to the ligand (physical nature, affinity, avidity) and thereby integrate distinct positive and negative signals, e.g., MINCLE and CLEC9A can trigger opposing signals through SYK or SHP-1.Signaling activity of C-type lectins (CTLs) in innate immune responses. CTLs expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages interact with different glycans, often expressed on pathogen-derived glycans. Activation of CTLs occurs through glycan binding, (more...)Among the myeloid CTLDs, CLEC-2 is expressed by NK cells, DCs, megakaryocytes, and platelets, but it is also expressed on some tumor cells. CLEC-2 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein whose signaling is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of a single tyrosine in the YXXL motif of its cytoplasmic domain. Signaling involves Src and Syk kinases and phospholipase Cγ2. CLEC-2 is also a receptor for the platelet-activating snake toxin rhodocytin, from the Malayan viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma.The major endogenous glycoprotein ligand for CLEC-2 is podoplanin (also called Aggrus), expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). CLEC-2 binds to the sialylated O-glycans and peptide portions of podoplanin. This is physiologically important and serves both as an alternative pathway for in vivo platelet activation, as well as fundamentally serving to drive lymphangiogenesis through the signaling functions of podoplanin. In the absence of extended O-glycans on podoplanin, as engineered in mice lacking C1GalT1 (T-synthase), due to loss of T-synthase or its chaperone Cosmc (C1GalT1C1), podoplanin is dysfunctional. This leads to defects in lymphangiogenesis, for lack of platelet involvement, a phenotype that closely phenocopies that seen in podoplanin-deficient mice. The CLEC-2-podoplanin pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cell motility and lymph node architecture and regulates inflammation notably during sepsis. Interestingly, different regions of the CTLD in CLEC-2 can bind the O-glycosylated podoplanin and the nonglycosylated rhodocytin.Another potential adhesion molecule is prolectin (CLEC17A), which is expressed in dividing B cells in germinal centers, and interacts with glycans containing terminal α-linked mannose or fucose residues. It may function within lymph nodes as an adhesion or colonization factor for invading tumor cells and shows preference for binding to epithelial rather than mesenchymal cells, which is relevant for tumor cells undergoing epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).Both macrophages and DCs are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that internalize antigens via specific endocytic receptors or by fluid-phase pinocytosis; they process antigens for presentation to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. DCs also contribute to the balance between tolerance and the induction of immunity and help to distinguish harmless “self-antigens” from pathogens. TLRs and CTLs (for myeloid cells, these have also been termed CTL receptors or CLRs) act to help DCs discriminate between pathogens and self-antigens. TLRs are PRRs that interact with PAMPs, but, unlike CLRs, TLRs cannot directly promote phagocytosis of bound ligands. A CLR can signal by itself, but can also interfere in signaling pathways induced by various other myeloid PRRs, such as TLRs, and hence can provide diverse immunological response outcomes. For example, mycobacteria interact with DCs via TLR-2 and TLR-4, resulting in strong T-helper 1 (Th1) responses by the activated DCs. However, some virulent strains of mycobacteria secrete glycosylated factors (e.g., mannosylated lipoarabinomannan or ManLAM) that are bound by CLRs, but apparently not by TLRs, which lead to down-regulation of TLR activation and limitation of DC maturation. DC-SIGN can tailor immune responses toward specific self and foreign structures in interaction with the signaling of other PRRs. The recognition of mannose-carrying PAMPs expressed by M. tuberculosis and HIV-1 activates the kinase Raf-1 to modulate TLR-induced NF-κB activation and enhance the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-12. In contrast, on recognition of fucose-carrying PAMPs being expressed by Schistosoma mansoni and Helicobacter pylori, DC-SIGN signaling leads to a suppression of the TLR-4-induced pro-inflammatory responses, abrogates Th1 and Th17 responses and favors a Th2 outcome. Recognition of pathogens through their glycans is important for protective immunity. In addition, glycans, when aberrantly expressed by cells in particular conditions, are now increasingly recognized as disease-driving factors in cancer, auto-immunity, and allergy. Therefore, myeloid CLRs represent important regulators in the balancing act between disease and homeostasis.The myeloid C-type lectins have important innate immune interactions with viruses, through binding to the glycans on viral glycoproteins. DC-SIGN was initially identified through its interactions with gp120 on the HIV envelope. Examples of viruses known to bind to C-type lectins in dendritic cells and macrophages include hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Nipah virus, Newcastle virus, and SARS coronaviruses. But almost all of the myeloid C-type lectins have been found to recognize viral glycoproteins. In particular, the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interacts with DC-SIGN, LSECtin, CLEC10A, and others and may contribute to immune hyperactivation.A seminal experiment in the mid-1960s by Gesner and Ginsburg showed that 32P-labeled rat lymphocytes injected back into rats homed to the spleen and lymph nodes, but when they were first treated with crude glycosidases homing was diminished. They hypothesized that “… sugars serve a physiological function by acting as sites of cellular interactions ….” This exceptional insight eventually introduced the concept that a GPB might be involved in lymphocyte homing, which eventually led to the discovery of L-selectin. Interestingly, we now know that altering the glycans on the lymphocytes by such treatments blocks their homing by reducing chemokine receptor functions and extravasation events required for lymphocyte homing.There are three members of the selectin family, P-, E-, and L-selectin, and they are among the best-characterized family of CTLs because of their extensively documented roles as cell adhesion molecules. They mediate (1) the earliest stages of leukocyte trafficking, (2) constitutive migration of lymphocytes to peripheral lymph nodes and to skin, and (3) hematopoietic stem cell trafficking to marrow. The three mammalian selectins are type-1 transmembrane glycoproteins that are expressed on platelets, endothelial cells, and leukocytes, hence the origin of their names (Figure 34.6A). Interactions between the selectins and cell-surface glycoconjugate ligands promote tethering and rolling of leukocytes and platelets in postcapillary venules and are important for leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation and injury. Rolling is a form of adhesion that requires rapid formation and dissociation of bonds between selectins and their ligands. Rolling adhesion enables leukocytes to encounter endothelium-bound chemokines. Signaling through chemokine receptors cooperates with signaling through selectin ligands to activate leukocyte integrins, which bind to immunoglobulin superfamily ligands on endothelial cells to slow rolling velocities and arrest leukocytes on vascular surfaces. The arrested leukocytes then crawl through or between endothelial cells into the underlying tissues (diapedesis or extravasation) (Figure 34.6D).Structures and functions of selectins. (A) Overall domain structures of P-selectin, E-selectin, and L-selectin and their expression patterns are indicated. P-selectin also forms homodimers in the membrane. (The key for the domain structures is shown in (more...)Each selectin has a C-type CRD at the amino terminus followed by a consensus epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and a number of short consensus repeats composed of sushi domains (also called complement control protein [CCP] modules) (Figure 34.6A). The proteins have a single transmembrane domain (TM) and a cytoplasmic domain and are relatively rigid, extended molecules. The CRD of each selectin has modest affinity for the sialylated, fucosylated structure known as the sialyl-Lewis x antigen (SLex) and its isomer sialyl-Lewis a (SLea) (Chapter 14) and increased binding to some sulfated versions of these motifs. Each of the selectins binds with higher affinity to specific macromolecular ligands, and most contain sialylated, fucosylated glycans. The major ligand for P-selectin, termed P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), has sulfated tyrosine residues adjacent to SLex expressed on a core-2-based O-glycan. This glycoform of PSGL-1 is also a high-affinity ligand for L-selectin, and additional PSGL-1 associated glycans also engage E-selectin. Although PSGL-1 is the major ligand for L- and P-selectin, E-selectin binds additional glycoconjugates also. Importantly, a major ligand for E-selectin is a glycoform of CD44 called “hematopoietic cell E/L-selectin ligand” (HCELL) that is constitutively expressed on human hematopoietic stem cells. This ligand carries SLex on its N-glycans. Murine leukocytes require core 1–derived O-glycans on CD44 and other glycoproteins to bind E-selectin. In addition to glycoproteins, P- and L-selectin, but not E-selectin, also binds to some forms of heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) in a divalent cation-independent manner. E-selectin is also reported to bind sialofucosylated glycolipids on human, but not murine, myeloid cells. Whereas the above glycoconjugates participate in myeloid leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation, the L-selectin ligands regulating lymphocytes homing to secondary lymphoid organs are distinct. These L-selectin ligands on endothelial cells of lymph node high endothelial venule (HEV) contain 6-sulfo-SLex determinants containing MECA-79 antigen on mucin-type O-glycans and on N-glycans.P-selectin (CD62P) was discovered as an antigen expressed on the surface of activated platelets. It is constitutively expressed in megakaryocytes, in which it is packaged into the membranes of α-granules of circulating platelets. It is also expressed in the Weibel–Palade bodies of vascular endothelial cells. Within minutes following activation of either platelets or endothelial cells by proinflammatory secretagogues such as histamine, thrombin, or complement components, P-selectin is expressed on the cell surface because of fusion of the intracellular storage membranes with the plasma membrane. Sequences within the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin mediate its sorting to secretory granules as well as its rapid endocytosis from the plasma membrane and movement from endosomes to lysosomes, where it is degraded. Splice variants of human P-selectin transcripts yield forms of P-selectin that lack a TM, thus contributing to low-level soluble forms of P-selectin in the circulation. Leukocyte adhesion also stimulates proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain of P-selectin from the plasma membrane, releasing it into the circulation. The inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 1β (IL1β), and LPS augment transcription of mRNA for P-selectin in endothelial cells in mice and non-primate mammals but not in humans.P-selectin contributes to leukocyte recruitment in both acute and chronic inflammation. Mice that lack P-selectin exhibit defective rolling of their leukocytes on endothelial cells of postcapillary venules, diminished recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes into tissues following injection of inflammatory mediators, and impaired recruitment of T cells into skin or other tissues following challenge with specific antigens. Mobilization of P-selectin to the surfaces of activated endothelial cells is important for all these responses. In addition, P-selectin expressed on the surfaces of activated platelets contributes to inflammation as well as to hemostasis and thrombosis. Activated platelets adhere through P-selectin to neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells, and some subsets of T lymphocytes. This adhesion augments the recruitment of leukocytes and platelets to sites of vascular injury. Expression of P-selectin on both platelets and endothelial cells contributes to experimental atherosclerosis in mice. Platelet-expressed P-selectin also stimulates monocytes to synthesize tissue factor, a key cofactor of blood coagulation that facilitates fibrin deposition during clot formation.As discussed below, although the major leukocyte counter receptor for P-selectin is PSGL-1, P-selectin (and L-selectin) also binds less avidly to some forms of heparin/HS and to some other glycoproteins that express SLex. Although the physiological significance of this non-PSGL-1-dependent binding by P-selectin is unclear, clinically prescribed levels of heparin can block P-selectin functions. In addition, P-selectin can interact with mucins containing highly clustered O-glycans bearing SLex antigens and sulfate esters, which appear to be important in the metastasis of tumors bearing such ligands (Chapter 47). The therapeutic effect of heparin in blocking cancer metastases may thus be mediated at least partly through blocking P- and/or L-selectin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes and platelets to tumor cells expressing SLex/a rich sulfated mucins. Results from a phase 2 trial suggest that a chemical selectin inhibitor (GMI-1070) may reduce the severity of vasoocclusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Another therapeutic approach targeting P-selectin is based on the blockade of human P-selectin with an inhibitory humanized antibody. This approach has shown efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of SCD. The antibody (crizanlizumab) is marketed as the drug Adakveo and is approved in the United States as a monthly medication to treat pain crisis in patients with SCD.PSGL-1 (CD162) is a homodimeric, disulfide-bonded mucin with subunits of ∼120 kDa. It is the major physiological ligand on leukocytes for P- and L-selectin and is also a ligand for E-selectin (Figure 34.6B). PSGL-1 contains 16 decapeptide repeating units (mucin repeats) with the consensus sequence spanning residues 118–277 in the ectodomain of the long form of the protein, which is the major form expressed in humans. Murine PSGL-1 has some sequence similarity to the human sequence, but the mouse protein has only 10 decameric repeats with the consensus sequence -E-T-S-Q/K-P-A-P-T/M-E-A-, which is different from human PSGL-1. The highest homology between human and murine PSGL-1 occurs in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and unexpectedly not in the P-selectin-binding domain.The PSGL-1 polypeptide is expressed in most leukocytes (including neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and subsets of T cells), and also on hematopoietic stem cells of mice and humans. Additionally, PSGL-1 is expressed in some activated endothelial cells, most notably the inflamed microvessels of the ileum in a spontaneous model of chronic ileitis in mice. In leukocytes, PSGL-1 is enriched in microvilli and is associated with lipid rafts.In neutrophils, monocytes, and activated T cells, PSGL-1 undergoes the appropriate posttranslational modifications to express the SLex structure on core 2 O-glycans (Figure 34.6C). This glycoform of PSGL-1 interacts with each of the three selectins to support leukocyte rolling under flow. Engagement of PSGL-1 during rolling also transduces signals into leukocytes that activate leukocyte integrins to slow rolling velocities. Signaling through PSGL-1 cooperates with signaling through chemokine receptors to elicit other effector responses in leukocytes.PSGL-1 has multiple functions in addition to being a selectin ligand. PSGL-1 is a check-point regulator in T cells, promotes T-cell exhaustion, and partly regulates the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression. PSGL-1 via its sulfated tyrosine residues can interact with certain chemokines, including CCL21 and CCL19, which may promote T-cell entry into secondary lymphoid organs. PSGL-1 is an adhesion molecule for pathogens, including enterovirus 71, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (the tick-transmitted obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and S. pneumonia. In some cases, as for A. phagocytophilum, the SLex-containing O-glycan of PSGL-1 is a recognition factor, whereas for the other pathogens, sulfated tyrosines are recognized.The key determinants for binding P-selectin are in the extreme amino terminus of PSGL-1. Antibodies to this region block binding of PSGL-1 to P- and L-selectin (but not to E-selectin, which may interact with other fucosylated sites on PSGL-1 and does not interact with sulfated tyrosines). Treatment of neutrophils with selective proteases that remove the first ten amino acids from the amino terminus of PSGL-1 abrogates its binding to P- and L-selectin. Site-directed mutagenesis of a specific O-glycosylated amino-terminal threonine and/or the three tyrosine residues in the amino terminus of PSGL-1 prevents binding to P- and L-selectin. Finally, a synthetic glycosulfopeptide (GSP) with the structure shown in Figure 34.6C binds to P-selectin with similar high affinity as that of native PSGL-1.The data support the model in Figure 34.6B in which the combination of tyrosine sulfate residues and a glycan on PSGL-1 are required for high-affinity binding to P-selectin. The cocrystal structure of a PSGL-1-derived GSP with P-selectin confirms this model. The interactions between the GSP and P-selectin result from a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts. These include contacts of at least two of the three tyrosine sulfate residues as well as other PSGL-1 amino acids with multiple residues within the P-selectin CRD, and hydroxyl groups in the fucose residue of SLex that ligate the lectin domain-bound Ca++, and there are additional binding interactions with the hydroxyl groups of galactose and the –COOH group of Neu5Ac.Key enzymes mediating the formation of the selectin-ligand on human PSGL-1 include core-1 synthase (T-synthase/C1GalT1) and it chaperone Cosmc (C1GalT1C1) that facilitate initial O-glycan biosynthesis; β1-6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (C2GnT-I) that facilitates core-2 structure formation; and the capping glycosyltransferases α2-3 sialyltransferases ST3Gal-4 and α1,3 fucosyltransferase FUT-VII that aid the formation of the functional SLex epitope. The enzymes mediating sulfation of the PSGL-1 peptide backbone on myeloid cells are likely PAPSS1 (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthase 1) and TPST2 (tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase).E-selectin (CD62E) was discovered as a leukocyte adhesion molecule expressed by activated vascular endothelial cells. In most tissues (the bone marrow and skin are exceptions), endothelial cells do not constitutively express E-selectin. Cytokine-dependent transcriptional processes lead to an inducible expression of E-selectin on the surface of the endothelium. Inducible transcription of the E-selectin locus by TNFα, IL1-β, and LPS is mediated at least in part through NF-κB-dependent events. In vitro, cytokine treatment increases E-selectin expression after two hours, with maximal expression at four hours. E-selectin expression then declines to basal levels within 12–24 hours in vitro, but may be expressed chronically at sites of inflammation in vivo. Decline of E-selectin expression is associated with decreased transcription of the E-selectin locus, degradation of E-selectin transcripts, and internalization and turnover of E-selectin protein. Acute and chronic inflammatory conditions associated with E-selectin expression include trauma, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and organ transplantation.E-selectin cooperates with P- and L-selectin to recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation. The physiological ligands for E-selectin contain the SLex antigen and occur on leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, memory/effector T cells, and NK cells) and on human hematopoietic stem cells. Each of the leukocyte subsets is found in acute and chronic inflammatory sites in association with the expression of E-selectin. PSGL-1 is one of the physiological ligands for E-selectin, but E-selectin can also interact with several other glycoproteins that express the SLex antigen on either N- or O-glycans, including HCELL (a human CD44 glycoform), E-selectin ligand-1 (in mice), and possibly long-chain glycosphingolipids expressing the SLex antigen. In this regard, whereas glycoprotein O- and N-glycans facilitate the initial recruitment and rapid rolling phase in the leukocyte adhesion cascade, sialofucosylated glycolipids may facilitate slow rolling and the transition to inflammatory leukocyte arrest. In human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), via adhesive interactions on bone medullary microvessels that constitutively express E-selectin, HCELL directs trafficking of HSCs into marrow. In addition to effects on leukocyte and hematopoietic stem cell migration, E-selectin receptor/ligand interactions may have a potential role in cancer metastasis, promoting malignant cell survival in bone marrow, and mesenchymal–epithelial transition in the bone marrow niche (Chapter 47).L-selectin (CD62L) is expressed on the microvilli of most leukocytes, including all myeloid cells, naïve T and B cells, and some memory/effector T cells. L-selectin was the first selectin discovered through efforts to define molecules that facilitate recirculation of lymphoid cells from the intravascular compartment to secondary lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes and Peyer\\'s patches, from which the lymphoid cells then return to the circulation through the lymphatic system, as discussed above in work by Gesner and Ginsburg. This recirculation process provides lymphocytes with the opportunity to encounter foreign antigens displayed by APCs within secondary lymphoid organs. Early studies indicated that blood lymphocytes enter lymph nodes in specialized postcapillary HEVs. Endothelial cells in the HEV are cuboid in shape. Their surfaces are decorated with different types of small-sized mucins that mediate L-selectin-dependent adhesion of lymphocytes. These mucins are called peripheral node addressins. They include CD34, Sgp200, GlyCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, endoglycan, endomucin, and podocalyxin-like protein (PCLP). On cellular activation and migration L-selectin is proteolytically shed from the surface of activated leukocytes by a metalloproteinase TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17).Rolling mediated by L-selectin exhibits a counterintuitive “shear threshold” requirement (e.g., a minimum flow rate is required for leukocytes to roll). As the flow rate drops below this threshold, leukocytes roll faster and more unstably and then detach. Flow-enhanced rolling operates through a force-dependent mechanism. As the flow rate increases, the force applied to adhesive bonds between L-selectin and its ligands increases. At threshold levels, the force actually strengthens the bonds, which prolongs their lifetimes. These are called “catch bonds.” As the flow rate increases further, the applied force begins to weaken the bonds, which shortens their lifetimes. These are called “slip bonds.” Catch bonds are regulated by force-dependent straightening of the angle between the lectin and EGF domains of L-selectin, which affects how ligand dissociates from the binding interface on the lectin domain. Transitions between catch and slip bonds are also seen for interactions of P-selectin and E-selectin with their ligands. However, these transitions occur at lower forces with less dramatic effects in the circulation.A unique feature of the L-selectin ligands on HEV is the requirement for sulfated glycans, such as 6-sulfo-SLex on both core-2 O-glycans and on extended core-1 O-glycans. The 6-sulfo-SLex determinant is associated with the MECA-79 epitope on O-glycans (Figure 34.6), an antibody that binds to 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine on extended core-1 O-glycans. The biosynthesis of the 6-sulfo-SLex determinant depends on two key α1-3 fucosyltransferases, Fuct-VII and Fuct-IV, along with at least four different sulfotransferases that may form the 6-sulfo-SLex determinant. Two of these sulfotransferases, GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2, are expressed in HEV and appear to be most important. Mice lacking Fuct-VII or both Fuct-VII and Fuct-IV have dramatically reduced homing of lymphocytes to lymph nodes. Mice lacking both GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 do not express 6-sulfo-SLex or the MECA-79 epitope and exhibit markedly diminished lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes. A unique β1-3GlcNAcT generates the extended core-1 O-glycan; mice lacking both this β1-3GlcNAcT and the β1-6GlcNAcT branching enzyme for core-2 O-glycan biosynthesis do not express the MECA-79 antigen, but they have residual lymphocyte rolling on HEV and only a minimal decrease in lymphocyte numbers in peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes. The residual L-selectin-dependent lymphocyte homing appears to result from 6-sulfo-SLex on N-glycans, suggesting that both N- and O-glycans on HEV glycoproteins contribute to L-selectin-dependent lymphocyte recirculation through lymph nodes. On the lymphocyte itself, the sialylated core-1-derived O-glycans on surface glycoproteins, including chemokine receptors, are crucial to migration of lymphocytes into lymph nodes. Cosmc-deficient murine B cells or desialylated cells are unable to home to lymph nodes, thus providing a physiological mechanism for the observations of Gesner and Ginsburg on the block to homing by enzymatic deglycosylation of lymphocytes.L-selectin also plays a role in adhesion of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes to nonlymphoid vascular endothelium (Figure 34.6). The major ligand for L-selectin in these inflammatory settings is PSGL-1, which is expressed on adherent leukocytes and may also be deposited on inflamed endothelial cells as fragments left behind by previously rolling leukocytes. An alternate ligand on endothelial cells is HS. As with P-selectin, clinically relevant doses of the drug heparin can block L-selectin, and likely contributes to the inhibition of tumor metastasis and of mucinous-tumor associated hypercoagulability (Trousseau\\'s syndrome) (Chapter 47). On human hematopoietic stem cells, HCELL is also a potent L-selectin ligand, yet unlike all other naturally-expressed L-selectin ligands, its binding to L-selectin is not sulfate-dependent. Mice lacking L-selectin have defects in neutrophil recruitment in the context of inflammation as well as defects in homing of naïve lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs.The CTLD occurs in several proteoglycans (lecticans or hyalectins) that lack TMs and reside in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (group I; Figure 34.3). These include aggrecan, brevican, versican, and neurocan. Like the selectins, each of these core proteins contains a CTLD, an EGF-like domain, and a CCP domain, but their domain order is different and they are located in the carboxyl terminus of the protein. A large region containing attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS) is proximal to the lectin domain. A more complete discussion of the proteoglycans is provided in Chapter 17. The exact functions of the CTLD in these proteins are still unknown. The CTLD of rat aggrecan is important for Ca++-dependent binding to the fibronectin type II repeats 3–5 of rat tenascin-R. The CTLDs in other lecticans are probably also responsible for protein–protein interactions with other receptors, including tenascin-R, tenascin-C, and other tenascins, which are ECM glycoproteins highly expressed in the nervous system. Interestingly, the protein–protein interactions between rat fibronectin and the CTLD of rat aggrecan bear resemblance to the protein–protein interactions seen in P-selectin binding to PSGL-1. Tenascin-R is one of the main carriers of the unusual glycan antigen HNK-1, which was named after its identification on human NK cells. Brevican, a lectican found in the nervous system, binds to the HNK-1-containing glycosphingolipids. Thus, the CTLD in lecticans may represent a versatile structural feature that can be used for both protein–protein and protein–glycan interactions. Interestingly, several aggrecanopathies (inherited defects in aggrecan production/function) are associated with mutations in the exon encoding the CTLD domain of aggrecan.A number of proteins with CTLDs have been identified in the pancreas and kidney, but whether these proteins bind glycans is unclear. PKD1, one of two ADPKD gene products associated with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), has been implicated in cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions. The PKD1 gene encodes polycystin-1 (PC1), a very large protein (4293 amino acids) with a single CTLD near its amino terminus. Carboxy-terminal proteolysis of PC1 during its secretion releases a cytoplasmic portion that becomes nuclear and regulates cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, the CTLD of PC1 appears to bind collagen in a Ca++-dependent fashion that is inhibitable by sugars, including dextrans, but the precise nature of the interaction is still unclear.Some small proteins with CTLDs include Reg3α and PSP (pancreatic stone protein), which are in the REG group 7 of CTLs, and are essentially isolated CTLDs that are preceded by a signal sequence. Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore.Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution.The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.35Takashi Angata, Stephan von Gunten, Ronald L. Schnaar, and Ajit Varki.I-type lectins are defined as glycan-binding proteins (excluding antibodies and T-cell receptors) in which the binding domain is homologous to the large and varied immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) of proteins. Among I-type lectins, the Siglec family of sialic acid–recognizing lectins is the best characterized subgroup, both structurally and functionally, and is therefore the major focus of this chapter. Details of their discovery, characterization, binding properties, and biology are provided, along with discussions of their functional roles in vertebrate biology, with most currently available information being in mammals, and multiple unusual changes during human evolution.The Ig fold is made up of antiparallel β-strands organized into a β-sandwich containing 100–120 amino acids and usually stabilized by an intersheet disulfide bond. Three types or “sets” of Ig domains are defined based on homologies in sequence and structure to domains of antibodies: the V-set variable-like domain, the C1- and C2-set constant-like domains, and the I-set domain that combines features of both V- and C-set domains.Before the 1990s, it was thought that antibodies were the only IgSF members capable of recognizing glycans. The first direct evidence for nonantibody IgSF glycan-binding proteins came from independent studies on sialoadhesin (Sn), a sialic acid (Sia)–dependent binding receptor on mouse macrophage subsets, and on CD22, a molecule previously cloned as a B-cell marker. Various techniques showed that Sn functions as a lectin, including loss of binding following sialidase treatment of ligands, inhibition assays with sialylated compounds, and Sia-dependent binding of the purified receptor to glycoproteins and to red blood cells derivatized to carry Sias in different linkages. With recombinant CD22, abrogation of cell adhesive interactions by sialidase treatment led to the discovery that it was a Sia-binding lectin, with a high degree of specificity for α2-6-linked Sias. Cloning of Sn then showed that it was an IgSF member sharing homology with CD22 and with two other previously cloned proteins, CD33 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Demonstration of Sia recognition by CD33 and MAG resulted in the definition of a new family of Sia-binding molecules, which were initially called “sialoadhesins.” Meanwhile, preliminary evidence for glycan binding by additional IgSF members emerged, and a suggestion was made to classify all these molecules as “I-type” lectins. However, it became clear that these four Sia-binding molecules were a distinct subgroup sharing both sequence homology and Ig-domain organization, and that they were not all involved in adhesion. The term Siglec (sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) was therefore proposed in 1998. Subsequently, most of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) were discovered as a result of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing projects, which allowed in silico identification of novel Siglec-related genes and cDNAs.Siglecs are divided into two major subgroups based on sequence similarity (Figure 35.1) and on conservation among mammalian species. The first group comprises Sn (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), MAG (Siglec-4), and Siglec-15, for which there are clear-cut orthologs in all mammalian species examined and which share only ∼25%–30% sequence identity among each other. The second group comprises the CD33rSiglecs, which share ∼50%–80% sequence similarity but appear to be evolving rapidly and undergoing exon shuffling and gene conversions of Ig-domain-encoding exons, making it difficult to define orthologs, even between rodents and primates (see below). For this reason, Siglec nomenclature uses numbers and letters to differentiate between some nonhomologous human and mouse Siglecs. In retrospect, it turned out that many distantly related mammals have more clear-cut orthologs, and it is the rodent lineage that “discarded” these genes.Domain structures of the known Siglecs in humans and mice. There are two subgroups of Siglecs: One group contains sialoadhesin (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), MAG (Siglec-4), and Siglec-15, and the other group contains CD33-related Siglecs. In humans, Siglec-12 (more...)Several IgSF members other than Siglecs have been proposed to bind glycans or glycoconjugates. The best evidence is for paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptors (PILR-α and PILR-β), both of which have a single V-set domain similar to that of Siglecs with a structurally defined Sia-binding site as well as a protein interaction site. PILR proteins bind a subset of mucin-like O-glycosylated membrane proteins involving simultaneous recognition of both the peptide backbone and Sia to mediate high-affinity interactions. Evidence suggests a role of PILRs in the control of innate immunity and host defense against microbial pathogens. PILRs are expressed on immune cells of the myeloid lineage, and PILR-β is also found on NK cells. PILR-α contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and delivers inhibitory signals by recruitment of inhibitory phosphatases. In contrast, PILR-β associates with DNAX activation protein-12 (DAP12), an adapter protein that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM) and promotes innate immune cell activation. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 is composed of six extracellular Ig-like domains and selectively recognizes α2-6-linked Sia. PECAM-1 is broadly expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes and plays multiple roles linked to leukocyte transendothelial migration, inflammation, and vascular biology. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and basigin (CD147) have been claimed to recognize and bind oligomannose-type N-glycans on adjacent glycoproteins in the nervous system. NCAM contains five Ig-like domains followed by two fibronectin type III-like domains, and exerts essential functions in the development, plasticity, and regeneration of the nervous system. The different isoforms of basigin contain variable numbers of Ig-like domains and are widely expressed in different tissues where they have roles in reproduction, nervous system function, and immunity. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 comprises five Ig-like domains and binds numerous ligands, including the integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1, hyaluronan and possibly certain mucin-type glycoproteins. Its expression on leukocytes and endothelial cells is enhanced on cellular activation. ICAM-1 plays crucial roles in cell–cell interactions, extravasation, inflammation, and host defense. Hemolin is an IgSF plasma protein from lepidopteran insects that binds lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria. Hemolin appears to have two binding sites for LPS—one that interacts with the phosphate groups of lipid A and another that interacts with the O-specific glycan antigen and the outer-core glycans of LPS. There is indirect and less convincing evidence for interactions of other IgSF molecules with glycans, such as the peripheral myelin protein P0 with HNK-1, CD83 with Sias, and CD2 with Lewis x (Lex). Overall, with the exception of the Siglecs and the PILRs, the direct assignment of an IgSF fold as the actual binding pocket for glycans has not been achieved. The rest of this chapter is devoted to Siglecs, the best-characterized I-type lectins.All Siglecs are type-1 membrane proteins with a Sia-binding, amino-terminal V-set domain and varying numbers of C-set Ig domains that act as spacers, projecting the Sia-binding site away from the plasma membrane. The V-set domain and the adjacent C-set domain contain a small number of invariant amino acid residues, including an “essential” arginine on the F β-strand required for Sia binding, and an unusual organization of cysteine residues. Instead of the typical intersheet disulfide bond between the B and F β-strands, the V-set domain of Siglecs displays an intrasheet disulfide bond between the B and E β-strands, permitting increased separation between the β-sheets. The resulting exposure of hydrophobic residues allows specific interactions with constituents of Sia ligands. All Siglecs studied so far also appear to contain an additional unusual disulfide bond between the V-set domain and the adjacent C-set domain, which would be expected to promote tight packing at the interface between the first two Ig domains. Although the significance of this bond for ligand recognition is unclear, optimal Sia-binding activity of many Siglecs requires the adjacent C-set domain, probably for correct folding and stability.Three-dimensional structures for the mouse Sn, human Siglec-7, and human CD33 V-set domains, the V-set and adjacent C-set domain of Siglec-5, first three Ig-like domains of human CD22, and all five Ig-like domains of mouse MAG have been determined by X-ray crystallography, in the presence and absence of Sia ligands (Figure 35.2). Along with the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of Siglec-8, structural templates for Sia recognition by Siglecs appear to be shared among Siglecs. In all instances, an “essential” arginine residue is located in the middle of the F β-strand, making a bidentate salt bridge with the carboxylate of Sia. Siglecs also contain conserved hydrophobic amino acids on the A and G β-strands that interact with the N-acetyl group and glycerol side chain of Sia, respectively. Although all Siglecs appear to use a common template for recognizing Sias, their binding preferences for extended glycan chains vary greatly. The peptide loop between the C and C′ β-strands is highly variable among Siglecs and has a key role in determining their fine sugar specificity. For example, molecular grafting of the C–C′ loop between Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 resulted in switched sugar-binding specificities. Structural studies have shown that this loop appears to be highly flexible, being able to make specific and varied interactions with long glycan chains. In addition, V-set domain sequences are the most rapidly evolving regions in these molecules, likely explaining species differences in binding specificity.Structural basis of Siglec binding to ligands. X-ray crystal structures of the V-set domains of sialoadhesin (Sn) (A) and Siglec-7 (B) are shown complexed with sialic acid. (C,D) Molecular details of the interactions of sialic acid with Sn and Siglec-7. (more...)The cell-surface glycocalyx of most vertebrate cells is richly decorated in glycoconjugates that contain Sias (Chapter 15). The high local concentration of Sias is likely to greatly exceed the Kd value of each Siglec, resulting in self-binding to sialoglycans on the same membrane (cis) that can be directly functional or that can “mask” the Sia-binding site from interacting with sialoglycans on other cells (trans). Consequently, the Sia-dependent binding activity of most naturally expressed Siglecs is strongly enhanced following treatment of cells with sialidase to eliminate the cis-interacting sialylated glycans. A notable exception is Sn, which was discovered via its native property as a Sia-dependent cell-adhesion molecule on macrophages. The “masked” state of most Siglecs is a dynamic equilibrium with multiple cis ligands. Thus, an external probe, a cell surface or a pathogen bearing high-affinity ligands or very high densities of Sia residues, can effectively compete for binding to “masked” Siglecs. In addition, changes in expression of glycosyltransferases or sialidases of endogenous or exogenous origin could influence masking and unmasking of Siglecs at the cell surface, especially during immune and inflammatory responses.Siglecs show restricted patterns of expression in single or related cell types (see below). This is most striking for the conserved Siglecs—Sn (macrophage), CD22 (B lymphocyte), MAG (myelin-forming cell), and Siglec-15 (osteoclast). This theme extends to some of the CD33rSiglecs, most notably in humans, including Siglec-6 on placental trophoblasts, Siglec-7 on NK (natural killer) cells, and Siglec-11 and -16 on tissue macrophages, including brain microglia in humans. In the mouse, Siglec-H and CD33 are excellent markers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) and blood neutrophils, respectively, and Siglec-F is a useful marker of eosinophils and alveolar macrophages. These cell type–restricted expression patterns are thought to reflect discrete, cell-specific functions mediated by each of these Siglecs. However, certain key cells of the human immune system, such as monocytes and conventional DCs, express multiple CD33rSiglecs.Most Siglecs have one or more tyrosine-based signaling motifs in their cytoplasmic tails or associate with membrane adaptor proteins containing cytosolic tyrosine motifs. The most prevalent motif is the ITIM with the consensus sequence (V/I/L)XYXX(L/V), where X is any amino acid. Up to 300 ITIM-containing membrane proteins are identified in the human genome, and many of these are established inhibitory receptors of the hematopoietic and immune systems. Following tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, they function by recruiting and activating SH2-domain-containing effectors, especially the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. These counteract activating signals triggered by receptors containing ITAMs. Some Siglecs, notably Siglecs-14, -15, -16, and -H and mouse CD33, have a positively charged residue within the transmembrane region, which can associate with the DAP12 ITAM-containing adaptor, thereby mediating activating functions.Sn (CD169) was identified as a Sia-dependent sheep erythrocyte receptor expressed by mouse stromal macrophages. Sn has an unusually large number of Ig domains (seventeen), which are conserved among mammals and reptiles. These may be important for extending the Sia-binding site away from the plasma membrane to promote intercellular interactions. Sn prefers α2-3-linked Sias more than α2-6- and α2-8-linked Sias, and does not bind Sias modified by hydroxylation (Neu5Gc) or side-chain O-acetylation (e.g., Neu5,9Ac2). Notably, this preference is very similar to the pattern of Sias expressed on commensal/pathogenic microbes (Neu5Ac>>Neu5Gc and α2-3>α2-8>>>α2-6).In humans and mice, Sn expression appears specific for macrophage subsets, especially those resident in lymphoid tissues. These cells play important roles in antigen presentation to B cells and NKT cells, tolerance of self-reactive T cells but also as Trojan horses for viral infections to permit protective immune responses. Sn can also be strongly induced on monocytes, macrophages, and monocyte-derived DCs in vitro by type I interferons or agents such as viruses and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands that induce interferon production. Accordingly, Sn is up-regulated on circulating monocytes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and on macrophages in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sn expression on inflammatory macrophages has been associated with a favorable prognosis in colorectal cancer and with more severe disease in proliferative glomerulonephritis. Many of the above disease associations may reflect exposure of macrophages to interferons rather than being causally related. Indeed, in the BWF1 murine model of spontaneous SLE, there was no influence of Sn deficiency on disease severity. However, in mouse models of inherited neuropathy, autoimmune uveoretinitis, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), Sn-deficient mice showed reduced inflammation accompanied by reduced levels of T-cell and macrophage activation. These results suggest that Sn may suppress regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion thereby promoting inflammation. Sn can also efficiently mediate the capture and uptake of exosomes released from B lymphocytes following apoptosis and therefore play a role in antigen presentation.A role for Sn in phagocytic interactions of macrophages with various sialylated bacteria and protozoal pathogens has also been shown, including Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Trypanosoma cruzi. A role in host protection was observed using an infection model with Group B streptococcus (GBS), in which Sn-deficient mice showed increased bacterial spread. Conversely, Sn expression on macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs can be exploited by enveloped viruses displaying host-derived Sias, leading to their capture, uptake, and dissemination. This mechanism was first seen with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, which targets lung alveolar macrophages of pigs, and more recently with HIV and other retroviruses. On HIV, Sn can recognize both sialylated gp120 glycoprotein and GM3, a monosialylated ganglioside terminating in Neu5Acα2-3Gal. GM3 is packaged into HIV during the budding from infected cells which occurs in lipid rafts. On monocyte-derived DCs, Sn interactions with GM3 on HIV lead to membrane invaginations containing viral particles that are very efficiently transferred to T cells in a process known as “trans infection.”CD22 is a developmentally regulated cell-surface glycoprotein on B cells, expressed at approximately the time of Ig gene rearrangement and lost when mature B cells differentiate into plasma cells. CD22 has seven Ig-like domains and the intracellular region has six tyrosine-based signaling motifs, three of which could function as ITIMs. CD22 is a well-established negative regulator of B-cell activation, making an important contribution toward the threshold for signaling via the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex. Following BCR cross-linking, CD22 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated on its ITIMs by the protein tyrosine kinase Lyn. This leads to recruitment and activation of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase and subsequent inhibition of downstream signaling mediated via the BCR. Although some activating molecules are also recruited to the phosphorylated tyrosine motifs in CD22, the net phenotype of CD22-deficient mice is consistent with a primary role of CD22 in negative regulatory signaling, manifested by enhanced BCR-induced calcium signaling, enhanced B-cell turnover, reduced numbers of recirculating B cells in the bone marrow, and reduced numbers of marginal zone B cells.Of all the Siglecs, CD22 has the most conserved specificity for sialylated ligands, binding primarily to α2-6-linked Sias of the type Neu5Ac(or Neu5Gc)α2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc, which are common capping structures of many complex-type N-glycans. Additional specificity can be conferred by the nature of the Sia moiety as well as sulfation of the underlying glycan. Neither human nor mouse CD22 binds 9-O-acetylated Sias; mouse CD22 has a strong preference for Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac, whereas human CD22 binds both of the latter forms. Recombinant soluble CD22 can precipitate a subset of glycoproteins from B-cell lysates including CD45, a major sialoprotein of T and B cells. However, on B cells, CD22 appears to mainly be either cis-associated with other CD22 molecules in a glycan-dependent manner, or with the BCR, which it inhibits in a glycan-independent manner. These interactions are consistent with studies of mouse mutants that either lack CD22 glycan ligands or express mutated forms of CD22 unable to bind glycans. B cells from ST6Gal-I-deficient mice that lack CD22 ligands show an anergic phenotype, essentially the opposite of the phenotype observed in CD22-deficient mice. Mice expressing a lectin-inactive version of CD22 with a mutated binding site arginine also show reduced BCR signaling (anergy) and, similar to ST6Gal-I-deficient mice, they show increased CD22-BCR association and stronger CD22 phosphorylation (Figure 35.3). Likewise, Cmah-null mice deficient in Neu5Gc have reduced ligands for mouse CD22 and Siglec-G (see below) and show B cell hyperactivity.Proposed biological functions mediated by CD22. CD22 glycan-dependent homotypic interactions in equilibrium with CD22–BCR interactions. CD22 is clustered together by Sia-dependent homotypic interaction and kept away from BCR on wild-type B cells, (more...)Besides regulating B-cell functions via cis-interactions, CD22 can also mediate trans-interactions with sialylated ligands on other cells that sequester CD22 away from the BCR. This could be important for raising B-cell activation thresholds to “self”-antigens and may help to ensure that signaling through the BCR can only occur in lymphoid tissues in which CD22 α2-6-sialylated ligands are abundant. Although CD22-deficiency alone does not lead to extensive autoimmune reactions, mice deficient in both CD22 and the other major B-cell Siglec, Siglec-G, develop SLE-like symptoms, including production of IgG autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis.The restricted expression and properties of CD22 make it an attractive therapeutic target. Antibody-based CD22-targeting agents, such as antibody–drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin and recombinant antibody–toxin fusion protein moxetumomab pasudotox, have been approved for clinical use (for acute B-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, respectively).MAG, a minor constituent of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin, has five Ig-like domains and is well conserved among vertebrates. It is expressed by myelin-forming cells: oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS. In mature myelinated axons it is found primarily on the innermost (periaxonal) myelin wrap, directly across from the axon, but not in the multilayers of compacted myelin. MAG-deficient mice develop normal myelin, but defects in myelin and axons increase as animals age, indicating a role for MAG in the maintenance of myelinated axons, rather than in the process of myelination. MAG-null mice display late-onset axonal degeneration leading to progressive loss of motor function. MAG-null mice fail to show characteristic myelin-induced increases in neurofilament phosphorylation and therefore reduced axon diameters, indicating that MAG signaling is required for optimal myelin–axon interactions. Mendelian disorders (autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 75) caused by homozygous mutation in the MAG gene, including a point mutation in its Sia-binding arginine, have been reported, and clinical features of the disease are consistent with the roles of MAG revealed by the studies of Mag-deficient mice. MAG also directly inhibits neurite outgrowth from a wide variety of neuronal cell types in vitro. This contributes to the inhibitory activity of myelin on axon outgrowth after nervous system injury, hampering functional recovery.Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that gangliosides (sialylated glycolipids) are important physiological ligands for MAG, mediating both myelin–axon stability and inhibition of axon outgrowth. Recombinant forms of MAG bind selectively to the abundant axonal gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (Chapter 11). The phenotype of MAG-deficient mice is similar to that of mice lacking an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (coded by the B4galnt1 gene) required for synthesis of GD1a and GT1b, resulting in progressive motor dysfunction. Notably, human mutations in the same gene (B4GALNT1) result in hereditary spastic paraplegia, a progressive motor neuropathy reminiscent of that of B4galnt1-null mice. Binding of soluble MAG to some types of neurons, and subsequent MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth, is Sia and ganglioside dependent. MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth from B4galnt1-null mouse neurons is diminished, whereas MAG still inhibits neurite outgrowth from the neurons of mice lacking the “b-series” gangliosides (GD3 synthase-null; Chapter 11), which lack GT1b but express GD1a. These findings suggest that gangliosides GD1a or GT1b act as functional docking sites for MAG on neuronal cells. MAG binds to other axonal receptors including a family of GPI-anchored proteins (Nogo receptors NgR1 and NgR2) and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB). Gangliosides, NgRs, and PirB may act independently or interactively as MAG receptors, linking MAG binding to axonal signaling in different neuronal cell types.Siglec-15 was first described as a highly conserved ancient Siglec in vertebrates. It lacks the typical arrangement of cysteines seen in the V-set Ig domain of other Siglecs and has an unusual intron–exon arrangement. Nevertheless, it can bind the Sialyl-Tn structure (Neu5Acα2-6GalNAcα) and other structures containing a Neu5Acα2-6HexNAc determinant. It associates with DAP12 but also has an ITIM-like motif in its cytoplasmic tail. Although first reported on macrophages and DCs in human lymphoid tissues, Siglec-15 is most strongly expressed in osteoclasts and their precursors in which it plays an important role, together with receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (RANK), in triggering osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclasts are key cells involved in bone degradation and share a common hemopoietic progenitor with macrophages. Mice lacking Siglec-15 show a mild osteopetrosis and impaired osteoclast differentiation. Specific antibodies against Siglec-15 phenocopy this state, because of antibody-induced internalization and degradation of Siglec-15. In addition, Siglec-15 is expressed in some tumor tissues (tumor-associated macrophages and cancer cells), and an antibody against Siglec-15 was shown to suppress the growth of a mouse melanoma in vivo. Siglec-15 therefore provides a novel target for diseases, such as menopause-related osteoporosis and cancer.Genes encoding most of the CD33rSiglec subfamily are clustered on human chromosome 19q13.3-13.4 or the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7. They include CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglecs-5 through -12, Siglec-14, and Siglec-16 in humans and CD33 and Siglecs-E, -F, -G, and -H in mice. Similar clusters are found in other mammals. It is difficult to assign all definitive orthologs between primates and rodents, resulting in different nomenclatures. One reason is that most IgSF domains are encoded by exons with phase-1 splice junctions, allowing exon shuffling without disrupting open reading frames, resulting in hybrid genes that are difficult to distinguish from similarly organized genes in other species. A second reason is that the Sia-binding V-set domains of the CD33rSiglecs are rapidly evolving, presumably to adjust their binding specificity to the rapid evolution of the endogenous host sialome, as well as evasion of binding by pathogens via molecular mimicry (Chapter 15) or specific protein-mediated interactions (see below). There are also multiple gene conversion events between adjacent genes and pseudogenes within this cluster. Of interest is the finding that humans show many CD33rSiglec differences compared with our closest evolutionary cousins (the chimpanzees), more than the differences between mice and rats, which shared a common ancestor much earlier (see below).As mentioned earlier, an “essential” arginine residue in all known Siglecs is required for binding Sia-containing ligands. This residue is often mutated in nature, resulting in loss of binding ability. Examples include Siglec-12 in humans, Siglecs-5 and -14 in the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, Siglec-6 in the baboon, and Siglec-H in the rat. The common arginine codon (CGN, where N is any nucleotide) tends to be highly mutable because of the CpG sequence (which is prone to TpG or CpA transition via cytosine methylation–deamination). However, the frequency with which such events occur suggests that it might be a natural mechanism to eliminate Sia binding of a given Siglec, when such activity becomes inappropriate under changing evolutionary pressures, without causing a complete loss of the Siglec. Overall, it appears that this class of SIGLEC genes is subject to multiple “Red Queen” effects in evolution, in which evolutionary changes of sialyltransferases in response to the emergence of Sia-binding pathogens may lead to subsequent evolutionary changes of Siglec specificities (Figure 35.4).Probable evolutionary chain of Red Queen effects involving Sias and CD33rSiglecs. See text for discussion. (Redrawn, with permission, from Padler-Karavani V, et al. 2014. FASEB J28: 1280–1293.) To limit further complexity, two additional Red (more...)Below, we provide a brief summary of the main features of the human CD33rSiglecs and, where relevant, their murine counterparts.CD33 is a marker of early human myeloid progenitors and leukemic cells and is also expressed on monocytes and tissue macrophages, including brain microglia. It has two Ig domains and was the first of the CD33rSiglecs to be characterized as an inhibitory receptor, suppressing activation of FcγRI and recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Figure 35.5). CD33 has some preference for α2-6- rather than α2-3-sialylated glycans and binds strongly to sialylated ligands on myeloid leukemia cell lines. The restricted expression of CD33 has been exploited in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia using gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody coupled to the toxic antibiotic calicheamicin. Binding of anti-CD33 mAbs to CD33 triggers endocytosis of the bound antibody. This depends on ITIM phosphorylation, recruitment of the E3 ligase Cbl, and ubiquitylation of the CD33 cytoplasmic tail. Selective expression of CD33 on leukemic progenitor cells also makes it an attractive target for therapy using chimeric antigen receptors expressed on cytotoxic T cells.Proposed biological functions mediated by CD33-related Siglecs. A generic CD33-related Siglec is represented, showing the location of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the potential for inhibitory signaling. Recently, two coinherited single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with protection of humans against late-onset Alzheimer\\'s disease. These SNPs result in increased exon 2 skipping, leading to raised levels of CD33 lacking the V-set domain and reduced levels of full-length CD33. Because full-length CD33 can inhibit microglial cell uptake of Aβ protein in a Sia-dependent manner, it is thought that individuals lacking the protective SNPs may accumulate more toxic Aβ proteins, thus driving Alzheimer\\'s disease pathology. Targeting CD33 using antibodies that either inhibit function or promote internalization and degradation may be a useful approach to Alzheimer\\'s disease. A complexity arises because the truncated form of CD33 appears to be retained intracellularly in peroxisomes, and the biological consequence of this diversion is currently uncertain.The murine ortholog of CD33 exists as two spliced forms that differ in the cytoplasmic region, neither containing the typical ITIM found in most other CD33rSiglecs. Furthermore, mouse CD33 has a lysine residue in the transmembrane sequence and couples to the DAP12 transmembrane adaptor, as shown for mouse Siglec-H and human Siglecs-14, -15, and -16. In contrast to human CD33, mouse CD33 in the blood is expressed mainly on neutrophils rather than monocytes, and at low levels in microglia, which also suggests a nonconserved function of this receptor.The SIGLEC5 and SIGLEC14 genes are adjacent to each other on chromosome 19 and encode proteins containing four and three Ig-like domains, respectively. Because of ongoing gene conversions within most taxa, the first two Ig domains of Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 share >99% sequence identity but then diverge, with Siglec-5 being an inhibitory receptor with typical ITIMs, whereas Siglec-14 can complex with DAP12 and activate signaling. Both Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 bind similar ligands, with some preference for the sialyl-Tn structure (Neu5Acα2-6GalNAcα) and α2-8-linked Sias. Although many antibodies to Siglec-5 cross-react with Siglec-14, specific antibodies revealed that although Siglec-5 is expressed on neutrophils and B cells, Siglec-14 is found on neutrophils and monocytes. A SIGLEC14-null allele is frequently present in Asian populations but is less common in Europeans. The null allele arose from a recombination event between the 5′ region of the SIGLEC14 gene and the nearby 3′ region of the SIGLEC5 gene, resulting in a fusion protein almost identical to Siglec-5 but expressed in a Siglec-14-like manner. Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are also SIGLEC14-null showed reduced exacerbation attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms) compared with individuals expressing Siglec-14. Both Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 can bind sialylated strains of Haemophilus influenzae implicated in COPD exacerbations and trigger inhibition and activation responses, respectively. Thus, the absence of Siglec-14 on neutrophils would lead to reduced inflammatory responses in SIGLEC14-null individuals with the added impact of inhibitory Siglec-5 on monocytes. Besides expression on leukocytes, both Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 are found on human amniotic epithelium and may mediate dualistic responses to GBS infection and the frequency of preterm births in infected mothers. There are no obvious equivalents of Siglec-5 or Siglec-14 in mice, making it difficult to study this interesting pair of receptors in vivo.Siglec-6 was cloned from a human placental cDNA library and was also independently identified during a screen for proteins that bind leptin, a hormone that regulates body weight. It has three Ig-like domains and the typical arrangement of ITIM and ITIM-like motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. Low levels of Siglec-6 are expressed on B cells, but high expression is seen in the placental cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in humans. Siglec-6 levels are increased in preterm deliveries associated with preeclampsia, but it is not yet known if there is a causal relationship. The heavily sialylated protein glycodelin is produced in the uterus and appears to bind Siglec-6 on cytotrophoblasts and to suppress their migration into decidua through inhibition of ERK and c-Jun signaling. A SNP in SIGLEC6 is associated with SLE in Asians. Siglec-6 does not have an obvious ortholog in mice, but one is present in the chimpanzee and baboon. However, placental expression appears unique to humans.Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 share a high degree of sequence similarity and appear to have evolved by gene duplication from an ancestral gene encoding a 3-Ig-domain inhibitory Siglec, represented in mice by Siglec-E. Siglec-7 is the major Siglec on human NK cells and is also seen at lower levels on monocytes, macrophages, DCs, and minor subsets of CD8 T cells. Disease-associated changes in expression patterns and levels of these Siglecs have been reported. Siglec-7 has also been detected in platelets, basophils, and mast cells in which it may modulate survival and activation. Siglec-9 is prominently expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and DCs, ∼30% of NK cells, and minor subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Based on glycan array binding experiments (Chapter 29), Siglec-7 binds strongly to α2-8-linked Sias present in “b-series” gangliosides (Chapter 11) and some glycoproteins, whereas Siglec-9 prefers α2-3-linked Sias. Sulfation of the sialyl-Lex (SLex) structure can strongly influence recognition by both Siglecs, with Siglec-9 preferring 6-sulfo-SLex, and Siglec-7 binding well to both 6-sulfo-SLex and 6′-sulfo-SLex. Siglec-7 expression has also been reported in human pancreatic islet cell.Siglec-E in mice shows a combination of some features of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, being mainly expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, with Sia binding preferences that span those of both Siglec-7 and Siglec-9. Similar to T cells, NK cells in mice appear to lack expression of inhibitory Siglecs. Siglec-E is an important inhibitory receptor of neutrophils, as shown in multiple models such as LPS-induced lung inflammation in which Siglec-E-deficient mice show exaggerated CD11b-dependent neutrophil influx.Tumor cells often up-regulate cell surface sialylated glycans and it appears that these may be important in Siglec-dependent dampening of antitumor immunity. Siglecs-7 and -9 can both suppress NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing relevant glycan ligands. Siglec-9 and Siglec-E can also dampen neutrophil activation and tumor cell killing, whereas ligation of Siglec-9 or Siglec-E on macrophages by tumor-associated glycans seems to suppress formation of tumor-promoting M2 macrophages. In contrast to steady state, T cells in cancer patients express Siglec-9, and engagement of Siglec-9 by cancer-associated ligands may negatively impact tumor immunity, as do classic immune checkpoint receptor–ligand interactions. Overall Siglec effects on tumor cell biology may be dualistic, depending on the stage of tumor cell growth.Studies with GBS have also shown that sialylated bacteria can subvert innate immune responses by targeting Siglec-9 or Siglec-E on neutrophils and macrophages, resulting in attenuation of phagocytosis, killing, and proinflammatory cytokine production. It has also been shown that myeloid Siglecs such as Siglec-9 and Siglec-E can modulate TLR signaling in response to pathogen ligands, leading to reduced secretion of proinflammatory mediators like TNF and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.Siglec-8 has three Ig domains and is expressed on eosinophils and mast cells, with weaker expression on basophils. It binds strongly to 6′-sulfo-SLex and to high-molecular-weight glycoproteins isolated from human airways. In mast cells, Siglec-8 ligation (with antibody) inhibits FcεRI-triggered degranulation responses, in line with its role as an inhibitory receptor. In eosinophils, Siglec-8 triggers apoptosis, which can occur following cross-linking with anti-Siglec-8 antibodies or sialoglycan polymers. Apoptosis depends on generation of reactive oxygen species and caspase activation, and is paradoxically enhanced in the presence of cytokine “survival” factors such as interleukin-5 (IL-5). The restricted expression of Siglec-8 on immune cells involved in allergy and the induction of cell death on antibody-mediated cross-linking make it an attractive therapeutic target for allergic diseases, and clinical trials of anti-Siglec-8 antibody in these diseases are ongoing.Although there is no ortholog of Siglec-8 in mice, the four-Ig domain mouse Siglec-F is expressed in a similar way to Siglec-8 on eosinophils and has a similar glycan-binding preference for 6′-sulfo-SLex. It appears to have acquired similar functions through convergent evolution. There are some important differences, however. Siglec-F can recognize a broader range of α2-3-linked Sias, is also expressed on alveolar macrophages, and triggers weaker apoptosis using different signaling pathways.Siglec-F-null mice show exaggerated eosinophilic responses in a lung allergy model, suggesting that its normal role is to dampen such responses. Interestingly, Siglec-F ligands in the airways and lung parenchyma were also up-regulated during allergic inflammation.Siglec-10 has five Ig-like domains, and in addition to the ITIM and ITIM-like motifs, displays an additional tyrosine-based motif (predicted to interact with Grb2) in its cytoplasmic tail. It is expressed at relatively low levels on several cells of the immune system, including B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. It can also be strongly up-regulated on tumor-infiltrating NK cells in hepatocellular carcinoma in which its expression was negatively associated with patient survival. It is the only CD33-related human Siglec that has a clear-cut ortholog in mice, designated Siglec-G. Both Siglec-10 and Siglec-G prefer Neu5Gc more than Neu5Ac in both α2-3 and α2-6 linkages. Similar to Siglec-10, Siglec-G is mainly expressed on B-cell subsets, DCs, and weakly on eosinophils. Mice deficient in Siglec-G show a 10-fold increase in numbers of a specialized subset of B lymphocytes, the B1a cells that make natural antibodies. These Siglec-G deficient B1a cells also show exaggerated Ca-fluxing following BCR cross-linking. Studies using “knock-in” mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the Sia-binding site of Siglec-G show a similar phenotype. This appears to be due to a requirement of Sia-dependent cis-interactions between Siglec-G and the BCR. On DCs, Siglec-G has been proposed to regulate cytokine responses to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by necrotic cells in sterile inflammation. This is thought to be due to a dampening effect of cis-interactions between Siglec-G and the heavily sialylated DAMP receptor, CD24. Disruption of this interaction through sialidases released by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae may be important in triggering inflammatory responses in sepsis. CD24 is overexpressed in some cancers and engages Siglec-10 on macrophages to suppress phagocytosis, in much the same way as does the classic “don\\'t-eat-me” ligand–receptor pair, CD47 and SIRPα.Siglec-11 and Siglec-16 are paired inhibitory and activating receptors, with five and four Ig domains, respectively. In most humans, the SIGLEC16 gene has a 4-base-pair deletion, and only ∼35% of humans express one or two functional alleles. The extracellular regions of these proteins are >99% identical because of gene conversion events. Siglec-11 and Siglec-16 bind weakly to α2-8-linked Sias in vitro. These Siglecs appear to be absent from circulating leukocytes, but are expressed widely on populations of tissue macrophages, including resident microglia in the brain, where high levels of α2-8-linked Sias are present on gangliosides. Expression of Siglec-11 on microglia can impair their phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, yet alleviates neurotoxicity by suppressing neuroinflammation. Interestingly, microglial expression of Siglec-11 appears unique to humans. Siglec-16 is also present on microglia. These paired receptors exhibit dualistic responses to Escherichia coli K1, which expresses polysialic acid ligands.The ancestral condition of some hominid Siglecs (e.g., Siglec-11) appears to have been preferential binding to Neu5Gc, a Sia specifically lost in human evolution ∼2–3 million years ago (Chapter 15). This loss could have resulted in some Siglec unmasking, possibly leading to a state of heightened innate immune reactivity. Some human Siglecs have undergone an adjustment to allow increased Neu5Ac binding, and the question arises whether the adjustment is yet complete. Possibly, as a consequence of Neu5Gc loss, several Siglecs seem to have undergone human-specific changes in comparison to our great ape evolutionary cousins. For example, Sn is expressed on most human macrophages, whereas only subsets of chimpanzee macrophages are positive. This may be related to the fact that Sn has a strong binding preference for Neu5Ac rather than Neu5Gc, which is not synthesized by humans. Human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 appear to have undergone a restoration of the “essential” arginine residue needed for Sia recognition, which is mutated in chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Siglec-7 is selectively expressed in human pancreatic islets. The gene encoding Siglec-11 has undergone a human-specific gene conversion, resulting in a new protein expression in brain microglia along with its paired receptor, Siglec-16. Siglec-12 has suffered a human-specific and human universal inactivation of the “essential” arginine residue with subsequent permanent pseudogenization by a frameshift in some humans. Siglec-13 underwent a human-specific gene deletion and Siglec-17 has a frameshift mutation, events possibly occurring close to the time of the common ancestor of modern humans. Expression patterns of some Siglecs have also undergone changes, with placental expression of Siglec-6 and amniotic epithelium expression of Siglec-5/14 being human-specific, and a general suppression of all CD33rSiglecs on human T cells compared with the chimpanzee. The functional implications of these human-specific changes in Siglec biology for physiology and disease are under exploration and may be related to human propensities for certain diseases (Chapter 15).Although CD33rSiglecs can modulate innate immune cell responses via recognition of endogenous sialoglycans as “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), many pathogens take advantage of this property by generating sialylated molecular mimics on their surfaces, using a variety of biochemical mechanisms. The naturally occurring “essential” arginine mutations mentioned above appear to be one way that the host can evade this subversion. However, pathogens in turn have evolved mechanisms to directly engage CD33rSiglecs via protein–protein interactions—for example, the β-protein of Type-Ia GBS engages human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 independent of Sias. Early evidence indicates that more such examples exist, as well as alternate endogenous nonsialylated ligands within the host, such as the heat-shock protein HSP-70, cardiolipin, and another self-glycan, hyaluronan. As with many other classes of receptors whose original discovery was based on one canonical function, it is likely that evolutionary forces have generated many other functions for Siglecs, independent of their ability to recognize sialoglycans.The authors appreciate contributions of Paul Crocker to the earlier editions and helpful comments and suggestions from Pamela Stanley and Susan L.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.36Richard D. Cummings, Fu-Tong Liu, Gabriel A. Rabinovich, Sean R. Stowell, and Gerardo R. Vasta.Galectins are among the most widely expressed class of lectins in all organisms. They typically bind β-galactose-containing glycoconjugates and share primary structural homology in their carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). Galectins have many biological functions, including roles in development, regulation of immune cell activities, and microbial recognition as part of the innate immune system. This chapter describes the diversity of the galectin family and presents an overview of what is known about their biosynthesis, secretion, and biological roles.Following the discovery of the Ashwell–Morell asialoglycoprotein receptor (AMR) in the liver, many investigators sought other such receptors by affinity chromatography with immobilized asialoglycoproteins. In 1975, a novel lectin of ∼15 kDa was isolated from electric organs of the electric eel, and named “electrolectin.” This noncovalently linked homodimer displayed hemagglutinating activity toward trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes that was inhibitable by β-galactosides; inclusion of β-mercaptoethanol in the isolation buffers was required to maintain the binding activity. Soon thereafter, in 1976, similar β-galactoside-binding lectins were isolated from chicken muscle and from extracts of calf heart and lung (∼15 kDa; now designated as galectin-1). These proteins were initially referred to as S-type lectins to denote their sulfhydryl dependency, presence of free cysteine residues, and solubility, along with shared primary sequence. In the early 1980s, a 35-kDa protein termed CBP35 that also bound to β-galactosides was identified in mouse fibroblasts. The same protein was studied by other groups under the names IgE-binding protein, L-29, and L-31 and is currently known as galectin-3.The nomenclature for galectins was systematized in 1994 and the first galectin type found (∼15 kDa, discussed above) retained the name galectin-1. All other members of this family were numbered consecutively by order of discovery. Multiple distinct galectins are usually expressed in a single species (up to 15 in the mouse). A list of the vertebrate galectins is shown in Figure 36.1A.Different types of galectins in vertebrates and invertebrates and their organization and sequences. (A) Fifteen types of vertebrate galectins are known. (B) Sequence alignments of some representative human galectins are shown. The amino acid numbering (more...)Galectins are identified based on a shared amino acid sequence motif in their CRDs. The CRD of galectins has ∼130 amino acids, although only a small number of residues within the CRD directly contact glycan ligands. A comparison of more than 100 galectin sequences from many different sources reveals that eight residues, which have been shown to be involved in glycan binding by X-ray crystallographic analyses, are mostly invariant. In addition, another dozen residues appear to be highly conserved. Part of the conserved galectin sequence motif is shown in Figure 36.1B, along with a comparison of several human galectins. Many galectins contain variable numbers of free Cys residues, whose redox state is related to the stability of their binding activity. Interestingly, and unlike most galectins, electrolectin does not contain free Cys residues, but a key Trp in the binding site of its CRD can be oxidized, causing loss of activity.Based on their CRD number and organization, galectins have been classified into three major groups: proto-type galectins (galectin-1, -2, -7, -10, -11, -13, -14, and -15), which contain a single CRD and may associate as homodimers; chimera-type galectins (galectin-3), which are characterized by having a single CRD and an amino-terminal polypeptide “tail” rich in proline, glycine, and tyrosine residues through which it can form oligomers; and tandem-repeat galectins (galectin-4, -8, -9, and -12), which comprise two protein domains that each carry a CRD connected by a peptide linker that can range from five to >50 amino acids in length. Galectin transcripts may be differentially spliced to generate multiple isoforms. Invertebrates have galectins with one, two, or four tandemly arrayed CRDs.Some galectins appear to be species-specific, such as galectin-5 (prototype) and galectin-6 (tandem repeat) that are found in rodents but not humans, galectin-11 (ovagal11; prototype) that has only been reported in sheep, and galectin-15 that has only been found in sheep and goat. The amino-terminal domain of galectin-12 has significant homologies with other galectins, whereas the carboxy-terminal domain displays greater divergence from other galectins.Several proteins with sequence homology to galectins, which do not bind typical β-galactosides, have been described as galectin-related proteins (GRPs). For example, galectin-10 is the Charcot–Leyden crystal protein, is highly abundant in eosinophil granules, and preferentially binds to β-mannosides. Thus, in retrospect, galectin-10 was actually the earliest galectin discovered. Several GRPs, including GRIFIN (galectin-related interfiber protein), PP-13, and PPL-13 that lack glycan-binding activity, are related to galectin-10. It is noteworthy that the DrGRIFIN homolog in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a functional β-galactoside-binding protein and, like its mammalian counterpart, is also highly expressed in the eye lens.Hallmarks of the galectin family are the extensive taxonomic distribution of its members, together with the evolutionary conservation of their primary structures, gene organization, and structure of the CRD. The early emergence and structural conservation of the galectin family in eukaryotic evolution is revealed in the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea, in the sponge Geodia cydonium, and in a protein that displays the galectin fold in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Galectin-like sequences have also been identified in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) and some viruses that infect pigs and fish, such as the porcine adenovirus and lymphocystis disease virus. However, galectin-like proteins or sequence motifs in the latter should be interpreted with caution as they could result from horizontal gene transfer.The evolution of the galectin family has been inferred from the rigorous analysis of primary structures, gene organization, and taxonomic distribution of family members identified in a variety of organisms, including fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Among the arthropods and nematodes, galectins appear to be abundant in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (6 and 26 candidate genes, respectively). Generally, the primary structures and domain organizations of galectins from invertebrates do not fit the canonical features of vertebrate galectins described above (Figure 36.1C).Galectins are ubiquitous in vertebrates. In fish, galectins have been identified and characterized in numerous species. The zebrafish (D. rerio) genome has ortholog genes for all three galectin types (proto-, chimera-, and tandem-repeat) identified in mammals. Among amphibians, several galectin subtypes have been found in various tissues, mucus, and eggs from salamanders (the axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum), toads (Rhinella arenarum), and frogs (Lithobates catesbeianus and Xenopus laevis).The evolution of galectins along the vertebrate taxa leading to mammals has been rationalized as the duplication of an early single-CRD galectin gene that would have led to a bi-CRD galectin gene. The amino- and carboxy-terminal CRDs subsequently diverged into two different subtypes, defined by an exon–intron structure (F4-CRD and F3-CRD). In this nomenclature, F refers to the β-sandwich strand structure discussed below. All vertebrate single-CRD galectins belong to either the F3- (e.g., galectin-1, -2, -3, -5) or F4- (e.g., galectin-7, -10, -13, -14) subtype, whereas the mammalian tandem-repeat galectins such as galectin-4, -6, -8, -9, and -12 contain both F4 and F3 subtypes. However, how the multiple CRD galectins from invertebrates relate to the vertebrate tandem-repeat galectins remains to be fully understood, but a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the oyster galectin CvGal1 revealed that the individual CRDs cluster with the mammalian single-CRD galectins rather than with the tandem-repeat galectins, suggesting that the CvGal1 gene is the product of two consecutive gene duplications of a single-CRD galectin gene ancestral to the early invertebrate taxa that was conserved along the chordate lineages.The crystal structures of several galectins in complexes with glycan ligands are known, including galectins-1, -2, and -7, the carboxy-terminal domain of galectin-3, and individual domains of galectins-4, -8, and -9. In all cases, the galectin CRD is composed of five- and six-stranded antiparallel β-sheets arranged in a β-sandwich or jelly-roll configuration that lacks an α-helix (Figure 36.2A). In the dimeric proteins, such as galectins-1, -2, and -7, the subunits are related by a twofold rotational axis perpendicular to the plane of the β-sheets. The glycan-binding sites in the CRD are located at opposite ends of the dimer, except the orientation of the subunits in the galectin-7 dimer differs from the other canonical galectin dimers. The compactly arranged structure of the CRD partly explains the protease resistance of the galectin CRD and the high degree of conservation and requirement for the 130 amino acids in the CRD.(A) Ribbon diagram of the crystal structure of human galectin-1 complexed with lactose. The homodimer is shown with each monomer colored differently and orthogonal views are presented. The subunit interface is based on interactions between the carboxy- (more...)The galectin-1 CRD displays highly specific interactions with Gal and GlcNAc residues in typical glycans. Interactions with glycans are generally through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals interactions through ring stacking with Gal and the highly conserved Trp residue (Figures 36.2B,C). In general, the open-ended structure of the glycan-binding site is predicted to allow access to extended Gal-containing glycans, such as the poly-N-acetyllactosamines and blood group–related structures (Chapter 14).The binding preference of invertebrate galectins for blood group glycans can be illustrated by a unique structural feature of the binding site of the C. elegans and oyster galectins. They show a significantly shorter loop 4 that accommodates the 2′-fucosyl moiety that is a common feature of both the A and B blood groups (Figure 36.3A,B). The α(1-3)-linked GalNAc or Gal moieties of the A and B blood group tetrasaccharides, respectively, are recognized by the -NH at position 5 of the conserved Trp, and a hydrophobic pocket at the external side of the β3-strand (amino acids 30–38) recognizes the methyl of the -NAc group in α(1-3)GalNAc of the A1/2 antigens.Structural aspects of galectins from mammals and invertebrates. (A) Sequence alignment of the CRD regions from bovine galectin-1, zebrafish Drgal1-L2, Caenorhabditis elegans N16, and the CRDs 1–4 of CvGal1. (B) Homology modeling of the CRDs from (more...)There are several known and predicted subsites on galectins near the carbohydrate-binding site that could serve to enhance affinity for more extended glycans. Some of these subsites have been identified by structural analysis of galectins binding to glycans and by glycan-binding studies. The crystal structure of bovine galectin-1 was derived in a complex with a biantennary N-glycan containing two terminal β-Gal residues. The N-glycan is bridged between two galectin-1 dimers, thus effectively creating a crystal latticework. This type of crystal latticework may be unique among vertebrate galectins and may be critical for their signaling and adhesive functions (Figures 36.4 and 36.5).Possible biosynthetic routes for galectins in animal cells, using galectin-1 as an example. The mRNA for a galectin is translated on free polysomes in the cytoplasm and the newly synthesized protein is capable of binding glycan ligands or interacting (more...)Functional interactions of galectins with cell-surface glycoconjugates and extracellular glycoconjugates leads to cell adhesion and cell signaling. Interactions of galectins with intracellular proteins may contribute to regulating intracellular pathways. (more...)The interactions of galectins with glycans are complex and several factors contribute to high-affinity binding, including their natural multivalency and oligomeric state, as well as the multivalency of their natural ligands. Although most galectins bind weakly to simple β-galactosides, such as disaccharides or trisaccharides (Kd in the high micromolar to low millimolar range), they typically bind much stronger to natural glycoconjugate ligands (apparent Kd in the submicromolar range). Studies utilizing large libraries of glycans reveal that each galectin CRD recognizes different glycan ligands and shows highest affinity binding to different structures. For example, galectin-3 binds tightly to glycans with repeating [-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-]n or poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences containing 3-4 repeating units, regardless of the presence of terminal β-Gal residue, and binding is further enhanced if the penultimate β-Gal residues are substituted with Galα1-3, GalNAcα1-3, or Fucα1-2 residues. In contrast, human galectin-1 binds well only to glycans with terminal β-Gal residues, and does not bind blood group antigens. Galectin-8 has two CRDs within its single polypeptide and the two CRDs bind different glycans. Thus, the amino-terminal CRD of human galectin-8 binds α2-3-sialylated glycans with high affinity (Kd∼50 nm), whereas the carboxy-terminal CRD binds to the blood group A determinant on a LacNAc core and does not bind sialylated glycans.Cocrystallization of galectins with simple β-Gal-containing disaccharides has revealed that many galectins establish H-bonds to the C4 and C6 hydroxyl of Gal and the C3 hydroxyl of GlcNAc (Figure 36.3). The binding sites of galectins may be viewed as containing several subsites: one for Gal, another for GlcNAc, and other subsites that may be filled by other sugars and the aglycone moiety (e.g., protein or lipid). Thus, other sugar units linked to the disaccharide Gal-GlcNAc can enhance or decrease binding affinity, depending on the galectin. Some galectins from fungi, invertebrates, and mammals (such as galectins-4 and -8) preferentially bind selected ABO(H) blood group glycans as discussed above.Galectins bind selectively to only some cell-surface and extracellular matrix ligands at low lectin concentrations but at higher concentrations they more often show broad binding to many different glycoproteins. However, the precise physiological ligands for each galectin and the physiological concentrations of galectins at sites of interactions are not well understood.Galectins can also bind to exogenous ligands, such as exposed glycans on the surface of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, displaying a remarkable diversity of recognition. For example, galectin-1 can bind to complex type N-glycans on the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein and to Trichomonas vaginalis lipophosphoglycan, whereas galectin-3 recognizes both terminal and internal N-acetyllactosamine units in lipopolysaccharides from meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis), LacdiNAc from Schistosoma mansoni, and oligomannans from Candida albicans. The lipophosphoglycan from Leishmania major is recognized by both galectins-3 and -9, whereas galectin-4 recognizes Escherichia coli strains that display blood group B glycans.All members of the galectin family lack a classical signal sequence or membrane-anchoring domains and are synthesized on free polysomes in the cytoplasm before secretion. Galectins are unusual among all types of animal lectins in that they can be found in the nucleus, cytosol, outer plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix. One rather common modification of galectins in animal cells is blockage of the amino terminus, although galectin-3 has been shown to also have two serine residues in its unique amino-terminal region that can be phosphorylated. Newly synthesized galectins isolated directly from the cytosol of cells are functional in binding β-galactosides.Interestingly, there is compelling evidence for galectins having nonglycan-binding partners in the cytosol. Galectin biosynthesis is unusual among all types of glycan-binding proteins as galectins are synthesized in the cytoplasm. The mechanism by which galectins can reach the outside of cells is poorly understood. A model of this complexity, as suggested for galectin-1, is illustrated schematically in Figure 36.4. Curiously, the export of galectins from cells does not involve direct movement through the secretory pathway. It appears the secretion and availability of glycan ligands in the cells generating the galectin may regulate export, activity, and stability of galectins.Members of the galectin family display a striking functional diversification that ranges from key roles in early development, tissue regeneration, and cancer to immune homeostasis and recognition/effector functions against potential pathogens. By binding to endogenous glycans, galectins can contribute to cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, and galectin signaling at the cell surface can also modulate cellular functions. In addition, intracellular galectins may, as in the case of galectin-3, regulate cellular activities and may contribute to some fundamental processes such as pre-mRNA splicing (Figure 36.5). The galectin-mediated recognition of glycans on the surface of potential pathogens and parasites discovered in the past few years has revealed their role(s) as pattern recognition receptors and effector factors in innate immune functions. Much information about the biological functions of galectins has been revealed largely through using galectin-deficient mouse models. Such studies, which have been performed primarily in mice deficient in galectins-1, -3, -7, and -9, have revealed roles of galectins in a wide range of physiological pathways (Chapter 41).Studies in murine and zebrafish models revealed that during early embryonic stages, galectin-1 and -3 are expressed in the notochord and play subtle, albeit key roles in notochord development, somitogenesis, and development of muscle tissue and the central nervous system. Lack of galectin-3 in knockout mice is associated with several subtle and apparently unrelated phenotypic changes, whereas lack of galectin-1 in mice is associated with a different set of phenotypic changes, including decreased sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli, altered primary afferent neural anatomy, and aberrant topography of olfactory axons. In addition, expression of galectin-3 at the onset of chondrification suggests its role in bone development. Recent studies have unraveled the critical role of galectin-1 in angiogenesis, as the basis for resistance of certain tumors to otherwise effective antivascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy. It should also be noted that some galectins are involved in regeneration of injured tissue. For example, on photoinduced retinal damage in the zebrafish, galectin-1 is one of the first proteins secreted by stem cells in the Müller glia, and is responsible for rod regeneration. Galectin-7 is important in the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis and skin repair.Several galectins induce apoptosis in some types of blood cells. For galectin-1, this activity has been studied mostly in human T cells, particularly Th1 and Th17 cells, in which apoptotic pathways may involve cell-surface glycoproteins, including CD7, CD29, CD45, and CD43. In contrast, for galectin-3 induction of apoptosis in T cells involves CD71 and CD45. In some cells, apoptotic signaling may function through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspases. The interactions of galectin-9 with Tim-3 on Th1 cells may induce their apoptosis. In addition, some galectins, such as galectins-1, -2, and -4, also can induce exposure of cell-surface phosphatidylserine independently of apoptotic events. Moreover, overexpression of intracellular galectin-3 shows antiapoptotic activity, whereas overexpression of galectins-7 and -12 may promote apoptosis in cells. Some potential intracellular binding partners of galectins, especially for galectin-3, include several proteins involved in regulating apoptosis, such as Bcl-2, Fas receptor (CD95), synexin (a Ca++- and phospholipid-binding protein), and Alix/Alg-2.Many tumors overexpress various galectins and their heightened expression usually correlates with clinical aggressiveness of the tumor as well as progression to a metastatic phenotype. The immunosuppressive effects of galectin-1 can contribute to tumor survival, as revealed by knockdown studies, in which decreased galectin-1 expression is associated with decreased tumor survival, owing to increased survival of interferon- γ (IFN-γ)-producing Th1 cells and heightened T cell–mediated tumor rejection. Studies using galectin-1 knockout cell lines and mice have shown that expression of galectin-1 in tumor cell endothelium is essential for tumor angiogenesis, based on the binding of galectin-1 to complex N-glycans on VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and activation of VEGF-like signaling. Thus, galectins play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis through indirect effects in regulating tumor immune responses and direct effects in tumor angiogenesis. Although silencing of galectin-3 expression by methylation of its promoter is associated with early stages of prostate cancer, overexpression of galectin-3 correlates well with neoplastic transformation and tumor progression toward metastasis.Galectins are important as regulators of immune and inflammatory responses. Galectins are expressed by a number of different immune and inflammatory cells. In addition, galectins can promote pro- or anti-inflammatory responses, depending on the inflammatory stimulus, microenvironment, and the target cell. Immune cell responses to galectins also depend on the specific glycosylation of surface glycoproteins to generate galectin ligands. However, many of these functions were shown by using recombinant galectins added to cultured cells. Whether these reflect the functions of endogenous galectins is not well understood.Galectin-3, through its multivalent interactions, can form lattices with cell-surface glycoproteins—for example, with T-cell receptor (TCR) and the immune synapse (e.g., the interface between an antigen-presenting cell and a T/B cell or natural killer cell). Expression of such N-glycans is partly regulated by branching of N-glycans through β6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5). Mgat5 null T cells show enhanced clustering of TCRs suggesting that branched N-glycans interacting with galectin-3 may normally restrict TCR clustering and serve as a hindrance to the development of T-cell responses. The nature of glycan branching, interactions with galectins and perhaps other multivalent lectins, as well as metabolic regulation are intertwined. Interestingly, subcutaneous injections of recombinant human galectins-1 and -9 can reduce the severity of several autoimmune diseases in various animal models, but the underlying mechanisms for these in vivo immunosuppressive activities are unclear.Studies of mice deficient in a certain galectin indicate that galectins have roles in immune responses and inflammation. Most studies suggest that endogenous galectin-1 functions as a homeostatic mechanism to counterbalance exuberant T-cell and dendritic-cell responses. Moreover, endogenous galectin-3 plays a role in phagocytosis by macrophages and mediator release as well as cytokine production by mast cells. These have been linked to this galectin functioning either extracellularly through binding to glycosylated receptors or intracellularly, in a fashion that is independent of glycan binding.Current studies suggest a complex set of functions for galectin-3 in regulating many aspects of inflammatory responses and its role as a proinflammatory mediator. Although clearly complex, there have been some exciting developments linking galectins to inflammatory diseases in humans. Elevated serum galectin-3 levels are associated with a worse prognosis in patients with heart failure, and the plasma level of galectin-3 is a promising biomarker for acute coronary syndrome. Studies of galectin-3-knockout mice suggest a role for galectin-3 in cardiomyopathy and cardiac fibrosis. In other mouse disease models, endogenous galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis in various organs and tissues.Recent studies have revealed critical and opposing roles of galectins-3 and -12 in adipogenesis and their association with obesity, inflammation, and type II diabetes. Galectin-12 is expressed in adipocytes and associated with lipid droplets, and functions as a negative regulator of lipolysis and insulin sensitivity. Galectin-12 knockout mice show increased lipolysis and reduced adiposity. In contrast, galectin-3 knockout mice display age-dependent increased adiposity, dysregulated glucose metabolism, and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, these mice show accelerated diabetes-associated kidney damage and diet-induced atherogenesis, with proinflammatory changes in visceral adipose tissue and pancreas.Galectins can also recognize exogenous glycans and related moieties on the surfaces of microbial pathogens and parasites, and function not only as pattern recognition receptors but also as effector factors, by directly inhibiting adhesion and/or entry into the host cell, or by directly killing or promoting phagocytosis of the potential pathogen. For example, galectin MjGal from the kuruma shrimp (Penacus japonicus) can recognize bacterial pathogens and promote their phagocytosis. Galectin-1 directly binds to dengue virus and inhibits viral adhesion and internalization into host cells. Similarly, the zebrafish galectins Drgal1-L2 and Drgal3-L1 interact directly with the glycosylated envelope of the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus and with the glycans on the epithelial cell surface, significantly reducing viral adhesion. In mammals, the tandem-repeat galectins-4 and -8 can recognize and kill E. coli strains that display B-blood group oligosaccharides (BGB+E. coli). Mutation of key residues in either CRD revealed that the C-CRD mediates recognition the BGB+E. coli and promotes activity toward bacteria. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that galectins can function not only in immune recognition but also as effector factors in innate immune responses against pathogens.As lectins present in the cytosol with no commonly occurring glycan ligand, galectins are uniquely poised to detect abnormal cystosolic exposure of glycans during cell injury. Many intracellular bacteria are capable of inducing phagosomal lysis and escaping into the cytosol, after being phagocytosed into the host cells. This vacuolar lysis process exposes the host glycans that are initially present in the lumen of the phagosomes to the cytosolic milieu. Galectins-3 and -8 have been shown to bind to these exposed glycans, and galectin-8 has been shown to subsequently lead to autophagic activation for autophagosome degradation of the bacteria.In contrast, some pathogens and parasites can “subvert” the roles of host galectins in immune defense, to attach to or gain entry into host cells. For example, galectin-1 promotes infection by HIV-1 by facilitating viral attachment to CD4 receptors, and increasing infection efficiency. Leishmania species, which are transmitted by sandflies, attach to the insect midgut epithelium via the sandfly galectin PpGalec that binds to Gal(β1-3) side chains on the Leishmania lipophosphoglycan (LPG), to prevent their excretion along with the digested bloodmeal, and allow them to differentiate into free-swimming infective metacyclics. Similarly, the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus, a facultative intracellular parasite of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is recognized via the galectins CvGal1 and CvGal2, that are expressed by phagocytic hemocytes. The parasite is phagocytosed by the oyster hemocytes and proliferates, eventually causing systemic infection and death of the oyster host. Galectin-1 has been identified as the receptor for the protozoan parasite T. vaginalis and the bacterium Chlamydia tracheomatis, causative agents of the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted human infection in both women and men. Like Leishmania spp, T. vaginalis displays a surface LPG rich in Gal and GlcNAc, which is recognized in a glycan-dependent manner by galectin-1 expressed by the epithelial cells in the cervical linings (as well as placenta, prostate, endometrial, and decidual tissue), colonized by the parasite. Related types of studies also show the roles of galectins-1 and -3 in influenza/pneumococcal pneumonia infections of bronchoalveolar space, and that galectins might be involved in virus and bacterial binding. The expression of galectins in animal tissues is tightly regulated, but can be modulated by a variety of stimuli, including infectious challenge, and this may be especially important in innate immune responses.The authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Yasuhiro Ozeki.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Kohler, and Markus Aebi.Symbiotic, commensal, and pathogenic microorganisms employ cell-surface glycans as targets for interaction with the host. Surface proteins (adhesins or agglutinins) mediate binding to such glycan “receptors,” and many microbes depend on these interactions for success in the host. In addition, antagonistic interactions are mediated by secreted toxins that use surface glycan targets for internalization by various mechanisms. This chapter highlights examples of microbial lectins and their roles in pathogenicity. In addition, the modes of action of glycan-dependent toxins is discussed.During the last 70 years, an enormous array of glycan-binding proteins (lectins) of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa have been discovered and characterized. Many of these microbial lectins were originally detected based on their ability to aggregate or induce the hemagglutination of red blood cells (erythrocytes). The influenza virus hemagglutinin was the first identified pathogen glycan-binding protein, shown by Alfred Gottschalk in the early 1950s to bind erythrocytes and other cells via the sialic acid component of host cell-surface glycoconjugates. Don Wiley and associates crystallized the influenza hemagglutinin and determined its structure in 1981. Later, they solved the structure of hemagglutinin cocrystals bound to sialyllactose, providing molecular insight into the affinity and specificity of the receptor-ligand binding sites.Nathan Sharon and colleagues first described bacterial surface lectins in the 1970s. Their primary function is to facilitate the attachment or adherence of bacteria to host cells, a prerequisite for bacterial colonization and infection (Chapter 42). Thus, bacterial lectins are often called adhesins, and these bind corresponding glycan receptors on the surface of the host cells via carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) (“receptor” in this case is equivalent to “ligand” for animal cell lectins). Microbial adhesins can bind terminal sugar residues or internal sequences found in linear or branched oligosaccharide chains. These interactions are often an important determinant of host and tissue tropism. Detailed studies of the specificity of such microbial lectins have led to the identification and synthesis of powerful inhibitors of adhesion that may form the basis for novel therapeutic agents to combat infectious disease (Chapter 42). In fact, mammals often produce their own glycan decoys such as secreted mucins and milk oligosaccharides that help prevent binding of pathogen adhesins to their host cell targets.Glycan-dependent interactions are important for both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. For example, bacteria produce multimeric soluble toxins, whose glycan-binding subunits target and deliver the toxic cargo to the cell. In contrast, the normal flora of the lower gastrointestinal tract is determined by appropriate and desirable colonization by beneficial bacteria that engage in binding and digestion of host and dietary glycans. Likewise, the initial formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules in leguminous root tips by species of Rhizobium involves lectins on the root tip binding to glycan-containing Nod factors generated by the bacterium (Chapter 24).The first discovered and most well-studied example of a viral glycan-binding protein is the influenza virus hemagglutinin. Similar to most other lectin–glycan interactions, the affinity of this sialic acid–binding lectin is low. Avidity is increased by hemagglutinin trimerization and a high density of host cell surface glycan receptors. Binding is required for viral endocytosis and the subsequent pH-dependent fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, ultimately triggering release of the viral RNA into the cytosol. The specificity of the host glycan–hemagglutinin interaction varies considerably for different subtypes of influenza. For example, human strains of influenza-A and -B viruses bind primarily to cells containing N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Acα)2–6Gal-containing receptors. However, avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to receptors expressing Neu5Acα2–3Gal-, and porcine strains bind to both Neu5Acα2–6Gal- and -3Gal-containing receptors (Table 37.1). This linkage preference is a result of structural differences in the hemagglutinin (Figure 37.1). Viral adherence also depends on receptor abundance, such that tracheal epithelial cells in humans express glycans with a preponderance of Neu5Acα2–6Gal linkages, whereas other deeper airway surfaces contain many more Neu5Acα2–3Gal-terminated glycans. Thus, the specificity of the hemagglutinin determines the tropism of the virus with respect to species and target cells. As a result, avian-derived strains have a greater likelihood of producing lower respiratory tract infection (pneumonia) than common human strains because of the high abundance of Neu5Acα2-3Gal linkages deep in the lung. Conversely, avian-derived strains have a reduced likelihood of human-to-human transmission compared to human strains because of the paucity of Neu5Acα2-3Gal in the upper respiratory tract. The hemagglutinin is the major antigen against which neutralizing antibodies are produced and influenza strains continuously acquire genetic changes that affect both glycan binding and antigenicity. Such changes are responsible in part for new outbreaks and are considered during formulation of the annual influenza vaccine.Structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) ectodomain.

Modeled carbohydrate side chains (gray, (more...)Examples of viral lectins and hemagglutinins In addition to the hemagglutinin “H,” influenza-A and -B virions express a sialidase (traditionally called neuraminidase “N”, Chapter 15) that cleaves sialic acids from glycoconjugates. Its functions may include (1) prevention of viral aggregation by removal of sialic acid residues from virion envelope glycoproteins; (2) dissociation of newly synthesized virions inside the cell or as they bud from the cell surface; and (3) desialylation of soluble mucins at sites of infection to improve access to cell surface sialic acids. Inhibitors have been designed based on the crystal structure of the sialidase from influenza-A virus. Some of these (e.g., oseltamivir) inhibit the enzyme activity at nanomolar concentrations and are used clinically as antiviral agents (Chapter 57). Influenza-C virions (and many coronaviruses) contain a single “hemagglutinin-esterase” that possesses both hemagglutinin and receptor-destroying activities, which in this case is an esterase that cleaves the 9-O-acetyl group from the target O-acetylated sialic acid receptors (Table 37.1). Some coronaviruses have evolved to adapt the spike “S” proteins to target O-acetylated sialic acid receptors. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has completely lost its hemagglutinin-esterase protein, but encodes an S protein that has evolved further, to bind more robustly to heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which can also act as a cofactor facilitating binding to a high-affinity protein receptor ACE2.Rotaviruses, the major killer of children worldwide, can also bind to sialic acid residues. These viruses only bind to the intestinal epithelium of newborn infants during a period that appears to correlate with the expression of specific types and arrangements of sialic acids on glycoproteins. Claims regarding “sialic acid–independent” rotaviruses may be explained by internal sialic acids resistant to bacterial sialidases. Many other viruses (e.g., adenovirus, reovirus, Sendai virus, and polyomavirus) also use sialic acids for infection, and crystal structures are now available for several of their sialic acid–binding domains.A number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), foot-and-mouth disease virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and dengue flavivirus, use heparan sulfate proteoglycans as adhesion receptors (Table 37.1). In many cases, the proteoglycans may be part of a coreceptor system in which viruses make initial contact with a cell-surface proteoglycan and later with another receptor. For example, HSV infection is thought to initially involve the binding of viral glycoproteins gB and/or gC to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Glycoprotein gB promotes virus-cell fusion, syncytium formation (cell–cell fusion), and adherence, whereas gC binds to the C3b component of complement and blocks complement-mediated inhibition of the virus. These events are followed by HSV glycoprotein gD binding to one of several cell-surface receptors, including protein receptors and heparan sulfate, ultimately leading to fusion of the viral envelope with the host-cell plasma membrane. Interestingly, the interaction of gD with heparan sulfate shows specificity for a particular substructure in heparan sulfate containing a 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residue, the formation of which is catalyzed by specific isozymes of the glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase gene family. Thus, the heparan sulfate–binding adhesins appear to recognize carbohydrate units within the polysaccharide chains as opposed to binding terminal sugars.Dengue flavivirus, the causative agent of dengue hemorrhagic fever, also binds to heparan sulfate. Computational modeling to compare the primary dengue viral envelope protein sequence with the crystal structure of a related virion envelope protein suggests that the heparan sulfate–binding site may lie along a positively charged amino acid groove (Figure 37.2). The recently emerging Zika virus belongs to the same family. Furthermore, HIV can bind heparan sulfate and other sulfated polysaccharides by way of the V3 loop of its gp120 glycoprotein.Two views of a putative heparin sulfate–binding site on the dengue virus envelope protein. The envelope protein monomer is shown in ribbon form, displayed along its longitudinal axis and as an external side view. Note the alignment of positively (more...)Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity. Because the adhesins and the receptors often cluster in the plane of the membrane, the resulting combinatorial avidity can be great. An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips. The most well-characterized bacterial lectins include the mannose-specific type-1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding F-17 fimbriae, which are produced by different strains of Escherichia coli. Fimbriated bacteria express 100 to 400 of these appendages, which typically have a diameter of 5–7 nm and can extend hundreds of nanometers in length (Figure 37.3) Thus, pili extend well beyond the bacterial glycocalyx comprised of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharides (see Chapter 21).Escherichia coli express hundreds of pili, as indicated by the fine filaments extending from the bacterium.

Hasty, University (more...)Examination of a high-resolution, three-dimensional structure of FimH bound to mannose revealed that, although mannose exists as a mixture of α and β anomers in solution, only the former was found in the complex. Mannose binds FimH at a deep and negatively charged site of FimH (Figure 37.4). FimH has “catch-bond” properties, such that the binding strength of individual FimH adhesins is augmented by increasing the shear forces on surface-bound E. coli cells. This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells. Uroplakin Ia presents high levels of terminally exposed mannose residues that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers. The resulting bacterial aggregates are flushed out of the urinary tract. Mice lacking the gene encoding the Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein are considerably more susceptible to bladder colonization by type-1-fimbriated E. coli than normal mice.The α anomer of mannose in the binding site of FimH. The mannose residue is buried in a unique site at the tip of the carbohydrate-recognition domain (left) in a deep and negatively charged pocket (right). FimH prefers to bind D-mannose in the (more...)Most bacteria (and possibly other microorganisms) have multiple adhesins with diverse carbohydrate specificities. Many of these have been described (examples in Table 37.2), wherein the specificity of lectin binding can help define the range of susceptible tissues in the host (i.e., the microbe\\'s ecological niche). The columnar epithelium that lines the large intestine expresses receptors with Galα1–4Gal-Cer residues, whereas cells lining the small intestine do not. Thus, Bacterioides, Clostridium, E. coli, and Lactobacillus only colonize the large intestine under normal conditions. P-fimbriated E. coli and some toxins bind specifically to galabiose (Galα1–4Gal) and galabiose-containing oligosaccharides, most commonly as constituents of glycolipids. Binding can occur to either internal (i.e., when the disaccharide is capped by other sugars) or terminal nonreducing galabiose units. P-fimbriated E. coli adhere mainly to the upper part of the kidney, where galabiose is abundant. The fine specificity of bacterial surface lectins and their relationship to the animal tropism of the bacteria can be further illustrated by E. coli K99. The K99 strain binds to glycolipids that contain N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), in the form of Neu5Gcα2–3Galβ1–4Glc, but not to those that contain N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). These two sugars differ by a single hydroxyl group that is present only on Neu5Gc. Interestingly, Neu5Gc-containing receptors are expressed on the intestinal cells of newborn piglets, but disappear as the animals grow and develop. As Neu5Gc is not normally biosynthesized by humans, this may explain why E. coli K99 can cause often lethal diarrhea in piglets but not in adult pigs or humans.Examples of interactions of bacterial adhesins with glycans A number of secreted bacterial toxins also bind glycans (Table 37.3). The toxin from Vibrio cholera (cholera toxin), which consists of A and B subunits in the ratio AB5, has been extensively studied. The crystal structure of cholera toxin shows that the carbohydrate-recognition domains are located at the base of the B subunits, which bind to the Galβ1–3GalNAc moiety of GM1 ganglioside (Chapter 11) receptors (Figure 37.5). On binding of the B subunits to membrane glycolipids, the AB5 complex is endocytosed to the Golgi apparatus and then undergoes retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The A1 and A2 chains are proteolytically cleaved on toxin secretion, but remain stably associated until arrival in the ER. There, the enzymatic A1 chain unfolds, dissociates from the A2-B5 complex, and retrotranslocates to the cytosol where it rapidly refolds, thereby avoiding degradation by the proteasome. Catalytically active A1 then ADP-ribosylates a regulatory homotrimeric G-protein to activate adenylyl cyclase, severely altering ion homeostasis of the infected cell.Crystal structure of the cholera toxin B-subunit pentamer bound to GM1 pentasaccharide, shown from the bottom (A) and the side (B).

(C) Crystal structure of the (more...)Examples of glycan receptors for bacterial toxins Shiga toxin, produced by Shigella dysenteriae, will bind to Galα1-4Gal determinants on both glycolipids and glycoproteins. However, only binding to the glycosphingolipid receptor Gb3 results in cell death. Similar to cholera toxin, the AB5 complex is endocytosed and transported to the ER of the target cells, and then the A1 subunit is retrotranslocated to the cytosol. There, the catalytic A1 chain of Shiga toxin inactivates ribosomes, and thus the essential process of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, by an N-glycosidic cleavage event that depurinates 28S rRNA.The most common class of bacterial toxins that are characterized by their pore-forming capability and a number of these toxins bind to glycans. For example, toxins produced by the soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used for crop protection by spraying plants or by genetically engineering crops to express the toxins. As such, these toxins function by binding glycolipids that line the insect gut and generating pores in the membrane. More specifically, the Bt toxin glycolipid receptors include in their structure the characteristic ceramide-linked, mannose-containing core tetrasaccharide GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Manβ1-4GlcβCer. This structure is conserved between nematodes and insects (see Chapter 25) but is absent in vertebrates including humans. This explains why Bt can kill larval stages of insects but is harmless to humans.Secondary glycan binding sites have been identified on some toxins. For example, cholera toxin can bind fucosylated glycans at a site distinct from the GM1 binding pocket, and Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) binds sulfated glycosaminoglycans in addition to GalNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3 Galβ1-4GlcβCer. Whereas these secondary interactions are lower affinity that those with the canonical receptors, the glycans recognized are abundant on the surface of host cells. Thus, glycan binding to secondary sites may serve as initial attachment events that capture and concentrate toxins on cell surfaces.In addition to viruses and bacteria, a number of parasites use glycans as receptors for adhesion (Table 37.4). Entamoeba histolytica expresses a 260-kDa heterodimeric lectin that binds to terminal Gal/GalNAc residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids via a cysteine-rich glycan-binding domain. This adhesin is essential for virulence, such that adhesin-glycan binding is required for parasitic attachment, invasion, and cytolysis of the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, it may function in binding E. histolytica to bacteria as a food source. This adhesin elicits protective immunity, and is a potential target to manage E. histolytica infection.Examples of glycan receptors for parasites The initial interaction of Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) merozoites with red blood cells (erythrocytes) depends on sialic acid residues present on the host cell, in particular on the major erythrocyte membrane protein glycophorin. Parasite–host attachment is mediated by a family of sialic acid–binding adhesins on merozoites, the most prominent of which is called erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 (EBA-175). This adhesin preferentially binds Neu5Ac sialic acids, rather than 9-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc, and is sensitive to the linkage of the sialic acid to the underlying galactose. This is highlighted by the fact that Neu5Acα2–3Gal-containing oligosaccharides effectively inhibit the binding of EBA-175 to erythrocytes, whereas soluble Neu5Ac and Neu5Acα2–6Gal-containing oligosaccharides do not. Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage.Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition.Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza.The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

Esko.Glycosaminoglycans bind to many different classes of proteins mostly through electrostatic interactions between negatively charged sulfate groups and uronic acids and positively charged amino acids in the protein. This chapter focuses on examples of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins, methods for measuring GAG–protein interaction, and information about three-dimensional structures of the complexes.In contrast to lectins, which tend to fall into evolutionarily conserved families (Chapters 28–37), GAG-binding proteins do not have common folds and instead appear to have evolved by convergent evolution. Several hundred GAG-binding proteins have been discovered, which make up the GAG-interactome and fall into the broad classes presented in Table 38.1. To a large extent, studies of the GAG-interactome have focused on protein interactions with heparin, a more highly sulfated, iduronic acid (IdoA)-rich form of heparan sulfate (HS; Chapter 17). This bias reflects, in part, the commercial availability of heparin and heparin-Sepharose, which are frequently used for fractionation studies, and the partially incorrect assumption that binding to heparin mimics binding to HS present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. There are also a large number of proteins known to interact with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) with comparable avidity and affinity; there are fewer examples of specific interactions with keratan sulfate (KS), but this may reflect fewer studies of KS. In some cases, CS may be the physiologically relevant ligand because CS predominates in many tissues. Determining the physiological relevance of these interactions is a major area of research.Examples of various classes of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins Interactions between GAGs and proteins can have profound physiological effects on processes such as hemostasis, lipid transport and absorption, cell growth and migration, and development. Binding to GAGs can result in immobilization of proteins at their sites of production or in the extracellular matrix for future mobilization, regulation of enzyme activity, binding of proteins to their receptors, protein oligomerization, and protection of proteins against degradation. Several viruses and bacteria also exploit GAGs expressed in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces as attachment factors. For example, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, enters through the respiratory tract and infects epithelial cells lining the airways by interactions of the viral spike protein with heparan sulfate. The ability of virions to attach to cell-surface heparan sulfate facilitates capture of the virus and transfer to proteinaceous receptors (e.g., host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in the case of SARS-CoV-2) as well as subsequent viral glycoprotein processing and infection. The interactions of GAG-binding proteins are often driven by a general complementarity of charge (e.g., thrombin–heparin interactions). In some cases, the interaction has been shown to depend on rare but specific sequences of modified sugars in the GAG chain (e.g., antithrombin binding).Numerous methods are available for analyzing GAG–protein interactions, and some provide a direct measurement of Kd values. A common method involves affinity fractionation of proteins on Sepharose columns containing covalently linked GAG chains, usually heparin. The bound proteins are eluted with different concentrations of sodium chloride, and the concentration required for elution is generally proportional to the Kd. High-affinity interactions require 0.5–2 m NaCl to displace bound ligand, which usually translates into Kd values of 10−7–10−9m (determined under physiological salt concentrations by equilibrium binding). Proteins with lower affinity (10−5–10−7m) often require only 0.2–0.5 m NaCl to elute. This method assumes that GAG–protein interactions are entirely ionic, which is not entirely correct. Nevertheless, it can provide an assessment of relative affinity, when comparing different GAG-binding proteins.A number of more sophisticated methods are now in use that provide detailed thermodynamic data (ΔH [change in enthalpy], ΔS [change in entropy], ΔCp [change in molar heat capacity], etc.), kinetic data (association and dissociation rates), and high-resolution data on atomic contacts in GAG–protein interactions (Table 38.2). Regardless of the technique one uses, it must be kept in mind that in vitro binding measurements are not likely to be the same as those when the protein binds to proteoglycans on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix, where the density and variety of GAG-binding proteins, proteoglycans, and other interacting factors varies greatly. To determine the physiological relevance of the interaction, one should consider measuring binding under conditions that can lead to a biological response. For example, one can measure binding to cells with altered GAG composition (Chapter 49) or after treatment with specific lyases to remove GAG chains from the cell surface (Chapter 17) and then determine whether the same response occurs as observed in the presence of GAG chains. The interaction can then be studied more intensively using the in vitro assays described above.Methods to measure glycosaminoglycan (GAG)–protein interaction As mentioned above, most GAG-binding proteins interact with HS and/or heparin. The likely basis for this preference is greater sequence heterogeneity and more extensive and variable sulfation compared with other GAGs. The unusual conformational flexibility of iduronic acid, which is found in heparin, HS, and DS, also has a role in their ability to bind proteins. GAGs are linear helical structures, consisting of alternating residues of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) with glucuronic acid (GlcA) or IdoA (with the exception of KS, which consists of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and galactose residues; Chapter 17). Inspection of heparin oligosaccharides containing highly modified domains ([GlcNS6S-IdoA2S]n) shows that the N-sulfo and 2-O-sulfo groups of each disaccharide repeat lie on opposite sides of the helix from the 6-O-sulfo and carboxyl groups (Figure 38.1). Analysis of the conformation of individual sugars shows that N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid residues assume a preferred conformation in solution, designated 4C1 (indicating that carbon 4 is above the plane defined by carbons 2, 3, and 5 and the ring oxygen, and that carbon 1 is below the plane; Chapter 2). In contrast, IdoA2S assumes the 1C4 or the 2S0 conformation (Figure 38.1), which reorients the position of the sulfo substituents, thereby creating a different orientation of charged groups. In many cases when a protein binds to an HS chain, it induces a change in conformation of the IdoA2S residue resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding. IdoA2S residues have always been found in domains rich in N-sulfo and O-sulfo groups (for biosynthetic reasons; Chapter 17), which is also where proteins usually bind. Thus, the greater degree of conformational flexibility in these modified regions may explain why so many more proteins bind with high affinity to heparin, HS, and DS than to other GAGs. The presence of an N-acetyl group in an N-acetylglucosamine residue changes the preferred conformation of the neighboring IdoA residue, showing that even minor modifications can influence conformation and chain flexibility. Binding to GAGs that have a low degree of sulfation may require larger domains in the protein to interact with longer stretches of an oligosaccharide. Molecular dynamic simulations on large heparin oligosaccharides, even in the presence of proteins, are possible with recent advances in computer performance (Online Appendix 38A). Such simulations can be used to predict the conformational flexibility of different domains within the chain and, when combined with recent advances in protein–GAG docking, can provide additional insights into GAG–protein interactions.Conformation of heparin oligosaccharides. (A) Glucosamine (GlcN) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) exist in the 4C1 conformation, whereas iduronic acid (IdoA) exists in equally energetic conformations designated 1C4 and 2S0. (B) Space-filling model of a heparin (more...)The discovery of multiple GAG-binding proteins led a number of investigators to examine whether there is a consensus amino acid sequence for GAG binding. In retrospect, this strategy was overly simplistic because it assumed that all GAG-binding proteins have a common evolutionary origin and would recognize the same oligosaccharide sequence within heparin or, at least, sequences that would share many common features. It is now known that the convergently evolved GAG-binding proteins interact with different oligosaccharide sequences. The binding sites in the protein always contain basic amino acids (lysine and arginine), whose positive charges presumably interact with the negatively charged sulfates and carboxylates of the GAG chains. However, the arrangement of these basic amino acids can be quite variable, consistent with the variable positioning of sulfo groups in the GAG partner. Selectivity is also a function of H-bonding and van der Waal interactions of amino acid residues with the oligosaccharide.Most proteins are formed from α-helices, β-strands, and loops. Therefore, to engage a linear GAG chain electrostatically, the positively charged amino acid residues must align along the same side of the protein segment. α-Helices have periodicities of 3.4 residues per turn, which would require the basic residues to occur every third or fourth position along the helix to align with an oligosaccharide. In β-strands, the amino acid side chains alternate sides every other residue. Thus, to bind a GAG chain, the positively charged residues in a β-strand would be located quite differently than in an α-helix.On the basis of the structure of several heparin-binding proteins that were available in 1991, Alan Cardin and Herschel Weintraub proposed that typical heparin-binding sites had the sequence XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX, where B is lysine or arginine and X is any other amino acid. From the structural arguments provided above, it should be obvious that only some of the basic residues in these sequences could participate in GAG binding, the actual number being determined by whether the peptide sequence exists as an α-helix or a β-sheet. It is now known that the presence of these sequences in a protein merely suggests a possible interaction with heparin (or another GAG chain), but it does not prove that the interaction occurs under physiological conditions. In fact, the predicted binding sites for heparin in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) turned out to be incorrect once the crystal structure was determined. It is likely that binding involves multiple protein segments that juxtapose positively charged residues into a three-dimensional turn-rich recognition site. In many cases the binding involves loops which make the positioning more variable. An example of this phenomenon is observed in the chemokine CCL5, which contains a XBBXBX motif in a loop. The specific arrangement of residues should vary according to the type and fine structure of those oligosaccharides involved in binding.In lectins, and in antibodies that recognize glycans, the glycan recognition domains are typically shallow pockets that engage the terminal sugars of the oligosaccharide chain (Chapters 29, 30, and 37). In GAG-binding proteins, the protein usually binds to sugar residues that lie within the chain or near the terminus. Therefore, the binding sites in GAG-binding proteins consist of clefts or sets of juxtaposed surface residues rather than pockets. These GAG-binding sites on the protein surface give rise to more rapid GAG–protein binding kinetics than are typically observed for protein–protein interactions. Given that GAG chains generally exist in a helical conformation, only those residues on the face toward the protein interact with amino acid residues; the ones on the other side of the helix are potentially free to interact with a second ligand (e.g., as observed in FGF dimers). Alternatively, residues in a binding cleft could interact with both sides of the helix (e.g., in dengue envelope protein). Finally, one should keep in mind that binding occurs to only a small segment of the GAG chain. Thus, a single GAG chain can potentially bind multiple protein ligands facilitating cooperative binding that can lead to protein oligomerization (e.g., some chemokines).Perhaps the most studied example of a GAG–protein interaction is the binding of antithrombin to heparin and HS (Figure 38.2). This interaction is of great pharmacological importance because heparin is widely used clinically as an anticoagulant. Binding of antithrombin to heparin has a dual effect: first, it causes a conformational change in the protein and activation of the protease inhibiting action, resulting in a 1000-fold enhancement in the rate at which it inactivates thrombin and factor Xa. Second, the heparin chain acts as a template, enhancing the physical apposition of thrombin and antithrombin. Thus, both the protease (thrombin) and the inhibitor have GAG-binding sites. Heparin acts as a catalyst in these reactions by enhancing the rate of the reaction through apposition of substrates and conformational change. After the inactivation of thrombin or factor Xa by antithrombin occurs, the complexes lose affinity for heparin and dissociate. The heparin is then available to participate in another activation/inactivation cycle. Antithrombin is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors, many of which bind to heparin.(Top) Crystal structure of the antithrombin–pentasaccharide complex (from Protein Data Bank). Three structural elements that make contact with heparin are shown, including a loop (red), and two α-helices (in blue and magenta). The pentasaccharide (more...)Early studies using affinity fractionation schemes showed that only about one-third of the chains in a heparin preparation actually bind with high affinity to antithrombin. Comparing the sequence of the bound chains with those that did not bind failed to reveal any substantial differences in composition, consistent with the later discovery that the binding site consists of only five sugar residues (Figure 38.2) (the average heparin chain is about 50 sugar residues). Within this pentasaccharide sequence, however, a centrally located 3-O-sulfated GlcNS6S unit plays an essential role in mediating antithrombin–heparin interaction. The binding sites in GAG chains in general represent a very small segment of the chains.Crystals of antithrombin were prepared and analyzed by X-ray diffraction to 2.6-Å resolution. The docking site for the heparin pentasaccharide is formed by the apposition of two helices, which both contain critical arginine and lysine residues at the interface (Figure 38.2). The pentasaccharide is sufficient to activate antithrombin binding toward factor Xa, but it will not facilitate the inactivation of thrombin. For this to occur, a larger oligosaccharide of at least 18 residues is needed. As mentioned above, thrombin also contains a heparin-binding site, and the larger heparin oligosaccharide is thought to act as a template for the formation of a ternary complex with thrombin and antithrombin. In contrast to antithrombin, thrombin shows little oligosaccharide specificity. As might be expected, adding high concentrations of heparin actually inhibits the reaction, because the formation of binary complexes of heparin and thrombin or heparin and antithrombin predominate. This important principle of “activation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations” also occurs in other systems in which ternary complexes form.A large number of growth factors can be purified based on their affinity for heparin. The heparin-binding family of FGFs has grown to more than 22 members and includes the prototype FGF2, otherwise known as basic fibroblast growth factor. FGF2 has a very high affinity for heparin (Kd ∼ 10−9m) and requires 1.5–2 m NaCl to elute from heparin-Sepharose. FGF2 has potent mitogenic activity in cells that express one of the FGF-signaling receptors (FGFRs; four FGFR genes are known and multiple splice variants exist). Cell-surface HS binds to both FGF2 and FGFR, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex. Both binding and the mitogenic response are greatly stimulated by heparin or HS, which promotes dimerization of the ligand–receptor complex.The costimulatory role of HS (and heparin) in this system is reminiscent of the heparin/antithrombin/thrombin story. Indeed, the minimal binding sequence for FGF2 also consists of a pentasaccharide. However, this pentasaccharide is not sufficient to trigger a biological response (mitogenesis). For this to occur, a longer oligosaccharide (10-mer) containing the minimal sequence and additional 6-O-sulfo groups are needed to bind FGFR. The sequence that binds to both FGF2 and FGFR is prevalent in heparin but rare in HS. The requirement for this rare binding sequence reduces the probability of finding this particular arrangement in naturally occurring HS chains. Thus, some preparations of HS are inactive in mitogenesis, and those containing only one-half of the bipartite binding sequence are actually inhibitory.The structure of FGF2 co-crystallized with a heparin hexasaccharide has since been obtained (Figure 38.3). The heparin fragment ([GlcNS6Sα1-4IdoA2Sα1-4]3) was helical and bound to a turn-rich heparin-binding site on the surface of FGF2. Only one N-sulfo group and the 2-O-sulfo group from the adjacent iduronic acid are bound to the growth factor in the turn-rich binding domain, and the next GlcNS residue is bound to a second site, consistent with the minimal binding sequence determined with oligosaccharide fragments. Unlike antithrombin–heparin interaction, no significant conformational change in FGF2 occurs on heparin binding. The crystal structure of acidic FGF (FGF1) has also been solved and shows similar sequences on its surface. However, the oligosaccharide sequence that binds with high affinity to FGF1 contains 6-O-sulfo groups.Crystal and solution structures of GAG–protein complexes. (A) Crystal structure of the FGF2–hexasaccharide complex (PDB: 1BFC). Key interactions between the hexasaccharide and FGF2 are shown in black dotted lines. The hexasaccharide is (more...)The cocrystal structure of the complex of (FGF2-FGFR)2, first solved in the absence of heparin/HS ligand, showed a canyon of positively charged amino acid residues, suggestive of an unoccupied heparin-binding site. Subsequently, the heparin–oligosaccharide-containing complex was solved after introduction of heparin oligosaccharides, suggesting a 2:2:2 complex of FGF2:FGFR1:HS (Figure 38.3). Another important feature of this complex is the orientation of the nonreducing ends of the HS chains that terminate in an N-sulfoglucosamine residue, which arises by endolytic cleavage of chains by the enzyme heparanase (Chapter 17). The structure of the FGF1–FGFR2–HS complex is not without controversy; structural analysis of complexes formed in solution and purified by gel filtration has suggested a very different structure consisting of a 2:2:1 complex (Figure 38.3).Chemokines are another class of proteins exhibiting strong interactions with GAGs. However, these interactions do not directly affect activities of inhibitors or signaling molecules as in previous examples. Instead, they stabilize chemotactic gradients of chemokines; these gradients, in turn, direct leukocytes to sites of injury or infection. They may also facilitate cell migration through the endothelial layer of the blood vessels in which they circulate. This is no easy task; blood is flowing rapidly in these vessels and would easily destroy gradients in the absence of these interactions. CCL5, also called RANTES, is a member of a chemokine subclass that has two adjacent cysteines (CC) near its amino terminus. It is among the earliest discovered and among the most studied of the chemokines. CCL5 binds both HS and CS; but given the abundance of CS chains in normal plasma and the association of CS proteoglycans with vascular development and disease, a specific discussion of CCL5–CS interactions seems appropriate.Although CCL5 is a small protein (∼8 kDa), it exists primarily as dimers (Kd<1 µM) that assemble into larger filamentous structures, especially in the presence of GAGs. These characteristics have made it difficult to study CCL5 structurally. Most studies have involved a mutated form (E66S) and/or study at lower pH—conditions that limit oligomerization to a dimer. Nevertheless, complementary solution data, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have allowed construction of filament models, both with and without GAGs present. Figure 38.3D shows a model of a tetramer built on the known dimer structure (PDB id, 1U4L) and complexed with CS hexamers 4-O-sulfated on all three N-acetylgalactosamine residues of the GlcAβ1-3GalNAc repeats. Individual dimers are shown as green and sea green ribbons. Additional dimers can be added to each end to build a filament structure.The interactions between protein residues and charged groups on the CS involve a classic BBXB motif (R44, K45, N46, R47) plus a more remote arginine (R17). Each positively charged arginine is positioned to have strong electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the negatively charged carboxylate of a glucuronic acid residue and 4-O-sulfo group of the following N-acetylgalactosamine residue. The positioning of these arginine residues may be unique to CS, and other GAG segments may bind quite differently. The model of the filament in Figure 38.3D is also not unique, and both positioning of dimeric subunits and flexibility in CS binding geometry may allow longer GAG chains to cross-link adjacent dimers and facilitate oligomerization. A final point of note is that the groups responsible for interaction with the CCR5 receptor on leukocytes are near the amino terminus, a segment deeply buried in the dimer interface. These groups may be transiently exposed on filament dissociation to release monomers or they may be more permanently exposed on filament ends. Much additional structural work will be required to fully understand the function of CCL5.In some cases, the interaction of GAG chains with proteins may depend on metal cofactors. For example, L- and P-selectins have been shown to bind to a subfraction of HS chains and heparin in a divalent-cation-dependent manner. This observation raises the possibility that other examples of cation-dependent interactions with GAG chains may exist. Indeed, annexin A2 and annexin V have been shown to bind HS in a calcium-dependent manner. The co-crystal structures of annexin A2 and annexin V with heparin oligosaccharides revealed that calcium ions can either directly or indirectly (through sequestered water) participate in the interactions with HS. Another example is calcium-dependent interaction between cytokine S100A12 and HS. In this case, formation of the functional HS-binding site requires a calcium-induced conformational change of S100A12.Although the vast majority of GAG–protein interactions were identified and studied under neutral pH, quite a few GAG-binding proteins have been shown to interact with GAG only under acidic pH. Such proteins include histidine-rich glycoproteins, cystatin-C, selenoprotein P, and serum amyloid A. There is good reason to believe that the interactions between these proteins and GAG are physiologically relevant because extracellular environments with acidic pH exist under many physiological and pathological conditions. In fact, for these proteins, pH change essentially functions as an on/off switch of their interactions with GAG, which might bear physiological significances. Not surprisingly, histidines are often found in the GAG-binding site of these proteins because of its pH-dependent protonation of the imidazole ring.A main technical challenge to understand GAG–protein interactions is to dissect the essential structural elements of GAGs that contribute to the binding. Unlike researchers studying DNA-binding proteins who have access to all possible DNA sequences, researchers studying GAG-binding proteins traditionally do not have access to GAG oligosaccharides with defined structures. Fortunately, this situation has begun to change in the last 5 years. With the rapid progress of chemoenzymatic and chemical synthesis (or a combination of both) of HS/CS oligosaccharides, a growing number of structural defined oligosaccharides (dp4-dp20) have become available. Many of the oligosaccharides have been used to generate microarrays for rapid determination of structural preference of GAG-binding proteins. Although we have not yet reached a stage at which we can freely design any GAG structures that we wish, the current technology can already provide a surprisingly large array of structures for structure–function studies of GAG-binding proteins.With more than 500 GAG-binding proteins already identified (and still counting), we cannot help contemplating how this huge GAG interactome really functions at the system level. It is obvious that in any cellular environment, if one GAG-binding protein is found, it is likely that many more GAG-binding proteins are present as well. Do these GAG-binding proteins live in harmony, or are they in constant conflict by competing for binding to GAGs? When one GAG-binding protein is down-regulated, how would other GAG-binding proteins respond to this sudden availability of the free GAG-binding sites? Addressing these questions requires a systems biology approach, which has become possible with the recent increase in information about individual GAG–protein interactions. Given that spatiotemporal changes of GAG structure have profound impacts on the physiological processes associated with GAG-binding proteins, it would be natural to study this question using a systems biology approach.The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Ryan Porell, Ulf Lindahl, and So Young Kim.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.39Tadashi Suzuki, Richard D. Cummings, Markus Aebi, and Armando Parodi.N-Glycans affect glycoprotein folding because of their hydrophilic nature. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the processing of N-glycans yields a series of truncated N-glycans that serve as checkpoints that dictate the life or death of many newly made membrane and secreted proteins. Other glycan modifications also may affect glycoprotein folding in the ER. This chapter describes glycan-mediated quality-control processes in the ER and Golgi apparatus and what happens to glycoproteins that fail their “final folding examination.”During protein synthesis, nascent polypeptides begin to assume their final three-dimensional conformation by passing through folding intermediates dictated, to a large extent, by their primary sequence. Proper folding involves the formation of secondary structures (α-helices and β-strands), burying of hydrophobic residues in the interior of the protein, the formation of disulfide bonds, and quaternary associations via oligomerization or multimerization. Together, these processes prevent unwanted protein aggregation that would interfere with protein functions. To make folding more efficient, cells use various chaperones. Two major cytoplasmic chaperone families consist of heat-shock proteins in the hsp60 and hsp70 gene families that bind to exposed hydrophobic domains on misfolded proteins and maintain their solubility as they acquire their final conformation. They also participate in the repair of damaged proteins and proteins that have not properly multimerized. Improperly folded proteins that fail to mature are eventually tagged by ubiquitination, which then leads to degradation by the proteasome.Membrane proteins and proteins destined for secretion also undergo quality control during folding. Membrane and secretory proteins originate on membrane-bound ribosomes; translation and translocation into the lumen of the ER occur simultaneously in most cases. However, certain proteins are fully synthesized in the cytosol and translocated into the ER lumen posttranslationally. This latter process is more relevant in yeast than mammalian cells. The ER lumen is highly specialized for protein folding: Its oxidizing environment promotes disulfide bond formation and it is the main cellular reservoir of Ca++. To aid proper folding, a battery of molecular chaperones is present, including BiP/Grp78 (a glucose-regulated protein and member of the hsp70 family of chaperones), Grp94, and Grp170. In addition, the ER contains enzymes that promote proline cis–trans isomerization and protein disulfide bond formation, such as protein disulfide isomerases (PDI and ERp57, ERp59, and ERp72). The expression of many of these proteins increases during stress responses.Unlike cytoplasmic proteins, most membrane and secreted proteins undergo modification with N-glycans (Figure 39.1) as they enter the ER lumen. Oligosaccharyltransferase requires flexible domains of a polypeptide for glycosylation, and thus N-glycosylation evolved in eukaryotes to occur before protein folding. Accordingly, N-linked glycans affect the folding of glycoproteins directly by altering the biophysical properties of the protein. They can serve as signals to localize the folding machinery and to signal the folding status of the polypeptide. To achieve glycan-mediated folding, N-glycans are recognized by two lectin-like chaperones in the ER: calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These specialized chaperones require Ca++ for activity and bind to monoglucosylated forms of N-glycans, thus retaining the protein in the ER until proper folding occurs. The ER also contains three enzymes central to the process: α-glucosidases I and II (GI and GII), which trim glucose (Glc) from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 initially transferred to the protein and release the glycoprotein from CNX/CRT. The enzyme UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) reglucosylates the N-glycan if proper folding has not occurred. Glycoproteins that fail to fold, or to oligomerize properly, are marked with specific truncated N-glycans, and eventually retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm in which they are destroyed by N-deglycosylation and proteasomal degradation, a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). There are several ERAD pathways, which are described in the following sections.Mature N-glycan. Lettering (a–n) follows the order of addition of monosaccharides in the synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (Chapter 9). α-Glucosidase I (GI) removes residue n, and α-glucosidase II (GII) removes residues (more...)N-Glycosylation in the ER is considerably different from other types of glycosylation. It begins with the “en bloc” transfer of a 14-monosaccharide glycan to the polypeptide as it exits the translocon complex (Chapter 9). In vertebrates, addition of the N-glycan occurs on incompletely folded polypeptides. In bacteria, N-glycosylation can occur both on nascent polypeptides and on fully mature proteins (Chapter 21). N-Glycans modify the physical properties of glycoproteins by providing noncharged, bulky, hydrophilic groups that keep the protein in solution during folding. They also modulate protein conformation by forcing amino acids near the N-glycan into a hydrophilic environment.N-Glycan processing starts immediately after transfer of the precursor sugar chain to the protein in the lumen of the ER. GI removes the terminal α1-2Glc and GII then removes both α1-3Glc units (Figure 39.1). Although GII may remove the second Glc (designated m in Figure 39.1) from glycoproteins with a single N-glycan, the trimming of the second Glc occurs more efficiently when there is a second N-glycan on the same protein. Depending on cell type, a variable number of Man residues may also be removed while glycoproteins remain in the ER. GII is an ER-soluble, heterodimeric protein. Its 100- to 110-kDa α-subunit contains the catalytic activity, whereas the 50- to 60-kDa β-subunit displays a canonical ER retention/retrieval sequence (XDEL), which is partially responsible for the subcellular location of the whole enzyme. The carboxy-terminal portion of the β-subunit contains a mannose receptor homologous (MRH) domain that is homologous to the domain in the Golgi mannose 6-phosphate receptor responsible for recognizing lysosomal enzymes and for their delivery to lysosomes (Chapters 9 and 33). The affinity of the GII MRH domain is higher for the Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) N-glycan and decreases for truncated N-glycans. Consequently, the GII activity toward N-glycans diminishes for truncated N-glycans created by ER mannosidases.CNX and CRT bind to glycoproteins containing a single α1–3Glc residue (Figure 39.2). CNX is a type I transmembrane protein and CRT is soluble, but both have ER retention/retrieval signals at their carboxyl terminus, retaining them in the ER. They have structurally similar lectin domains and comprise part of a large, weakly associated heterogeneous protein network that includes BiP/Grp78, ERp57, Grp94, and other ER-resident proteins that assist protein folding. Thereby, they act as interpreters of the N-glycan code to localize the folding machinery to a glycoprotein substrate. Both CNX and CRT are monovalent, low-affinity lectins for monoglucosylated, oligomannosyl N-glycans, but because of their different membrane-bound or soluble status within the ER lumen, their in vivo specificities are not identical. CNX mainly interacts with N-glycans close to the ER membrane, whereas CRT binds preferentially to glycoproteins in the ER lumen or to those that have large luminal domains. Binding of incompletely folded glycoproteins to the CNX/CRT complex prevents their exit from the ER and enhances folding efficiency by preventing aggregation and premature oligomerization/degradation and by facilitating the formation of native disulfide bonds. This latter task is performed by ERp57, a CNX/CRT-associated oxidoreductase. CNX and CRT are, therefore, unconventional chaperones that do not directly recognize protein moieties of folding intermediates like conventional chaperones, but rather they recognize particular N-glycans in the folding intermediates.Model of quality control in glycoprotein folding. Proteins entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are N-glycosylated by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) as they emerge from the translocon (SEC61) (1). Two glucose (Glc) residues are removed by the (more...)Removal of the final Glc residue from N-glycans by GII prevents binding of the protein to CNX/CRT. If properly folded, these glycoproteins are packaged into COPII-coated vesicles and transferred to the Golgi (Figure 39.2). However, if they remain unfolded, UGGT adds a single α1–3Glc to the glycan, thus recreating the identical N-glycan first recognized by CNX/CRT. Therefore, UGGT has the remarkable property of exclusively glucosylating glycoproteins that display a nonnative conformation. UGGT discriminates between different nonnative conformers, and preferentially glucosylates glycoproteins in their last stages of folding when they are displaying exposed hydrophobic amino acid patches (molten globules). In vitro, the enzyme also recognizes N-glycans linked to relatively short hydrophobic peptides or to hydrophobic aglycones, although less efficiently. Contrary to BiP/Grp78 that preferentially binds extended hydrophobic “sequences,” UGGT recognizes hydrophobic “surfaces.” This difference determines that glycoproteins are first recognized by chaperones like BiP/Grp78 and only later, at final folding stages, are epitopes created by UGGT recognized by CNX/CRT. UGGT modifies N-glycans located in the relative vicinity of amino acids that prevent rapid folding of a glycoprotein.UGGT also glucosylates incompletely assembled multimeric complexes of fully mature monomers because it recognizes hydrophobic surfaces exposed in the absence of the appropriate subunits. UGGT is a relatively large, soluble, ER protein (150- to 170-kDa) that uses UDP-Glc as sugar donor and requires millimolar Ca++ concentrations, typically found within the ER lumen. UGGT has at least two domains. The amino-terminal one, comprising ∼80% of the molecule, recognizes abnormal protein conformers. This domain contains three tandemly repeated, thioredoxin-like domains that are frequently found in ER proteins involved in protein folding and quality-control processes. A crystal structure of the third domain showed that it contains a large hydrophobic patch hidden by a flexible carboxy-terminal helix. The carboxy-terminal domain has homology with other glycosyltransferases and is responsible for the catalytic activity.Together, UGGT and the CNX/CRT complex ensure that only properly folded and multimerized glycoproteins move from the ER to the Golgi. Unlike GII, the activity of UGGT does not decrease on reduction of N-glycan Man content. Therefore, ER α-mannosidase catalyzed removal of Man from N-glycans results in longer half-lives of UGGT reaction products that may be recognized by CNX/CRT. It is possible that the differential activities of UGGT and GII toward N-glycans with reduced Man content provides glycoproteins with a last opportunity to achieve proper folding before proteasomal degradation. The ER folding and quality-control process is not foolproof, however. Some misfolded proteins escape the ER and others may misfold after they exit. Thus, there are additional checkpoints to correct mistakes that occur later in the secretory pathway.ER–Golgi intermediate compartment 53 (ERGIC53) is a type I membrane protein that binds to oligomannosyl N-glycans in a Ca++-dependent manner. Its luminal, carbohydrate-binding domain is similar to those of soluble lectins from leguminous plants. ERGIC53 cycles between the ER and the ERGIC. The mammalian protein contains both ER-targeting (dilysine) and ER-exit (diphenylalanine) determinants at its carboxyl terminus, which bind, respectively, to COPI and COPII coatomers involved in trafficking between the ER and Golgi. ERGIC53 loads a subset of glycoproteins (coagulation factors V and VIII and cathepsins C and Z) into COPII-coated vesicles leaving the ER for the Golgi. Mutation of ERGIC53 causes combined factor V and VIII deficiency, indicating an important role in secretion of these, and probably other glycoproteins. Vesicular integral protein 36 (VIP36) is another Golgi lectin that also binds glycoproteins containing oligomannosyl N-glycans. VIP36 may facilitate transport of glycoproteins from the ERGIC to cis-Golgi cisternae, or retrieve glycoproteins bearing N-glycans that did not undergo conversion to Man5GlcNAc2 by cis-Golgi α-mannosidases IA, IB, and/or IC. Conceivably, this would provide an opportunity for new rounds of trimming and eventual formation of complex N-glycans. Both ERGIC53 and VIP36 are up-regulated as part of the unfolded protein response. Whether other lectins recognizing specific glycans are involved in post-ER quality control is still an open question.Despite the presence of a battery of classical chaperones and the CNX/CRT/UGGT cycle in the ER, the process of glycoprotein folding is relatively inefficient, with as much as 80% of some newly made proteins never maturing. How do cells distinguish between misfolded glycoproteins and folding intermediates if both entities have almost identical structural features such as exposed hydrophobic patches? How do cells pull glycoproteins destined for degradation out from futile reglucosylation–deglucosylation cycles if those glycoproteins are indeed very efficiently glucosylated by UGGT? How are terminally misfolded glycoproteins driven to the proteasome for degradation? The key discriminating factor appears to be the structure of the truncated N-glycans that result from the relatively long stay of a misfolded glycoprotein in the ER lumen.Mammalian cells have, in addition to Man1B1, three additional homologs called EDEMs (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like) proteins, which initially were thought to be devoid of activity. However, when either Man1B1 or the EDEMs were individually knocked out in human or chicken cells, conversion of M9 to M8B (Figure 39.2) was mainly performed by EDEM2, and the contribution of Man1B1 to that particular demannosylation step was minimal. On the other hand, conversion of M8B to M7 lacking residues i and k (M7BC; Figure 39.1) was performed by EDEMs 1 and 3. Recent evidence suggests that Man1B1, initially considered as ER mannosidase I, localizes to Golgi, and appears to work as a backup enzyme to cleave off residue i in the Golgi as this residue is rather resistant to the action of Golgi α-mannosidase I. The M7BC isomer exposes an α1–6Man (residue j; Figure 39.1), which is specifically recognized by an ER lectin (OS9 in mammals and Yos9p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Like GII, this lectin also contains an MRH domain that binds N-glycans smaller than M9, including M7BC. OS9/Yos9p forms part of the complex that translocates misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol (ERAD-L; see below). Both the conversion of M9 to M8B and the conversion of M8B to M7BC are slow processes in mammalian cells when compared with deglucosylation reactions. This affords two checkpoints ensuring that only misfolded glycoproteins, and not folding intermediates, are driven toward proteasomal degradation after a relatively long ER residence. In yeast, only an ER α-mannosidase and one EDEM-like protein called Htm1p are present. The former transforms M9 to M8B very rapidly in practically all glycoproteins, whereas the latter converts M8B to M7BC slowly, thus affording only one checkpoint for the exclusive degradation of terminally misfolded glycoproteins. Htm1p forms a complex with PDI. More recent evidence further suggests that mammalian EDEMs act as active α-mannosidases forming complexes with distinct oxidoreductases. In the case of yeast the oxidoreductase-Htm1p association enhances the α-mannosidase activity of the latter and the complex participates in the recognition of ERAD substrates. However, not all glycoproteins with N-glycans terminating in α1–6Man are driven to degradation. For instance, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl acetyl-coenzyme-A reductase, a key ER enzyme in sterol biosynthesis, carries Man5GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 N-glycans that do not target it for degradation (see below).Retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ultimately depends on various protein complexes, some of which contain integral ER membrane proteins. ER membrane proteins with folding defects in the cytosolic domain are extracted from the ER membrane by the Doa10 complex via ERAD-C, whereas those in which the folding defect is present in the luminal (ERAD-L) or membrane (ERAD-M) domains use the Hrd1 complex. Both Doa10p and Hrd1p are integral membrane proteins with E3 ligase activity in their cytosolic portion. Other proteins in these complexes include chaperones, proteins with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity or proteins that recognize misfolded proteins. For instance, glycoproteins with N-glycans containing a terminal α1–6Man are bound by Yos9p and undergo ERAD only if the N-glycans are in unstructured protein, a feature recognized by Hrd3p in the Hrd1 complex. Finally, proteins common to both complexes such as yeast Cdc48 (p97 in mammals) are responsible for membrane extraction of misfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Although the pore by which ERAD-L substrates are actually transported to the cytosol has not been identified, it is known that the substrates must be unfolded in the ER lumen. Although studies on ERAD complexes have been mainly performed in S. cerevisiae, mammalian cells have homologs of nearly all proteins described in the yeast complexes.N-Glycans are removed from unfolded glycoproteins during proteasomal degradation. A cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, N-glycanase, NGLY1) plays an important role in both removing the glycan and constructing an efficient predegradation complex (Figure 39.3). NGLY1 recognizes only misfolded or denatured glycoproteins. The enzyme is bound to the proteasome by subunits S4 and HR23B as a complex with Cdc48, a component of ERAD complexes. Degradation of the released N-glycan occurs in two stages. First, cleavage occurs between the two GlcNAcs (chitobiose) in the core of the N-glycan via a cytoplasmic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. A cytoplasmic α-mannosidase cleaves up to four Man residues to generate Man5GlcNAc (Man c, d, e, f, and g in Figure 39.1). This glycan is then taken into the lysosome via an ATP-dependent lysosomal membrane transporter for final degradation to monosaccharides. Whether these free glycans have any function in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment before they are degraded has not been investigated.Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytoplasm, and lysosomes. Specific pathways exist for the degradation of free glycans released from misfolded glycoproteins and glycopeptides generated within the ER. Dolichol-linked (more...)Protein O-fucosyltransferases (Ofut1 in Drosophila; POFUT1 and POFUT2 in mammals) are soluble ER enzymes that O-fucosylate Ser/Thr residues. Ofut1 and POFUT1 add fucose to epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like repeats, whereas POFUT2 adds fucose to thrombospondin (TSR) type 1–like repeats (Chapter 13). EGF and TSR domains are present as tandem repeats in numerous proteins of multicellular organisms. Ofut1/POFUT1 and POFUT2 selectively fucosylate only properly folded protein domains, suggesting a role of this glycosylation in folding quality control. Indeed, several POFUT2 targets including ADAMTSL1 and ADAMTSL2 (scaffolding proteins in the extracellular matrix), ADAMTS9 (a matrix remodeling protease), and ADAMTS13 (the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease) strictly require O-fucosylation for efficient secretion. Indeed, O-fucosylation appears to stabilize folded TSRs. The case of Ofut1/POFUT1 is a bit more ambiguous. Studies performed in Drosophila on the efficiency of cell-surface expression of the Ofut1 substrate Notch showed that Ofut1 is required as a chaperone for Notch folding and cell-surface expression, and that chaperone activity is largely independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity. In contrast, POFUT1 does not appear to be absolutely required for cell-surface expression of Notch receptors in all mammalian cells, suggesting that cell-specific chaperones may be able to compensate for loss of POFUT1 in certain contexts. It has been reported recently that O-mannosylation in S. cerevisiae ER might be responsible for terminating futile cycles of association–dissociation between proteins unable to attain their native conformation and Kar2p (the budding yeast homolog of mammalian BiP/Grp78 chaperone).The loss of CNX and CRT in most multicellular organisms causes a severe phenotype. Mice deficient in CNX reach full term, but half die within 2 days of birth, and very few survive beyond 3 months. The runts that survive have obvious motor disorders with loss of large myelinated nerve fibers. CRT-deficient mice and ERp57-null mice also show embryonic lethality. In contrast, CNX and CRT null Caenorhabditis elegans mutants are viable. Yeast has CNX or CNX-like lectins (but not CRT), whereas trypanosomatid protozoa have only CRT. Another important conserved mammalian ER lectin resident is calmegin, expressed only in the testes during spermatogenesis. Calmegin shares ∼60% homology with CNX in mice. Mice deficient in calmegin are nearly sterile despite producing normal-looking sperm. The sperm are defective in migration into the oviducts and they do not adhere to the zona pellucida. UGGT is absent from S. cerevisiae but not from Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. The enzyme is not required for the viability of the fission yeast or single mammalian cells grown under normal conditions. The enzyme is also dispensable for growth of some multicellular organisms, such as plants. However, loss of UGGT is embryonically lethal in mice. This fact, as well of the strict requirement of UGGT for the viability of S. pombe cells only when grown under severe ER stress conditions, point to a restricted set of glycoproteins absolutely requiring UGGT for proper folding.In addition to combined factor V and VIII deficiency caused by ERGIC53 mutations (see above), other congenital diseases result in retention of defective proteins in the ER and their eventual proteasomal degradation. For instance, the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, CFTR-ΔF508, leads to improper folding of this chloride channel and its retention in the ER. Importantly, the mutation affects CFTR transit to the plasma membrane but not its transport activity. Similarly, UGGT recognition of a brassinosteroid receptor mutant triggers retention in the ER of Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Thus, certain diseases caused by ER retention of defective glycoproteins might be ameliorated by inhibitors of UGGT activity. One beautiful example of how the fine sensitivity of UGGT allows modulation of basic physiological processes is its role during antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I). Here, MHC I complexes loaded with suboptimal peptides are recognized by UGGT, thus triggering their retention in the ER. On the contrary, complexes formed with high-affinity peptides are poor UGGT substrates and are able to be presented on the cell surface. Many congenital diseases such as lysosomal storage diseases also result in the accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER, thus overloading the folding machinery. An estimated 20%–30% of normal proteins misfold, so it is not surprising that small differences in the kinetics of conformational maturation and degradation can tip the balance to ERAD for lack of sufficient chaperones and other factors that facilitate folding.Although most glycoproteins transiently associate with CNX/CRT during their maturation in the ER in vivo, other ER folding and quality-control mechanisms do the job quite efficiently in cultured cells. However, viral glycoproteins such as vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, HIV glycoprotein gp120, and M protein from hepatitis B virus, absolutely require CNX/CRT for proper folding and exit from the ER. Several viruses use components of the ERAD machinery to evade immune surveillance in the host. For instance, cytomegalovirus proteins bind to MHC I complexes and deliver them to E3 ligase complexes that result in their eventual proteasomal degradation. Similarly, expression of HIV ER protein Vpu results in the proteasomal degradation of CD4. SV40 and proteins such as cholera toxin are retrotranslocated to the ER through the secretory pathway where they use some ERAD components to reach the cytosol where they produce deleterious effects.The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

Hahn, and Jeffrey D. Esko.There has been a growing recognition that free glycans are used as signals for the initiation of a wide variety of biological processes. Such signaling events are found in development and defense responses of plants and animals and in interactions of organisms with one another. This chapter covers the current information on this field of study.Glycan signaling systems are diverse. Sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) may be used by sensing systems, which are typically linked with the metabolism of the sugar, and form complex webs of signaling events linked to hormones. Glycan-signaling systems also involve various glycoconjugates. The addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins results in changes in the cytoskeleton, gene transcription, and enzyme activation (Chapter 19). Glycosphingolipids may form lipid rafts, which act as a platform for sequestering signaling receptors or can associate with receptor tyrosine kinases and modulate their activity (Chapter 11). Membrane proteoglycans containing sulfated glycosaminoglycans—including syndecans, glypicans, and phosphacan—may act as signaling molecules by interacting with kinases or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Chapters 17 and 38). Most plasma membrane signaling receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors, contain N-glycans and O-glycans that modulate their stability and activity (Chapters 9 and 10). Binding of galectins to these glycans (Chapter 36) or removal of sialic acids by cell-surface sialidases (Chapter 15) is also thought to modulate signaling. These and other signaling processes are described elsewhere in this book and are not discussed further here.There is increasing evidence that low concentrations of specific free glycans are signals that initiate numerous biological processes. The first evidence for such signals was obtained during studies of defense responses in plants. Subsequently, glycan perception and signaling have been shown to be important in plant and animal development, in innate immunity, and in the initiation of the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium–legume symbiosis. The glycans that function as signals have been identified in many of these processes and have been given the generic term “oligosaccharins,” regardless of their species of origin or the biological process(es) in which they participate. In contrast, only a few of the receptors and mechanisms of signal transduction have been identified and characterized.Plants have several surveillance and defensive systems to control infection by pathogens. One of these systems shows similarities with the mammalian innate immune system and consists of plasma membrane-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that trigger defense responses upon perception of specific molecules by their extracellular ectodomains (ECDs). These ECDs can bind nonself molecules derived from pathogens (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) or self-compounds that are released from plant cells or synthesized on infection by pathogens (named generically damage-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs; Figure 40.1). Among the molecules perceived by PRRs are glycans (oligosaccharides) released from microbial and plant cell wall polysaccharides by hydrolytic enzymes originating from the plant or the pathogen. On binding of a ligand by its specific PRR, a PRR coreceptor is often recruited to form a protein complex, which leads to the activation of the receptor\\'s cytoplasmic kinase domain and the initiation of defense responses. Defense response signaling can involve changes in ion flux across the plasma membrane (including a cytoplasmic Ca++ burst), the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidases (RBOHs), the phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated and calcium-dependent protein kinases (MPKs and CDPKs, respectively) and the up-regulation of defense-associated genes (Figure 40.1). These defense responses can lead to changes in the plant cell wall, the production of glycanases that fragment the pathogen\\'s cell wall, and the synthesis of metabolites (phytoalexins) and antimicrobial proteins/peptides that inhibit pathogen growth. These defense responses often lead to localized cell death in the plant tissue, which is visible as necrotic spots at the site of infection and limits the pathogen\\'s spread. Of the vast number of ligands that ECD-PRRs can perceive, those composed of carbohydrate moieties are poorly studied. Only a limited number of PRR/glycan pairs have been identified and their triggered defense responses characterized. There is evidence for some similarities between the plant defense responses and animal innate immune system, most notably where specific pattern recognition occurs (Chapter 42).Plant defense responses upon glycan perception by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). These responses are initiated by a glycan generated by glycanases that fragment either the pathogen cell walls or the plant cell walls. The glycan interacts with specific (more...)Early studies showed that oligosaccharides derived from cell wall glycans of the plant or the pathogen elicit numerous plant defense responses at nanomolar/micromolar concentrations. Oligogalacturonides composed of 1-4-linked α-GalA residues are one example of oligosaccharins released from plant cell wall polysaccharides, in this specific case from homogalacturonans by endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) secreted by the pathogen. The activities of such pathogen-derived EPGs are frequently inhibited or modulated by polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIP) produced by plants. Similarly, oligoglucosides composed of 1-6- and 1-3-linked β-Glc residues released from the mycelial walls of the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae by plant endo-glucanases were an early example of oligosaccharins generated from a pathogen\\'s cell wall.Other pathogen-derived oligosaccharins are the PAMPs derived from linear homo-oligomers from fungal/oomycete cell walls that include chitin [1,4-β-D-(GlcNAc)n], and its deacetylated form (chitosan), and β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2). More recently, additional plant cell wall–derived oligosaccharins have been shown to trigger defense responses, including cellulose-derived oligomers (β-1,4-glucans), mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs: β-1,4/β-1,3 glucans), and oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucans, mannans, xylans, or callose, which trigger signaling cascades in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including crops (Figure 40.2). It has recently been shown that at least some “self” immune-active plant glycans are released in a regulated manner as part of normal plant developmental pathways and are not necessarily tied to cell-wall damage pathways (see below). It is also noteworthy that some immune-active oligosaccharides can be released from polymers present in the walls of both the pathogen and the plant. For example, β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides are released from callose, which is produced by plants and is also a component of many fungal and oomycete cell walls. Similarly, β-1,4-glucan oligosaccharides are released from cellulose that is present in the cell walls of plants and some oomycetes.Oligosaccharins that are active in plants. Examples of oligosaccharides derived from fungal, oomycete, and plant cell walls are shown. The degree of polymerization (DP) of the minimally active oligosaccharide structures triggering some responses in plants (more...)The composition (monosaccharide units), degree of polymerization (DP), and branching of the oligosaccharins determine their biological activity in triggering plant defense. For example, oligogalacturonides that are biologically active typically require a DP of 10–14 for activity, whereas DPs of >7 and >4 are necessary for the oligochitosans and oligochitins, respectively (Figure 40.2). A single active hepta-glucoside from oomycete walls was isolated from a mixture of approximately 300 inactive structural isomers and found to trigger defense responses in soybean. Both the DP and location of the β-1-3 branches in this oligosaccharide are important for its biological activity (Figure 40.2). Elongating the oligosaccharide at the reducing end had no discernible effect on bioactivity and activity was also largely retained by removal of a single glucose from the reducing end. However, the hexa-glucoside was the minimal structure of this oligosaccharide that had appreciable activity in inducing defense responses in soybean.The low quantities and different types of glycan signal molecules that elicit defense responses suggest that these glycans are recognized by specific plasma membrane-localized receptors. A 75-kDa plasma membrane protein with high-binding affinity for chitin elicitors was identified in rice cell plasma membranes and proposed to be involved in oligosaccharide perception and signal transduction. This rice chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP) contains a lysozyme motif (LysM) on its ECD and no appreciable portion of the protein on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Similarly, a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase (CERK1) with a LysM-ECD is required for chitin-induced signaling in Arabidopsis. In both rice and Arabidopsis, the perception of chito-oligosaccharins involves an additional LysM-containing receptor, CERK1 and LYK5, respectively (Figure 40.2). A similar situation has been shown to exist in legumes (Medicago), which requires LYK9 (a AtCERK1 homolog) and LYR4 (a AtLYK5 homolog) for chito-oligosaccharide (DP=8) activation of defense signaling. Members of the LysM family of Arabidopsis are also involved, probably as coreceptors, in the perception of β-1,3-glucan and β-1,4/β-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides. Recognition of pectin-derived oligogalacturonides in Arabidopsis involves wall-associated receptor-like kinases (WAKs; WAK1) that have an ECD with similarities to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of mammals. Reducing or impairing expression of genes encoding these receptors in plants by RNA interference (RNAi) or mutation results in suppression of defense responses.The interaction between Rhizobium and the roots of legumes is an agriculturally and economically important symbiotic relationship because it enables the plant to fix atmospheric nitrogen. An early step in this process is the plant\\'s recognition of lipooligosaccharide signals (Nod factors), which are produced by the bacteria (Figure 40.3). Nod factors have a chitin oligosaccharide backbone containing from three to five GlcNAc residues. However, the types of modifications of this backbone, which include methylation, acylation (typically with a C16 or C18 fatty acid), acetylation, carbamylation, sulfation, glycosylation, and the addition of glycerol, differ among Rhizobium strains.Generic structure of a Nod factor. Sites on the molecule where species-specific modifications can occur are designated by R1–R7. R1 = H or methyl; R2 = C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:3, C18:4, C20:3, or C20:4; R3 = H, carbamate; R4 = H, carbamate; R5 (more...)Nod factors are effective at subnanomolar concentrations, are host-specific, and stimulate numerous changes in the plant\\'s root hairs and roots that allow the bacteria to enter the root cortex and induce the formation of nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs. The initiation of nodule formation and Rhizobium entry into the root are host strain–specific; this specificity is determined by the structure of the Nod factor produced by a particular Rhizobium strain and the ability of a leguminous species to recognize that signal.Genetic and biochemical approaches have been used to identify potential plant root Nod factor receptors and proteins involved in the signaling events. The putative receptors are transmembrane proteins with a serine/threonine receptor kinase motif on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and LysM domains that may recognize Nod factors on the exterior of the membrane. Two receptors (NFR5 and NFR1) have been reported to bind Nod factor directly at high-affinity binding sites, although only limited carbohydrate-binding studies were conducted. A lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolase (LNP) has been identified in legume roots and reported to bind Nod factors from Rhizobium symbionts of the plant species from which it was obtained. LNP is a peripheral membrane protein that may function in a receptor complex with one or more LysM-type proteins or act downstream of the Nod factor receptors.Rhizobium exopolysaccharides (EPS) also have important roles in the development of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. A root receptor–like kinase (EPR3) has been identified and shown to have a role in the recognition of the bacterial EPS. Thus, receptor-mediated recognition of Nod factors and EPS signals may be involved in plant-bacterial compatibility and bacterial access to legume roots.Several glycans have been shown to affect plant growth and plant organogenesis. Nanomolar concentrations of oligogalacturonides with a DP between 12 and 14 (Figure 40.2) induce flower formation but inhibit root formation. Oligogalacturonides also enhance cell expansion and thereby affect plant growth and development. Many of these effects may result from the ability of oligogalacturonides to alter the plant\\'s responses to the hormone auxin. Oligogalacturonide receptor proteins (WAKs) have been reported to bind to cell wall pectin and thereby affect plant cell expansion. Auxin-induced elongation of pea stem segments is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of a nonasaccharide-rich fragment of xyloglucan (Figure 40.2). Plants may also use endogenous Nod-factor-like signals to regulate their growth and development. Recent work on plants with altered lignin structure/composition suggests that plants have the ability to monitor changes in the structures of their walls and to trigger responses distinct from those involved in plant defense. In this case, the released active oligosaccharides appear to be fragments of rhamnogalacturonans, which are distinct from the oligogalacturonides involved in plant defense. These results suggest that plants are capable of using the substantial informational content of their wall glycans to release signals for diverse cellular pathways and responses.Chitin oligosaccharides may have a role in animal embryogenesis. The Xenopus gene DG42 encodes a protein with chitin synthase activity and is transiently expressed in endoderm cells during the mid-late gastrulation stage (Chapter 27). Homologs of DG42 have also been identified in zebrafish and mice. The DG42 protein has sequence homology with the Rhizobium NodC chitin synthase. Transgenic expression of DG42 results in the formation of glycans that are fragmented by chitinase. DG42 is also homologous to a gene encoding a hyaluronan synthase, and studies suggest that the DG42 protein synthesizes chitin and hyaluronan, with the former perhaps as an initiation primer (Chapter 16). Injection of chitinases or expression of NodZ (which encodes a fucosyltransferase that can modify chitin) in animal cells has profound effects on development. Thus, chitin oligosaccharides are examples of free glycans that appear to act as intracellular signaling molecules in animals.Human milk contains numerous compounds that affect newborn health including lactose, lipids, and the third most abundant component, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMOs are a set of more than 150 unique oligosaccharides synthesized from lactose in the mammary gland that are essentially not digested and function, among others, as prebiotics that selectively promote growth of mutualist intestinal microbes. HMOs contain lactose at their reducing end, may be fucosylated at O-2 of Gal (2′-fucosyllactose), at O-3 (3′-fucosyllactose), or may be sialylated at O-6 or O-3 of Gal. They may also be elongated by β1-3- or β1-6-linked lacto-N-biose or N-acetyllactosamine. HMOs can be linear or branched with α1-2, α1-3, or α1-4 fucosylation and/or α2-3 or α2-6 sialylation and may contain from three to more than 30 sugar units. The amount and composition of HMOs is genetically determined, varying among women and mirroring blood group characteristics. Increasing evidence suggests that HMOs protect breastfed infants from microbial infection through cell signaling and cell–cell recognition events resulting in enrichment of protective gut microbiota and inhibition of pathogenic microbe growth, adhesion, and invasion into the intestinal mucosa. For example, 2′-fucosyllactose, representing ∼30% of HMOs in human milk, has been shown to inhibit binding and infection of distinct enteropathogens (Chapter 42) by competing for binding of microbes to mucosal surface human receptors terminating in α1-2-linked fucose, thereby inhibiting the first step of pathogenesis. Although more research is required to understand the mechanisms of HMO action, current data indicate that HMOs stimulate immunomodulatory activity at the neonatal intestinal surface and modulate cytokine production.The presence of abnormal glycans or the accumulation of glycans in the wrong place may negatively impact signaling pathways in animal cells. Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an ER-associated negative regulator of innate immunity. Mutations that affect TREX1 function are associated with numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Chapter 45). The ER-localized carboxyl terminus of TREX1 has been proposed to interact with, and stabilize, the catalytic activity of the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and thereby suppress immune activation. The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies. Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders.N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter. It is not known if these free glycans have any signaling functions in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment. In the lysosome, glycosidases hydrolyze the glycans into monomeric sugars that can then be reused by the cell. Mutations that disrupt NGLY1 function may cause severe health problems in humans. Studies with Ngly1 mutant mice cells suggest that in the absence of NGLY1, ERAD becomes dysfunctional because a cytosolic endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase generates proteins that contain only a single Asn-linked GlcNAc instead of completely deglycosylated proteins. The accumulation of these GlcNAc-proteins may result in the formation of aggregates that are harmful to the cell or they may interfere with intracellular signaling processes.Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are signaling glycans because they interact with receptor tyrosine kinases and/or their ligands and facilitate changes in cell behavior (Chapters 16, 17, and 38). Hyaluronan oligosaccharides bind to specific membrane proteins, including CD44. In some cells, this binding leads to clustering of CD44, which activates kinases such as c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 with regulatory and adaptor molecules that modulate cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell survival and proliferation (Figure 16.6). Signaling by hyaluronan oligosaccharides depends on the DP of the glycans. Low molecular weight glycans are more active in triggering danger responses via binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs).In contrast to hyaluronan-dependent signal transduction, signaling via sulfated GAGs such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate occurs by an indirect mechanism. Indeed, few membrane receptors have been described in which sulfated GAGs binding causes a specific downstream response, such as phosphorylation of the receptor or activation of a kinase. Instead, sulfated GAGs bind to many ligand/receptor pairs, thereby lowering the effective concentration of ligand required to engage the receptor or increasing the duration of the response. An example of this is the ability of exogenous heparin or endogenous HS proteoglycans to activate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by FGF (Chapter 38). No substantial conformational change in the ligand occurs on binding to sulfated GAG, consistent with the idea that the glycan primarily aids in the juxtaposition of components of the signal transduction pathway. Free HS oligosaccharides can be released by the action of secreted heparanase. These glycans may facilitate signaling through the mechanism described above or by the release of growth factors from stored depots in the extracellular matrix. Sulfated GAGs also facilitate the formation of morphogen gradients in tissues during early development. Because the gradient determines cell specification during development, the glycan indirectly affects signaling responses in receptive cells. These examples do not exclude the possibility that sulfated glycosaminoglycans may act as ligands and induce signaling directly (e.g., by ligating receptors).In addition to mucins (Chapter 10), the innate immune system developed early in eukaryote evolution is a first line of defense against infection by microorganisms. A key feature of this system is its ability to distinguish self from infectious nonself. In more advanced eukaryotes, this is accomplished by receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns specific to the pathogens. Many of these PAMPs are glycans located on the surfaces of the microorganism. The glycans include the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycans and techoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria (Chapters 21 and 22) and the mannans and glucans of fungi, perceived by PRRs. Just as in plants (as described above), numerous PRRs are present in mammals that recognize diverse PAMPs and induce host-defense pathways, including TLRs and mannan-binding lectin (Chapter 42). Binding of PAMPs to TLRs activates various signaling pathways that induce inflammation and antimicrobial effector responses. Some TLRs are present on antigen-presenting cells and help to activate the adaptive immune response. TLRs also respond to tissue injury via binding of released hyaluronan fragments as DAMPs (Figure 16.6).One of the best-studied models of mammal innate immunity involves the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, which has a role in causing septic shock (see Chapter 42). Lipid A (endotoxin) is the glucosamine-based phospholipid anchor of LPS responsible for activating the innate immune system. Lipid A is an excellent PAMP as its structure is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. Picomolar concentrations of lipid A are detected by TLR-4. The LPS is first opsonized and complexed with another host cell-surface protein, CD14. The binding of LPS leads to recruitment of the adaptor proteins MyD88 and IRAK. This complex initiates a signaling cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately lead to the transcription of proinflammatory genes.In contrast to PAMPs and DAMPs, inhibitory Siglec receptors (Chapter 35) on mammal innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialylated glycoconjugates as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) and dampen unwanted immune reactions against the host. Details of the sialoglycan specificity involved require further investigation, but pathogens take advantage of the system via molecular mimicry (Chapters 7 and 42).Plants also exhibit a type of innate immunity that on activation could confer resistance to pathogen attack to the entire plant. Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides effectively protected grapevine and Arabidopsis against the fungal/oomycete pathogens, whereas β-1,3-glucans improved, among others, tobacco, and grapevine protection against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens. Given the high abundance of β-1,3-glucans in brown seaweed, laminarin-based products have been successfully developed for use in agriculture as activators of plant natural defense against pathogens. Similarly, pretreatments with cellobiose reduced growth of some pathogens on Arabidopsis seedlings, although high doses were required to observe such effects. In all of these cases, PRRs involved in the perception of these oligosaccharide structures that are active in generating these resistance responses in plants have not yet been characterized in detail.The examples given in this chapter indicate the diversity of free glycan structures that can function as signaling molecules. It is likely that further examples of glycan signals in both plant and animal cells, as well as in their interactions with microbes, will become apparent in the future.The authors appreciate the helpful comments, suggestions, and contributions from Xi Chen and Gabriel A.

Freeze, and Ajit Varki.Glycans mediate or modulate numerous physiologic functions. This brief chapter focuses on vertebrate physiology (predominantly human), providing physiologists and physicians an overview of glycan impacts on organ system functions. Pathological aspects of glycan biosynthesis and degradation are discussed elsewhere. Given the breadth of physiologic functions of glycans, the individual sections highlight just a few representative examples, and listings are necessarily incomplete.Glycans and glycan-binding proteins are important for both male and female reproduction. Studies in fish, frogs, and mammals indicate that glycans are involved in multiple steps in the process of fertilization (Chapter 27). In animals with internal fertilization, glycan-dependent recognition events occur during sperm interactions with reproductive tract mucins, in sperm–fallopian tube interactions, in sperm–ova binding within the fallopian tubes, and during implantation of the early embryo. Glycosylation-deficient male mice are sometimes infertile or subfertile. Following birth, mammals produce milk containing an array of glycoproteins and a complex mixture of species-specific milk oligosaccharides (Chapter 14).Genetic modifications that eliminate initial steps of major glycan synthetic pathways and of some monosaccharide biosynthetic pathways generally result in embryonic lethality, with one exception being deletion of individual genes needed for initiation of mucin O-GalNAc pathway, likely because of functional redundancy among the 20 different polypeptide:O-GalNAc transferases (Chapter 10). The causes of these lethal outcomes usually cannot be linked to specific glycoconjugates, but sometimes can be ascribed to a single mechanism such as the disruption of protein O-fucosylation, which impacts global Notch receptor signaling (Chapter 13). Conversely, loss of terminal glycan modifications are usually not embryonic-lethal, instead they have specific defects in some cell types. Elimination of glycosaminoglycans also causes developmental abnormalities, most likely because of their roles in modulating growth factor function and in setting up morphogen gradients (Chapter 17). Although the elimination of glycosaminoglycans causes systemic developmental abnormalities, elimination of some proteoglycan core proteins that carry these glycans can have tissue-specific consequences (Chapters 17, 25, and 26).Given the significant role of glycans in development, many classic biomarkers of mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs), defined initially by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), unsurprisingly turned out to be glycans. Many of these markers are species-specific. For example, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), otherwise known as Lewis x (Lex) or CD15, is a principal marker of mouse ESCs but is not present on human ESCs. Instead, human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells express globosides SSEA-3 and SSEA-4, and MAbs also react with TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81, which detect keratan sulfate–related antigens and, also, the tetrasaccharide motif Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc.Glycans affect functions of all classes of blood cells. ABO blood group antigens on human erythrocytes are glycans, and successful blood transfusion requires compatibility of these antigens between donor and recipient (Chapter 14). Glycans on glycoproteins (e.g., integrin GPIIb/IIIa [CD41/CD61]) on the surfaces of circulating platelets play key roles in hemostasis. The “platelet count” (i.e., number of platelets in blood) is tightly controlled; a low count (thrombocytopenia) causes bleeding and a high count (thrombocytosis) predisposes to pathologic clotting (thrombosis). Platelet count is affected by genetic alterations in enzymes responsible for synthesis of sialic acid (e.g., GNE) or of lactosamine units (e.g., B4GALT1) by increasing platelet destruction or inhibiting platelet production, respectively. Platelet aging is linked to loss of platelet surface sialic acid and increased clearance via the hepatic Ashwell–Morell receptor (AMR) (Chapter 34). Infection and inflammation can also cause thrombocytopenia because of human or microbial neuraminidases that render platelets available for AMR clearance. Selectins and their glycosylated ligands (Chapter 34) play critical roles in mediating the trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells into the marrow (a process critical for the success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and of extravasation of leukocytes from the bloodstream into tissues. In each case, the ability of the circulating cells to engage target tissue endothelial beds depends on their expression of the tetrasaccharide, known as sialylated Lewis x (Slex) or CD15s, the canonical minimal binding determinant for selectins, found on N- and O-glycans and glycolipids. Leukocyte deficiency of SLex expression results in decreased extravasation with concomitant increased risk of infections. Alternatively, enforced expression of SLex via glycoengineering of stem cell surfaces, or of subsets of leukocytes, can promote their delivery to inflammatory sites and thereby enhance tissue regeneration or immunologic functions, respectively. Further information regarding the impact of selectin receptor/ligand interactions in hematologic disease is presented in Chapter 46.Nearly all proteins in plasma are N-glycosylated for stability in circulation and their optimal function. Patients with N-glycosylation defects often have insufficient levels of coagulation factors such as antithrombin III and proteins C and S, because of instability and/or accelerated clearance (Chapter 45). The O-fucose glycans on Notch receptors regulate hematopoiesis and the hematopoietic stem cell niche (Chapter 13).In addition to SLex, other glycan moieties on N- and O-glycans of certain glycoproteins affect differentiation, adhesion, and survival of leukocytes (Chapters 36 and 45). Signaling in leukocytes is also regulated by Siglecs, which recognize sialic acid–containing ligands as “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs; Chapter 35), and O-fucose glycans on Notch receptors regulate many cell differentiation processes, including development of T cells in the thymus (Chapter 13). Galectins (Chapter 36) play key roles in immune cell activation and function, as do C-type lectins such as dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) on antigen-presenting cells (Chapter 34). Glycans are critical components of many antigens and may determine how epitopes are presented (e.g., presentation of glycolipid antigens by CD1a-positive lymphocytes and other antigen-presenting cells). Sialylated N-glycans in the IgG Fc domain play critical roles in antibody effector functions, and modulation of fucosylation and/or N-glycan display at Asn297 of human IgG regulates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation.Hyaluronan has a critical role in heart development (Chapter 16), and glycosaminoglycans modulate angiogenesis, in part because they bind growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (Chapter 17). The structural integrity of the walls of blood vessels is thought to depend on glycans, including a high density of sialic acids at the luminal surface of endothelial cells, as well as glycosaminoglycans within the basement membrane underlying endothelial cells. Cardiac muscle integrity and optimal cardiovascular function depend on various glycans.The luminal surface of epithelial cells in the upper and lower airways are covered by a dense and complex array of mostly O-glycosylated mucins (Chapter 10) secreted by goblet cells and submucosal glands. Structural glycoproteins, glycolipids, and secreted mucin molecules form barriers that maintain epithelial surface hydration and protect against physical and microbial invasion. Embryonic stem cells lacking complex N-glycans cannot properly organize the bronchial epithelium. N-glycans are also important for healthy lung function, as mice lacking the core α1-6-linked fucose of N-glycans develop emphysema-like symptoms caused by overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the lung tissue; this may result from aberrant transforming growth factor-β1 signaling through its misglycosylated receptor. Gene knockouts of individual mucin polypeptides show overlapping functions. Mice lacking O-fucose glycans in the lung do not generate secretory cells necessary for airway integrity.O-GlcNAc on proteins of the nucleus and cytoplasm modulate insulin action, and aberrant O-GlcNAcylation is linked to hyperglycemia (Chapter 19). N-glycans may also play a role in type II diabetes, as mice that cannot synthesize triantennary N-glycans develop diabetes when fed a high-fat diet. This deficiency alters the single N-glycan on the GLUT2 glucose transporter on pancreatic islet cells, accelerating its endocytosis, leading to loss from the cell surface and poor response to insulin. N-glycans may also be important for the production of functional thyroid hormones (e.g., targeting of endocytosed thyroglobulin to lysosomes for conversion to T3 and T4 in the thyroid gland; Chapter 33). The plasma half-life of several pituitary glycoprotein hormones is regulated by the presence of N-glycans that contain an unusual sulfated GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 31), which controls hormone clearance in the liver. O-GalNAc glycosylation can regulate peptide hormones by affecting proteolytic cleavage, as exemplified by O-glycan loss in the phosphate regulating hormone FGF23 causing familial tumoral calcinosis in patients deficient in GalNAc-T3 (Chapter 10).Glycosaminoglycans (Chapters 16 and 17) are required for normal development, organization, and structure of both the gums and teeth. Oral commensal organisms interact with each other or the host epithelium using glycan recognition. Salivary gland–generated mucins help protect the oral cavity by preventing bacterial biofilm formation on teeth (Chapters 10 and 42). However, mucin sialoglycans also provide binding sites for tooth cavity–facilitating bacteria.Glycans physically separate the luminal contents of the gut from the cells by organizing the mucin barrier that helps block pathogens. However, the microbiome of the GI tract also contains microbial symbionts that maintain a complex physiologic equilibrium. Some organisms practice “glycan foraging” of host (Chapter 37) and help prevent invasion by pathogens such as Helicobacter species in the stomach and anaerobic bacteria in the colon (Chapters 37 and 42). Helicobactor pylori infection rarely occurs in the duodenum, in which unusual GlcNAcα(1-4)-terminated O-linked mucins are expressed. This “antimicrobial glycan” inhibits the synthesis of cholesteryl-glucoside, a major cell wall component. Heparan sulfate in the intestinal basement membrane acts as a permeability barrier, preventing protein loss from the plasma into the gut. O-fucose glycans in the small intestine regulate the balance of secretory and goblet cells necessary for intestinal development.The liver synthesizes a large fraction of plasma proteins, and nearly all these proteins are heavily N-glycosylated, making hepatocytes a traditional cell type for studying the organization and function of the Golgi apparatus. Notably, acute phase reactants are glycoproteins, and variations in glycosylation patterns may reflect physiologic responses. Both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the liver have specific glycan-based recognition systems (e.g., the Ashwell–Morell receptor [AMR]) to clear unwanted circulating molecules (see Chapters 28, 31, 32, and 34 for more information on liver receptors). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the space of Disse between fenestrated endothelium and hepatocytes bind lipoproteins and aid in their clearance. Liver modification of bilirubin, hormones, and drugs with glucuronic acid (“glucuronidation”) increases the water solubility improving clearance in the bile and/or the urine (Chapter 5).Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (Chapter 17) and sialic acid residues (Chapter 15) on podocalyxin are needed for the filtering function of the glomerular basement membrane. In addition, reduced branching of complex N-glycans causes kidney pathology that may result from an autoimmune response. As in the pulmonary and gastrointestinal tracts, mucins with O-GalNAc glycans (Chapter 10) and proteoglycans with glycosaminoglycans provide a barrier function at the luminal surfaces of the ureters and bladder.Glucosylceramide and related glycosphingolipids help maintain the barrier function of the skin. Hyaluronan and dermatan sulfate each help maintain the structure of the dermis and participate in wound repair. The endothelial selectin “E-selectin” (CD62E) (Chapter 34) is induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or trauma on postcapillary venules. However, it is constitutively expressed on microvessels of skin, where it recruits SLex-bearing leukocytes and assures dermal immunosurveillance (Chapter 46).Proper adhesion of skeletal muscle to extracellular matrix laminin requires unique O-mannose glycans on the sarcolemmal glycoprotein α-dystroglycan (Chapter 27). Various defects in this pathway cause mild to severe muscular dystrophies in both humans and mice (Chapter 45). Glycan-related interactions can promote clustering of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Sialylated glycans on ion transport proteins are important, and their loss impairs control of calcium fluxes into skeletal muscle cells. Normal formation and ossification of cartilage into bone requires many glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronan and heparan, chondroitin, and keratan sulfates all in the appropriate amounts (Chapters 16 and 17).The central nervous system has the highest amount and concentration of sialic acid–containing glycolipids (gangliosides; Chapter 11), and alterations in these glycans affect neurological function. O-GlcNAcylation in specific cells of the brain sense nutrients and regulate satiety. The unusual polysialic acid chains on NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) differentially modulate the plasticity of the nervous system during embryogenesis (Chapter 15). The dystroglycanopathies mentioned above also typically have cognitive and/or neurologic defects in addition to muscle dysfunction (Chapter 45). There are additional instances wherein specific glycans appear to inhibit nerve regeneration after injury. Recognition of certain sialylated glycolipids by myelin-associated glycoprotein inhibits neuronal sprouting following injury (Chapter 35), and similar inhibitory effects may be mediated by the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate (Chapter 17). In both instances, targeted degradation of the glycan in vivo (by local injection of sialidase or chondroitinase, respectively) stimulates neuronal growth and repair, meaning that they normally prevent neuronal regeneration. Mutant mice lacking some complex N-glycans and glycosaminoglycans reveal the importance of these molecules in the development and organization of the nervous system (Chapters 9 and 17). Fucosylated N-glycans appear to play a role in modulating various aspects of neural development and function. The great majority of patients with inherited glycosylation disorders also have cognitive and/or neurological abnormalities, but specific mechanisms are mostly unknown (Chapter 45).The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Linda Baum and Victor Vacquier and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Ruth Siew and Hans Wandall.Only a few references are given here.

Schnaar, and Markus Aebi.This chapter illustrates and discusses some key mechanisms by which glycans influence the pathogenesis and progression of bacterial and viral infections and describes examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention.Infectious diseases remain a major cause of death, disability, and social and economic disorder for millions of people throughout the world. Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host.Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors.A human in good health is colonized by as many as 1013 bacteria on the skin and mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, a number that resembles the number of cells in our own body. Despite all these direct and continuous encounters, it is relatively rare that bacteria invade into the tissues to produce serious infections. Although not restricted to pathogenic species/strains, one feature shared by many of these disease-causing agents is the presence of diverse polysaccharide capsule structures, which encapsulate bacteria (Chapter 21). These structures can have many biological properties, both stimulating and thwarting immune detection in different settings. Capsules make key contributions to the virulence of multiple bacterial pathogens, reducing recognition by the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, capsular polysaccharides are also commonly the natural targets of the adaptive immune system. In fact, antibodies specific to different capsule structures often define the serology used to differentiate subtypes of particular bacterial species. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) encodes perhaps the most historically significant capsule in biology and medicine. Pioneering experiments by Frederick Griffith in 1928 showed the in vivo transfer of virulence from a dead encapsulated (smooth) disease-causing strain to an avirulent, nonencapsulated (rough) strain. Studies regarding immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharides (Figure 42.1) provided the framework for the discoveries of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, which showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information.Classical experiments on the role of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule in virulence. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) strains can be identified with either a “rough” (R) or a “smooth” (S) phenotype, the latter being (more...)Killing of bacteria by phagocytes of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils or macrophages, is aided by opsonization, a process in which the bacterial surface is tagged with complement proteins or specific antibodies. Phagocytes express receptors for activated complement and antibody Fc domains, allowing them to bind, engulf, and kill bacteria. Together these processes are referred to as opsonophagocytosis. Genetic mutagenesis of capsule biosynthesis genes and infectious challenge in small animal models have illustrated the roles of bacterial capsules in resisting opsonophagocytosis. Compared with the wild-type parent bacterial strains, isogenic capsule-deficient mutants of group A Streptococcus (GAS), group B Streptococcus (GBS), pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), and several other important human pathogens are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by opsonophagocytosis and fail to establish systemic infection. Some bacteria mimic the anionic host molecule sialic acid in their capsules, including the neonatal pathogens GBS and Escherichia coli K1. These sialylated capsules bind the complement regulatory protein factor H and attenuate complement deposition. Independent of the complement system, GBS sialic acids also reduce neutrophil bactericidal activities by directly engaging the sialic acid–binding receptor Siglec-9.Bacteria also use molecular mimicry to evade antibody generation by the adaptive immune system. Generally, humans can generate effective antibodies against bacterial polysaccharide capsules, but this ability is diminished early and late in life. Infants and the elderly are particularly prone to invasive infections with encapsulated pathogens. Molecular mimicry of common host glycan structures allows bacteria to masquerade as “self” to avoid being recognized by the adaptive immune system. For example, the GAS pathogen expresses a nonimmunogenic capsule of hyaluronan, identical to the nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan that is highly abundant in host skin and cartilage (Chapter 16). The contribution of capsule-based host mimicry to bacterial immune evasion is also illustrated by the homopolymeric sialic acid capsules of E. coli and meningococcus, an important cause of sepsis and meningitis. Whereas the group C meningococcal capsule is composed of an α2-9-linked sialic acid polymer that is a unique bacterial structure, the group B meningococcal capsule is composed of an α2-8-linked sialic acid polymer that is identical to a motif present on neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs) found in human neural tissues (Chapter 15). The group C capsule has proven to be a successful vaccine antigen in human populations, whereas the group B capsule is essentially nonimmunogenic. Bacterial polysaccharide capsules can also cloak immunogenic surface proteins to which antibodies might be directed.One of the challenges posed to the host is that different strains of the same bacterial species can display diverse compositions and linkages of repeating sugar units in their capsule structures. Often, these structures are immunologically distinct, allowing classification of different capsule “serotype” strains. For example, there are five major capsule serotypes of meningococcus (A, B, C, Y, and W-135), six different capsule serotypes of the respiratory pathogen H. influenzae (a–f), nine capsule serotypes of GBS (Ia, Ib, and II–VIII), and more than 90 different serotypes of pneumococcus, which is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Antibodies generated by the host against the capsule of one serotype strain typically do not provide cross-protective immunity. Thus, individuals can be repeatedly infected over their lifetime by different serotypes of the same bacterial pathogen. Figuratively, although the strategy of capsular molecular mimicry used for example by GAS renders the pathogen invisible to immune surveillance, the strategy of antigenic diversity of capsule types presents a moving target to the immune system. Genetic exchange of capsule biosynthetic genes among serotype strains of an individual species (e.g., the polysialyltransferase gene of meningococcus) can lead to capsule switching in vivo, which provides another means of pathogen escape from protective immunity.In addition to a polysaccharide capsule, Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that is rich in lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Chapter 21), also known as endotoxin. As its name suggests, LPS consists of two parts, a lipid A moiety and glycan components. Lipid A is comprised of two glucosamines, acyl chains and phosphates, which are embedded in the outer membrane. The glycan components extend outward into the bacterial niche. A core oligosaccharide contains some sugars not found in vertebrates (such as ketodeoxyoctulonate [Kdo] and heptose) and a repeating polysaccharide known as the O-antigen that can vary widely among strains within an individual species. Many mucosal pathogens such as H. influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae lack O-antigens; instead, they produce lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) that contain only lipid A and an extended core structure.LPS is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is recognized by the innate immune system and stimulates inflammatory processes, including the classic fever response. Bacteria that have breached the barrier defenses of the skin or mucosa release soluble LPS, which is recognized by membrane receptors CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), initiating downstream immune signaling processes (Figure 42.2). TLR4 belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of receptors (TLRs) that can detect a wide array of microbe-derived ligands. For example, the TLR2 receptor can recognize peptidoglycan or lipoteichoic acid derived from the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria that generally lack LPS. A signaling cascade ultimately leads to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus leads to the regulation of cellular processes ranging from immune cell differentiation, activation of the inflammasome, and up-regulation of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1).Activation of immune signaling by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is bound by the pattern-recognition molecule Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in conjunction with the cell-surface receptor CD14. The binding (more...)Although TLR-mediated detection of LPS and other microbial molecules is critical for triggering host innate immunity, a dangerous condition known as sepsis can develop in the setting of overwhelming bacterial infections that lead to dysregulated systemic immune responses. Symptoms include fever, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, abnormal white blood cell counts, and dysfunction of multiple organ systems that may lead to lung or kidney failure and death.Processes of selection have led to many examples of Gram-negative bacteria that vary or modify the structure of LPS to interfere with antibiotic action and host defenses. For example, some LPS modifications reduce the overall negative charge of LPS (e.g., as phosphoethanolamine or 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose [L-Ara4N]) and in doing so can repel cationic antimicrobial peptides of host and microbial origin, such as host defensins or bacterial polymyxins. The plague bacillus Yersinia pestis changes the number and type of acyl groups on the lipid A of its LPS in response to temperature changes. At environmental temperatures (∼21°C), Y. pestis, which lacks O-antigens, predominantly expresses a more immunostimulatory hexa-acylated lipid A, whereas at mammalian body temperature (37°C), the pathogen expresses a less immunostimulatory tetra-acylated lipid A. These data suggest that the production of a less immunostimulatory form of LPS on entry into a mammalian host might confer avoidance to immune detection.Sialic acids and related nonulosonic acids are also synthesized de novo or scavenged from the host for incorporation into the LOS of several Gram-negative pathogens, including pathogenic members of the genera Haemophilus, Neisseria, Campylobacter, and Vibrio. This can be accomplished by several distinct mechanisms and often confers properties of immune evasive and enhanced virulence. For example, the human-specific pathogen N. gonorrhoeae uses a surface sialyltransferase and scavenges the activated form of sialic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) from the host. Such incorporation thwarts multiple arms of the host complement system and confers resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPS). An Achilles’ heel of this increasingly drug-resistant pathogen may be the promiscuity of its sialyltransferase toward related nonulosonic acids. Unnatural incorporation of legionaminic acid (CMP-Leg5,7Ac2) in N. gonorrhoeae prevents the immune evasion benefits typically afforded by Neu5Ac; moreover, vaginal administration of CMP-Leg5,7Ac2 leads to more rapid bacterial clearance of genital infections in mice.Studies of another Gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, underscore that the presence of legionaminic acid in LOS may not always be a deterrence to virulence. V. vulnificus is normally present in environmental (aquatic) ecosystems and is pathogenic in humans only during accidental contact with susceptible individuals, often following consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. Although it is a rare human pathogen, the bacterium can cause bloodstream and disseminated infections that are commonly fatal when they strike. Legionaminic acid contributes to the ability of V. vulnificus to survive in bloodstream and cause disseminated infection following intravenous administration.Occasionally, the host mounts an (auto)immune response to “self” antigens, including sialylated LOS. For example, the foodborne pathogen, C. jejuni, is capable of expressing a variety of sialylated LOS structures that mimic human gangliosides (Chapters 11 and 46). Sialylation of C. jejuni LOS results in CD14-dependent amplification of mucosal dendritic cell (DC) responses, which promote B-cell proliferation in a T-cell-independent manner. These events may help explain why in a small subset of infections, self-reacting (autoimmune) antibodies are inappropriately produced by B cells, leading to the attack of nerve fibers expressing the relevant gangliosides. These events can result in a life-threatening paralytic disorder known as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). For most patients, GBS symptoms have to be managed by removing cross-reactive antibodies (plasmapheresis) or immunomodulatory therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).Adherence to skin or mucosal surfaces is a fundamental characteristic of the normal human microbiome and also an essential first step in the pathogenesis of many important infectious diseases (Chapter 34). Most microorganisms express more than one type of adherence factor or “adhesin” (Chapter 37). A large fraction of microbial adhesins are lectins that bind directly to cell-surface glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, or glycosaminoglycans. Adhesion may be mediated through terminal sugars or internal carbohydrate motifs. In other cases, the bacteria express adhesins that bind matrix glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, or laminin) or mucin, mediating attachment to the mucosal surface. The specific carbohydrate ligands for bacterial attachment on the animal cell are often referred to as adhesin receptors, and they are quite diverse in nature. The tropism of individual bacteria for particular host tissues (e.g., skin vs. respiratory tract vs. gastrointestinal tract) is determined by specific combinations of adhesin–receptor pairs.Pili or fimbriae are assemblies of protein subunits that project from the bacterial surface in hair-like threads whose tips often adhere to host glycans (Figure 42.3A). Such pili are usually composed of a repeating structural subunit providing extension and a different “tip adhesin” responsible for binding. The structural proteins for pilus assembly are often encoded in a bacterial operon. Lateral mobility of pili structures in the bacterial membrane provides a Velcro-like binding effect to epithelial surfaces. Certain strains of E. coli express pili that bind avidly to P-blood group–related glycosphingolipids in the bladder epithelium, leading to urinary tract infection. Pathogenic strains of Salmonella produce pili that facilitate adherence to human intestinal cell mucosa, thereby causing food poisoning and infectious diarrhea. In other cases, a surface-anchored protein (afimbrial adhesin) expressed by the bacteria represents a critical colonization factor (Figure 42.3B). For example, the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis promotes strong attachment of the bacteria to the ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchi and trachea, triggering local inflammation and tissue injury that results in the “whooping cough” disease. FHA is a component of modern pertussis vaccines given in infancy and early childhood to block infection.Examples of mechanisms of bacterial adherence to host cell surfaces. (A) Pili or fimbriae are organelles that project from the cell surface. They are made up of a repeating structural subunit and a protein at their tip that mediates recognition of a specific (more...)Adhesins can be glycoproteins as well. In Pasteurellaceae and some H. influenzae strains adhesins are N-glucosylated by a cytoplasmic N-glucosylation system that is homologous to the cytoplasmic O-GlcNAc transferase of eukaryotes. Similarly, transfer of heptose residues by the dodecameric bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family of enzymes to autotransporter adhesins in several different Gram-negative pathogens is essential for the adhesion process.Glycan–lectin interactions play pivotal roles in enabling certain pathogens to penetrate or invade through epithelial barriers, whereupon they may disseminate into and through the bloodstream to produce deep-seated infections. Samonella Typhi causes typhoid fever in humans, a process that begins with intracellular invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The outer core oligosaccharide structure of the LPS is required for internalization into epithelial cells. Removal of a key terminal sugar residue on the outer core markedly reduces the efficiency of bacterial uptake. Once invasion has occurred, the secreted A2B5 typhoid toxin mediates illness by first binding preferentially to the sialic acid Neu5Ac, which is enriched in humans. Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), the cause of strep throat, as well as serious invasive infections, attaches to human pharyngeal and skin epithelial cells via interaction of its hyaluronan capsular polysaccharide with the host hyaluronan-binding protein CD44 (Chapter 16). This binding induces marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane ruffling and opening of intercellular junctions that allow tissue penetration by GAS through a paracellular route.Bacterial glycosyltransferases are also involved in the intracellular manipulation of host responses. For example, injection of the NleB glycosyltransferase into host cells by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) results in the N-GlcNAc modification of arginine residues of host proteins, leading to the suppression of NF-κB-driven responses. Another bacterial glycosyltransferase with an intracellular target is the GlcNAc transferase toxin of Photorhabdus asymbiotica PaTox. PaTox modifies the host Rho GTPase at tyrosine residues, resulting in reduced phagocytosis and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton in insect and mammalian cells.Biofilms are assemblies of bacteria affixed to environmental or host surfaces. Within the body, biofilms form on catheters, implanted devices, and other medical products in which their metabolic dormancy together with other physical, biochemical, and biological properties help resist the action of host defenses and antimicrobials. Layers of biofilm are often joined together by extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) that contribute architectural, adhesive, and protective functions. The EPS synthesized by bacteria in biofilms varies greatly in composition and in chemical and physical properties. Likewise, EPSs can have wide-ranging functions within biofilms, which depend on their exact compositions and the many facets of the niches in which they reside. Polysaccharides can also contribute to biofilm persistence by scavenging reactive oxygen species, trapping cationic antimicrobial peptides and antibiotics, and protecting against desiccation.In the human mouth, polymicrobial biofilms contribute to dental plaque, caries, and periodontal (gum) disease. Dental plaque is a polymicrobial biofilm comprised of hundreds of species in which dense, mushroom-like clumps of bacteria pop up from the surface of the tooth enamel. Biofilm bacteria are interspersed with bacteria-free diffusion channels filled with nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and EPS (Figure 42.4). Streptococcus species are often the initial colonizers of the tooth enamel and comprise 60%–90% of dental plaque. In periodontal (gum) disease, “early-” and “late-colonizers” of the biofilm are bridged by an impressive variety of lectin-glycan interactions involving the “middle colonizer” Fusobacterium nucleatum. This bacterium is found ubiquitously in the human mouth, but overgrows in the setting of periodontitis, binding to members of the outermost layers of the mature biofilm.Structure of a polymicrobial biofilm. Dental plaque is an example of a polymicrobial biofilm in which Streptococcus species and other bacteria secrete a thick exopolysaccharide matrix and exist within this matrix in a dormant or sessile state of low metabolic (more...)Many EPS types are polyanionic because of the presence of either uronic acids (D-glucuronic, D-galacturonic, or D-mannuronic acids) or ketal-linked pyruvate. Inorganic residues, such as phosphate or sulfate, also contribute to the negative charge and modifications such as O-acetylation or sugar epimerization further contribute to EPS complexity.In several cases, EPS is a homoglycan composed of β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues known as poly-N-acetylglucosamine (or PNAG), as exemplified by the adhesive polymer obtained from Staphylococcus epidermidis strains that produce biofilms on catheters. PNAG is common among many oral pathogens and multidrug-resistant bacteria resulting in concerted efforts to target this polymer, especially because antibodies raised against the deacetylated form of PNAG mediate opsonic killing. Interestingly, the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans secretes a PNAG hydrolase known as dispersin B (DspB) that has been shown to effectively disperse biofilms formed by PNAG-producing bacteria and is therefore also being developed as an adjuvant to antibiotic therapy.Viruses bind to host cells as a prerequisite for entry and intracellular replication. The enrichment of glycans on cell surfaces make them an attractive target for viral attachment and entry. Virus–glycan interactions are often responsible for species and tissue tropism (Table 37.1), as illustrated here with examples of three human pathogens: influenza virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), showing different modes of glycan-mediated viral interactions (Figure 42.5). Influenza viruses use a sialic acid–recognizing protein (hemagglutinin) for binding and entry (Figure 42.5A). HSV-1 has multiple envelope proteins that bind to heparan sulfate (HS) as the first step in recruitment of a multiprotein virus entry complex (Figure 42.5B). HIV expresses surface glycans that co-opt host lectins to enhance cell dissemination, but has also evolved to use specific protein receptors (Figure 42.5C). In contrast to these three examples, coronaviruses seem to be undergoing more rapid evolution, with regard to preferred ligands. Many of these viruses have a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) that binds to specific O-acetylated sialic acids and they possess an esterase that cleaves the O-acetyl group. Some coronaviruses have eliminated the HE protein entirely and switched to sialic acid-binding via a spike protein. A few appear to have evolved further to preferentially bind to very specific host glycoproteins such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, for the SARS viruses). SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic) has also been shown to bind HS, an interaction that appears necessary for infecting ACE2-positive cells through stabilizing the up conformation of the spike receptor binding domain. Numerous reviews have been pulished on the glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (including the spike glycoprotein shown on the cover image), the host glycoproteins involved in viral interaction, and the relevance of glycosylation in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and immune avoidance, numerous reviews have been published.Mechanisms of viral entry into host cells. (A) Influenza virus initiates host cell contact and entry by binding to cell-surface sialic acid receptors through its surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin. After intracellular replication, a cell-surface neuraminidase (more...)Influenza viruses are common human pathogens of the upper respiratory tract. Seasonal epidemics result in hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, with occasional, much more deadly pandemics. Influenza gains entry into cells of the human upper airway by binding to glycans terminated with α2-6-linked sialic acid (preferentially the human enriched one, N-acetylneuraminic acid or Neu5Ac) (Chapter 15). The entry process is mediated by influenza hemagglutinin, named for the method of its discovery. When first isolated in the 1930s, influenza was found to cause clumping (agglutination) of human red blood cells in vitro. Upon continued incubation, the red cells disaggregated and were not reagglutinated by fresh virus. It was hypothesized that a “receptor-destroying enzyme” was responsible. Isolation of the virus-released receptor revealed sialic acid that had been released by a sialidase, a term that is synonymous with neuraminidase. The familiar numbering system H1N1 represents hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).The life cycle of influenza starts with binding of the viral hemagglutinin to cell-surface sialic acids followed by hemagglutinin-mediated fusion with the host cell membrane, release of the virions intracellularly, replication, and then budding of newly assembled virions from the host cell surface. The hemagglutinin directs species and tissue tropism, whereas the neuraminidase is essential for propagation of the infection to neighboring cells. On completing its cellular replication cycle, the release of influenza viruses from infected cell surfaces relies on viral neuraminidase, which removes sialic acid from the surface of the host cells and the virion envelope. Without neuraminidase, newly formed virions stick together, form large rafts, and do not spread to other cells. Two rationally designed influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor-based anti-influenza drugs, Relenza and Tamiflu, operate on this basis (Chapters 55 and 57).Emergence of new human influenza strains occurs via transmission from other animal species, especially poultry. Sialic acid linkages in these different systems is key to understanding species tropism. Glycan array screening revealed that avian influenza binds to glycans terminated with α2-3 linked Neu5Ac, whereas human isolates bind to glycans terminated with α2-6 Neu5Ac. Neu5Ac in the α2-3 linkage is common in the intestinal tracts of birds but not found at substantial levels in the human upper airway. In contrast, α2-6-linked Neu5Ac predominates in the human upper airway. The switch from α2-3 to α2-6 binding is thought to underlie the emergence of new human influenza strains. This switch can occur by mutation of one or two amino acids in the hemagglutinin sialic acid–binding pocket. The emergence of animal influenza strains that bind α2-6 sialic acids is now monitored to detect potential new human influenza pathogens. Pigs are susceptible to both α2-3 (avian) and α2-6 (human) viruses, and can act as a “mixing vessel” to produce recombinant viruses capable of transmission from birds to humans. Direct avian–human transmission is often associated with enhanced morbidity, but human-to-human spread of avian influenza is uncommon. Notably, ferrets are the most effective animal model for human influenza studies as they have similar upper airway glycans terminated with α2-6 Neu5Ac.Several nonenveloped viruses also have sialic acid–binding proteins on their icosahedral capsids including reovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, and rotavirus, each of which binds to different sets of sialoglycans.Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which are widely distributed on vertebrate cells (Chapter 17), are implicated in the infective process of many pathogenic viruses including adeno-associated viruses, dengue viruses, hepatitis C virus, vaccinia virus, HIV, papillomavirus, and virtually all herpesviruses. In many cases, HS is a coreceptor, initiating attachment before recruitment of other host receptor proteins that support viral entry. A prominent example is HSV-1, also known as human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), one of the eight currently known human herpesviruses that cause widespread disease.HSV-1 establishes latent, recurrent infections of mucous membranes, particularly lesions of the mouth and lips (cold sores, fever blisters) but also of genital tract and cornea, the latter of which may cause blindness. Unlike most other viruses, in which host cell binding and entry are mediated by one or two viral proteins, herpesvirus entry requires several viral entry glycoproteins, some of which are shared among all herpesvirus family members. One shared viral glycoprotein, gB, initiates virus attachment by binding to cell-surface HS, as does gC in HSV-1. Once bound, the virus “surfs” the cell surface until it encounters other receptors, including a specific HS structure, 3-O-sulfation on GlcNAc. This relatively rare HS modification induces binding of gD, another glycoprotein shared in the herpesvirus family. Once gD binds, it recruits additional proteins required for fusion and host cell entry.Removal of HS from cell surfaces enzymatically or by selection of mutant cells defective in HS expression renders the cells resistant to HSV-1 infection by reducing virus attachment. Soluble heparin and HS mimetics inhibit viral infection by masking the HS-binding domain on the virus envelope. Immobilized HS columns bind to the HSV-1 viral entry proteins gB and gC, and HSV-1 deletion mutants lacking gB and gC exhibit impaired virus binding. Genetic evidence of a role of 3-O-sulfation of HS GlcNAc in HSV-1 infection was obtained by altering the expression of 3-O-sulfotransferase genes in cells and living organisms. Recent evidence suggests that up-regulation of the host\\'s own heparanase helps newly budded HSV-1 to disseminate to neighboring cells, analogous to the role of influenza neuraminidase. Although the herpesviruses have evolved much more complex systems for host cell binding and entry, some of which remain to be established, it is clear that HS plays important roles in viral pathogenesis.HIV is a retrovirus and the etiologic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a pandemic disease affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. HIV is an enveloped virus with a surface dominated by spikes made of two proteins, gp120 and gp41, of which gp120 mediates viral attachment to host cells, primarily CD4+ T cells, by binding to the host cell-surface receptor CD4 and a chemokine receptor coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4. HIV gp120 is heavily glycosylated, with N-linked glycans comprising half of the spike mass and densely covering much of the spike surface. Dense glycosylation is thought to aid in immune evasion by masking the underlying polypeptide. However, gp120 glycans also actively support infection by co-opting host lectins, including C-type lectins on DCs (Chapter 34).DCs are innate immune cells that capture and present antigens to T cells to initiate adaptive immunity. DCs capture antigens, in part, using C-type lectins that bind to glycan determinants common to pathogens but uncommon on host cells. Although DCs are not numerous, they are important in recognizing and presenting pathogen antigens to the adaptive immune system. DCs that reside in submucosal tissues of the vagina and rectum are early targets for HIV. Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes.The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum.Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host\\'s diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet.Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world\\'s population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage. H. pylori also expresses Lewis x–containing structures in the O-antigen of its LPS, which resemble Lewis x–modified glycans on the surface of parietal cells in the gastric lining. This Lewis antigen mimicry can be varied through the expression of two variable α1,3 fucosyltransferases, FutA and FutB. Similar to B. thetaiotaomicron, H. pylori has also developed mechanisms to obtain fucose from its host. The presence of H. pylori stimulates the host to secrete α-L-fucosidase 2 (FUCA2). This, in turn, increases the expression of the Lewis x–containing LPS O-antigen in H. pylori. Variation in both organism and host in the expression of Lewis x glycan structures and/or the adhesins may help explain the wide range of potential clinical outcomes following colonization by H. pylori.This chapter provides only a glimpse of the diverse roles glycans play in the interactions between individual viruses and bacteria with their hosts. As scientists explore varying environments and their associated microbial communities (which also include parasites, fungi, and bacteriophages), it is becoming increasingly apparent that glycans influence every aspect of these interactions and there remains so much more to discover.The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Victor Nizet and Jeffrey D.

Haslam.Parasitic protozoans and helminths (worms) synthesize glycans with structures often different from those typically found in vertebrates, and are thus often antigenic. Parasites also express glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) involved in host invasion and parasitism. As part of the disease process, parasite glycans can trigger the host\\'s innate immune system, which can lead to the induction of adaptive immune responses. This chapter discusses the major roles of glycoconjugates in parasitic infections.Parasitism is a condition in which one organism (the parasite) in some way lives at the expense of the host. Parasites infect millions of people worldwide and cause much suffering and death, especially in underdeveloped countries (Table 43.1). Like other types of infections (e.g., bacterial or viral) (Chapter 42), parasite GBPs interact with host glycomes and parasite glycans interact with host GBPs and antibodies. Thus, research on parasite glycobiology and biochemistry could provide therapeutics for reducing disease morbidity and mortality. Moreover, studies on the molecular pathology of organisms, such as parasites that have evolved to deceive and compromise the host immune system, provide novel insights into the regulation of human innate and adaptive immune responses.Worldwide distributions of some major parasitic human diseases The majority of parasitic diseases are divided into two categories: those caused by protists (single-celled organisms; Table 43.2) and those caused by helminths (worms/metazoans; Table 43.3). The major classes of protozoan parasites include Plasmodium (causing malaria), Entamoeba histolytica (causing amebiasis), Leishmania (causing leishmaniasis), and Trypanosoma (causing sleeping sickness and Chagas disease). Parasitic worms include trematodes (e.g., Schistosoma mansoni, causing schistosomiasis), nematodes (e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides) and cestodes or tapeworms (e.g., Taenia solium, causing taeniiasis). Worms are very large relative to host cells. Thus, most worms live in the extracellular spaces of their hosts, and have evolved a variety of infective and protective strategies. Glycoconjugates are important in both the life cycles and pathology of most major parasites. For example, many parasitic protozoans and helminths have elaborated intriguing mechanisms to target GBPs (Chapter 29) or glycans in the host to promote parasitism, and to evade host immune responses.Some of the major parasitic protozoans of humans Some of the major parasitic helminths of mammals Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, prominently Plasmodium falciparum in humans. Malarial parasites lead a complicated life cycle, alternating between a sexual reproduction stage in the female Anopheles mosquito vector and an asexual reproduction stage in mammalian tissues (hepatocytes and erythrocytes) and the bloodstream (Figure 43.1). Cell–cell interactions between the parasite and host are critical for the successful completion of each stage.Life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, a parasitic protozoan that causes the most severe form of malaria in humans. The bite of the female Anopheles mosquito introduces sporozoites into the human host, which mature as they travel to the liver and ultimately (more...)Following inoculation into the bloodstream, the sporozoite\\'s major circumsporozoite protein (CSP) interacts with heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of hepatocytes, which allows invasion and the first replication in the mammalian host. Liver HS possesses an unusually high degree of sulfation compared to similar glycosaminoglycans from other organs, suggesting the basis for the selective targeting of Plasmodium to hepatocytes. A recombinant form of the pre-erythrocytic CSP made in yeast is a components of the RTS,S vaccine currently being implemented worldwide. Interestingly, the T-cell epitope of CSP is O-fucosylated, but the recombinant yeast-derived protein is not O-fucosylated.On exit from the liver, Plasmodium merozoites use multiple ligand–receptor interactions to invade host erythrocytes. The merozoite proteins, such as the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) proteins (Table 43.4), vary in their dependency on sialic acid residues on the erythrocyte surface and play an important role in erythrocyte invasion.Some major parasites and their glycan-binding proteins The glycophorins are the major sialic acid–containing glycoproteins on erythrocytes. The EBL protein EBA-175 (erythrocyte-binding antigen-175) recognizes clusters of sialylated O-glycans attached to glycophorin A, particularly within a 30-amino-acid region that carries 11 O-glycans. Desialylation of erythrocytes precludes interactions of some strains of P. falciparum, and individuals lacking glycophorins A or B are refractory to invasion. Some strains of P. falciparum can reversibly switch from sialic acid–dependent to sialic acid–independent invasion, and this has important implications for vaccine design against malaria parasites.Pregnancy-associated malaria is a major cause of suffering and arises when P. falciparum–infected erythrocytes are sequestered in the placenta of pregnant women. The parasite expresses the VAR2CSA protein, which mediates adherence of the infected erythrocytes to placental chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) with very high specificity and affinity (Kd∼15 nm), promoting parasite infection and invasion.Eruption of the merozoites from infected erythrocytes releases free glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), which are prominent virulence factors contributing to malaria pathogenesis (Chapter 12). P. falciparum GPIs mimic host GPIs and activate host GPI-associated signaling pathways. The GPIs can activate host\\'s macrophages, mainly through Toll-like receptor-2 signaling, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of cell-adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin in endothelial cells. Antibodies to these GPIs can neutralize their effects and mitigate the pathology of the disease independently of direct infection.In addition, the P. falciparum genome encodes a number of enzymes involved in N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation (O-fucosylation) and C-mannosylation. Whereas N-glycans are truncated and typically contain only a chitobiosyl core, GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ-Asn, mannose is abundantly present in GPI anchors. There is also evidence suggesting that Plasmodia may express a number of unusual glycoconjugates, such as galactose- and glucose-containing glycoproteins and glucose-containing glycolipids.African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) transmitted by blood-sucking tsetse flies are the etiologic agents of nagana disease in cattle and sleeping sickness in humans. A remarkable feature of these organisms is their ability to survive extracellularly in the host bloodstream, where they are constantly exposed to the immune system. Evasion of the host immune response depends on “antigenic variation,” a highly evolved survival strategy that relies on structural variance of GPI-anchored glycoproteins (VSGs) on the trypanosome surface (Figure 43.2). VSGs are dimeric proteins, consisting of two 55-kDa monomers that each carry N-linked oligomannose-type glycans, which make up a large component of the dense glycocalyx. As parasites multiply in the host bloodstream, the host mounts an immune response that is effective against only the population of trypanosomes expressing a particular VSG. Trypanosomes that have switched to an alternative VSG coat (encoded among 1000 distinct VSG genes) escape immunological destruction.Schematic representation of the major surface glycoconjugates of procyclic and metacyclic Trypanosoma brucei. VSG (variant surface glycoprotein) is the major component of the metacyclic form, and each molecule consists of two GPI-anchored N-glycosylated (more...)Within the gut of the tsetse fly, the trypanosome replaces its entire VSG coat with acidic glycoproteins called procyclins (Figure 43.2). These GPI-anchored proteins form a dense glycocalyx and are composed of polyanionic polypeptide repeat domains projecting from the membrane. Unusual features are the presence of a single type of N-glycan (Man5GlcNAc2) and GPI anchors that are modified with branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine [Galβ1-4GlcNAc]n glycans. The terminal β-galactose can be substituted with α2-3-linked sialic acid by a parasitic trans-sialidase that transfers sialic acid from host glycoconjugates to the parasite surface. This sialylation protects the parasite in the insect intestine and can compromise the human immune system. Among parasites, genes encoding trans-sialidases have only been found in the protozoan genus Trypanosoma and occur in both T. brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. Interestingly, there is also evidence for trans-sialidase activities in some bacteria and in human serum, but these are far less well studied.T. cruzi, transmitted by reduviid bugs, is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, or South American trypanosomiasis. T. cruzi has a dense coat of glycosylinositolphospholipids (GIPLs) (Chapter 12) and mucins (Chapter 10) that project above the GIPL layer (Figure 43.3). The GIPLs contain the same basic structure as other GPI anchors, except that they are heavily substituted with Gal, GlcNAc, and host-derived sialic acid. The mucins contain large amounts of O-glycans composed of a serine- or threonine-linked αGlcNAc extended with one to five Gal residues (including Galf) that can be substituted with sialic acid by a trans-sialidase. For T. cruzi sialylation is believed to reduce the susceptibility of the parasite to anti-α-Gal antibodies that are normally present in the mammalian bloodstream.Schematic representation of the major surface glycoconjugates of Trypanosoma cruzi. The cell surface of T. cruzi is covered with a dense layer of mucins, with extensive O-glycosylation, glycosylinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), and lipopeptidophosphoglycan (more...)T. cruzi also express lipopeptidophosphoglycan (LPPG), the major surface glycan of the insect stage of the parasite (Figure 43.3). Depending on the life-cycle stage, LPPG is composed of an inositolphosphoceramide-anchored glycan or an alkylacylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycan that includes nonacetylated glucosamine, mannose, galactofuranose, and 2-aminoethylphosphonate (2-AEP). The lack of ceramide anchors and galactofuranose in mammalian cells suggests potential targets for the development of chemotherapeutic agents.Leishmania causes different forms of leishmaniasis, which manifest clinically in three forms: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral, the latter being fatal if untreated. Leishmania parasites have a remarkable capacity to avoid destruction in the hostile environments they encounter during their life cycle, alternating between intracellular macrophage parasitism and extracellular life in the gut of their sandfly vector (Figure 43.4).Life cycle of Leishmania species, the parasitic protozoan that causes leishmaniasis in humans. Stage-specific adhesion is mediated by structural variation of the abundant cell-surface glycoconjugate lipophosphoglycan (LPG), which contributes to parasite survival in the hydrolytic midgut (Figure 43.5). The basic LPG structure in all Leishmania species consists of a 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-phosphatidyl(myo)inositol lipid anchor, a heptasaccharide core, a long phosphoglycan (PG) polymer composed of (-6Galβ1-4Manα 1-PO4-) repeat units, and a small oligosaccharide cap. In many species, the PG repeats contain additional substitutions that mediate key roles in stage-specific adhesion. For example, in Leishmania major, the PG repeats bear β1-3-galactosyl side-chain modifications, which provide a binding site for the sandfly midgut galectin, PpGalec. As parasites differentiate in the sandfly from amastigotes into procyclic promastigotes, and finally to infective metacyclic stages, the β1-3 Gal-modified PGs are capped by α1-2 arabinosyl residues, giving rise to a structure that does not bind to PpGalec and thus facilitating detachment of the parasite from the sandfly midgut. LPG is highly abundant on the parasite surface, suggesting a central role for the glycoconjugate in the parasite\\'s infectious cycle, as well as allowing the parasite to establish successful infections in the mammalian host. In addition, galectin-3 in the vertebrate host may recognize some of the L. major glycans as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, facilitating leukocyte responses to infection.Schematic representation of the major cell-surface glycoconjugates of Leishmania. Lipophosphoglycan (LPG) consists of a Gal-Man-PO4- repeat unit backbone attached to a lipid anchor via a glycan core. Secreted glycoproteins and mucin-like molecules called (more...)Leishmania express also an abundance of other important glycoconjugates, such as GIPLs, GPI-anchored proteins, and secreted proteophosphoglycans (PPGs) (Figure 43.5) (also see Chapter 12). Most of the serine residues within PPGs are phosphoglycosylated with Gal-Man-PO4- repeats via unique phosphodiester linkages. In Leishmania mexicana, these highly anionic polysaccharides form a gel-like matrix composed of interlocking filaments. These matrices enhance parasite development in the sandfly and contribute to the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole in macrophages of the mammalian host, where the parasite replicates.Virtually every known glycoconjugate of Leishmania shows some intersection with the LPG biosynthetic pathway. The presence of molecules bearing similar modifications raises the possibility that they share biosynthetic steps. The early steps in LPG and GPI biosynthesis (up to Man-Man-GlcN-PI) occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, and galactosylation of the LPG glycan core and assembly of the PG repeats occurs in the Golgi apparatus (Chapter 12). The phosphoglycan portions of LPG and PPG are assembled by the sequential and alternating addition of mannose-PO4- and galactose, forming the characteristic -Galβ1-4Manα1-PO4- repeats. Depending on the species of Leishmania, additional branching sugars can then be added, creating a remarkable array of side chains that drive Leishmania–sandfly vectorial competence.Leishmania spp. are also able to generate sialylated glycans, both α2→3 and α2→6 linkages with the latter being most prevalent. In addition, the parasite can generate O-acetylated versions of sialic acid. Interestingly, like for Trypanosoma, Leishmania does not synthesize sialic acid de novo, but instead acquires it from the host. Although Leishmania has several sialic acid transporters, it is not yet clear how the sialylated glycans are acquired and produced by Leishmania. The sialylated glycans they present may interact with multiple Siglecs, especially macrophage Siglecs, that contribute to infection and cell signaling.The life cycle of E. histolytica, causing amebic dysentery and hepatic abscesses, includes the disease-inducing amebic or trophozoite stage, and the infectious cyst stage. Mature cysts are ingested by an animal, and once inside the host gut, excystation produces the trophozoite that causes pathology. The trophozoites can replicate or form cysts, which are passed via feces to complete the cycle. E. histolytica expresses several lectins, among them a Gal/GalNAc lectin, a GPI-anchored heterodimeric glycoprotein. This lectin mediates binding of the parasite to colonic mucins and plays a critical role in parasite viability, and is a promising vaccine candidate against the disease. The Entamoeba cyst wall is composed mostly of chitin, and chitin-binding lectins (including the Jacob and Jessie lectins) accompanied by remodeling via chitinases, help to create the cyst wall.Entamoeba trophozoites synthesize cell-surface LPG and LPPG (Figure 43.6). The LPG consists of a lipid anchor and a phosphoglycan component that resembles the phosphoglycans of Leishmania LPG. The LPPG GPI anchors are unique in that they have a glycan backbone that contains the sequence Gal1Man2GlcN-(myo)inositol, in which α-Gal replaces the terminal α1-2 mannose residue found in typical protein anchors. Leishmania LPG and LPPG are important as virulence factors, because antibodies raised against these molecules inhibit the ability of the parasites to kill target cells. Thus, such glycans may be the target for vaccine development.Structure of Entamoeba histolytica lipopeptidophosphoglycan (LPPG). Schistosomiasis, a major parasitic disease associated with a high morbidity worldwide is caused by parasitic trematodes. Three major species infect humans: Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma haematobium (Figure 43.7). Schistosoma is unique among helminths in that the male and female worms pair to live together in the blood vessels of their host. The female lays eggs ∼4–6 weeks after infection, which adhere to the endothelium and migrate through vessels into tissues. The eggs may become lodged in the host tissues, where they sequester and induce granulomatous inflammatory responses. Eggs trapped in the peripheral circulation can cause portal hypertension and fibrosis, which are characteristic of chronic schistosomiasis and lead to morbidity and often death. However, many eggs eventually pass through the gut or bladder wall into the stool or urine and continue the cycle through intermediate snail hosts, which are unique for each Schistosoma species. Thus, the geographical limitation to the spread of this disease is the range of the intermediate host snails.Life cycle of Schistosoma species, the parasitic helminth that causes schistosomiasis in humans. (Left) Alternating cycle between the invertebrate snail host and the human definitive host; (right) passage of the worms and their maturation to adult sexually (more...)Schistosomes, especially the cercarial glycocalyx and eggs, generate huge quantities of membrane-bound glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids. Many glycoproteins derived from the tegument, gut, and eggs of the parasite are highly antigenic and occur in the circulation of the infected mammalian host. These proteins are generally rich in complex glycan structures, and contain an impressive array of O- and N-glycans. Fucosylated antigens are a common feature of most schistosome glycoconjugates, including Lewisx (Lex), LacdiNAc (LDN), and fucosylated LacdiNAc (LDNF) structures, and polyfucose branches (Figure 43.8). Like all helminths, glycoconjugates from schistosomes lack sialic acids, but in schistosomes and several other worms, glucuronic acid is present as a negatively charged monosaccharide.Examples of structures of glycans found in parasitic helminths, including Schistosoma mansoni and Haemonchus contortus. The antigens are indicated by the structures within the brackets. (LDN) LacdiNAc; (Lex) Lewis x; (CAA) circulating anodic antigen; (more...)The glycoconjugate structures expressed among schistosome species show some variation, but much less than between schistosomes and other helminths. For example, schistosomes have extended difucosylated oligosaccharides, but these structures are absent in other helminths. The LeX antigen, which is abundant in schistosomes also occurs in Dictyocaulus viviparus, a parasitic nematode in cattle, but overall is found in very few helminths. In addition to schistosomes, Echinococcus granulosus, Dirofilaria immitis, and Haemonchus contortus synthesize glycoproteins containing LDN and LDNF, in addition to other fucosylated and xylosylated glycans (Figure 43.8). The expression of many of these glycan structures is developmentally regulated and stage-specific, but their fundamental roles in parasite development and host pathogenesis are mostly unclear. In addition to the roles of schistosome glycans in the interaction with the mammalian host, essential interactions between schistosomes and the intermediate snail host are glycan-dependent.There is mounting evidence that the glycan antigens expressed by schistosomes can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Individuals infected with Schistosoma species develop a wide variety of antibodies to glycan antigens, which may provide partial protection against subsequent infections. A general feature of helminth infections, including chronic schistosome infections, is that T-helper 2 (Th2) immune responses (promoting humoral immunity) predominate over Th1 responses (promoting cellular immunity). Such Th2-driven responses also contribute to the generation of alternatively activated macrophages with wound-healing and anti-inflammatory properties. The induction of an anti-inflammatory immune response facilitates survival of the parasites in their hosts, but also benefits the host by reducing unrelated inflammatory responses (e.g., in autoimmune diseases). Worm-derived molecules from schistosomes and other helminths, including glycoconjugates, play a role in such modulation of the host immune response. Helminths, and their secreted products, are currently being evaluated as novel therapy for chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn\\'s disease and multiple sclerosis.Schistosome glycans are recognized by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages via GBPs, in particular C-type lectins (Chapter 34), including pattern-recognition receptors as dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and the mannose receptor. For immune responses to many helminths, collectins and surfactant protein D help to limit the pathology of infection. Internalization and processing of parasite glycoconjugates by dendritic cells can lead to polarization of adaptive immune responses and cellular activation (Chapter 34). The identification of many antigenic glycoconjugate structures from schistosomes is helping in the design of new diagnostic approaches for schistosomiasis. Because antibody responses to schistosomes are mainly directed against antigenic glycan motifs, and antibodies to such glycans can kill and inhibit parasite growth and egg deposition, such glycans may be targets of vaccine development. The characterization of schistosome glycosyltransferases responsible for antigenic glycan biosynthesis, together with enzymes from the intermediate snail hosts, may also help in the identification of new drug targets and the development of glycan-based vaccines and therapeutics.Glycoconjugates and GBPs, as discussed above, play an impressive role in host infection by many different parasites. Several additional examples are shown in Table 43.4. Many protozoan parasites appear to use GBPs as a major mechanism for host-cell attachment and invasion. For example, Acanthamoeba keratitis, which causes severe eye infections involving the corneal epithelium, adheres to host cells via a lectin-glycan interaction and precludes amoeba-induced cytolysis of target cells. Adhesion is mediated by a mannose-binding protein, which is strongly inhibited by Manα1-3Man disaccharides. Furthermore, mannose and mannose-6-PO4- can inhibit adhesion of Giardia lamblia trophozoites, and these glycans may be recognized by the parasite\\'s antigenic protein taglin. Other antigenic proteins, including several galectins, have been cloned from parasitic nematodes including Teladorsagia circumcincta. Sporozoites from Cryptosporidium parvum, an opportunistic protozoan that infects individuals with compromised immunity, have hemagglutinating activity, and a lectin on the parasite surface may play a crucial role in host-cell attachment. Recently, a sialic acid–binding protein in Toxoplasma gondii has been identified (SABP1) that is important for infection by this protozoan.In addition, the glycan antigens of many parasites are being characterized in an effort to develop vaccines and new diagnostics for the diseases they cause. For example, synthetic glycoconjugates based on glycan structural components of P. falciparum GPI to create a malaria vaccine and the T. cruzi cell surface mucins that are being utilized to develop serological assays to improve Chagas disease diagnostics, and the detection by lateral flow assay of secretory glycan antigens of Schistosoma in urine or blood allows sensitive diagnosis of active infections in the field.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Salvatore Turco and Irma van Die.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Schnaar.This chapter explores degradation and turnover of glycans in lysosomes, especially with respect to human genetic disorders, with representative glycans, illustrating features unique to different pathways. Degradation of oligomannosyl N-glycans removed from misfolded, newly synthesized glycoproteins is covered in Chapters 39 and 45.Most glycans are degraded in lysosomes by highly ordered pathways using endo- and exoglycosidases, sometimes aided by noncatalytic proteins. Insights that unraveled these complex pathways emerged from studies of rare human genetic disorders called lysosomal storage diseases. In each disease, undigested molecules accumulate in lysosomes. Clever experiments combining enzymology with glycan structural analyses revealed the steps of the pathways and also unlocked the mechanisms of lysosomal enzyme targeting (Chapter 33).Lysosomes contain approximately 50 to 60 soluble hydrolases that degrade various macromolecules. Most of the glycan-degrading enzymes (endo- and exoglycosidases and sulfatases) have pH optima between 4 and 5.5, but a few have higher pH optima, nearing neutral. Exoglycosidases cleave the glycosidic linkage of terminal sugars from the nonreducing end of glycans (the outermost left end of glycans for figures in this book, e.g., Figure 44.1). Exoglycosidases recognize only one monosaccharide (rarely two) in a specific anomeric linkage and are much less particular about the structure of the molecule beyond that glycosidic linkage. This lack of specificity allows these enzymes to act on a broad range of substrates. However, exoglycosidases do not usually work unless all of the hydroxyl groups of the terminal sugar are unmodified. Acetate, sulfate, or phosphate groups usually have to be removed before action of the glycosidases. Esterases cleave acetyl groups and specific sulfatases remove the sulfate groups on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N- or O-linked glycans. Endoglycosidases cleave internal glycosidic linkages of larger chains. These enzymes are often more tolerant of modifications of the glycan; in some cases, they require a modified sugar for optimal cleavage.Degradation of complex-type N-glycans. The lysosomal degradation pathway of glycoproteins carrying complex-type glycans proceeds simultaneously on both the protein and glycan moieties. The N-glycans are sequentially degraded by the indicated exoglycosidases (more...)Even though the lysosomal glycosidases perform similar reactions, their amino acid sequences are only ∼15%–20% identical to each other. Thus, there are no highly conserved glycosidase catalytic domains. Lysosomal enzymes are all N-glycosylated, and most are targeted to the lysosome by the mannose 6-phosphate pathway (Chapter 33), share aspects of the recognition marker for assembly of mannose 6-phosphate on N-linked glycans, and have affinity for mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The concentration of enzymes within the lysosome is difficult to determine. Proteinases such as cathepsins are estimated to be ∼1 mm; glycosidases are probably present at much lower concentrations.About 50 known inherited diseases impair lysosomal degradation of macromolecules. Although each one is rare, together their occurrence is about one in every 5000 to 10,000 births. Loss of a single lysosomal hydrolase leads to the accumulation of its substrate as undegraded fragments in tissues and the appearance of related fragments in urine. Many of the human disorders have animal models. Tables 44.1, 44.2, and 44.3 show some of the major clinical symptoms of diseases associated with the degradation of three classes of glycans. Many of the diseases share overlapping symptoms, and yet each disease has unique clinical features that allow it to be diagnosed. Many of the diseases also present with a range of severities. Usually, an infantile onset is the most severe, and the juvenile or adult onsets have milder symptoms. The later-onset forms may even affect organ systems distinct from those affected by early-onset forms. Hundreds of mutations have been mapped in the different disorders. The severity usually depends on the combination of mutated alleles. Predicting the disease severity (prognosis) from the specific mutation is generally difficult. Complete absence of a lysosomal hydrolase is uniformly severe. Hypomorphic alleles have variable residual glycosidase activity making their prognosis difficult. If there is a defect on mannose 6-phosphate–mediated targeting of lysosomal hydrolases, it will also lead to a lysosomal storage disease such as I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) or pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis III) (Chapter 33).Defects in glycoprotein degradation—the glycoproteinoses Defects in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation—the mucopolysaccharidoses Defects in glycolipid degradation It is not clear whether accumulating different types of undegraded glycans leads to the different symptoms characteristic of each disease. There is no evidence that the stored material causes lysosomes to burst and spew their contents into the cytoplasm. However, increased lysosomal exocytosis or fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane has been noted for some disorders. Many lysosomal disorders have defects in autophagy. This can result in impaired clearance of damaged organelles like mitochondria. The pathology likely depends on the cell type and the cellular balance of synthesis and turnover rates. For instance, dermatan sulfate (DS), a GAG (Chapter 17), predominates in connective tissue, which might explain the bone, joint, and skin problems in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I, II, VI, and VII. Keratan sulfate (KS), another GAG, is present in cartilage; therefore, MPS IV is largely a skeletal disease. Gangliosides (Chapter 11) are most abundant in neurons; therefore, gangliosidoses are predominantly brain disorders. The importance of glycogen for muscle explains the impact of Pompe disease, a lysosomal disease caused by a mutation of GAA gene encoding α-glucosidase important for glycogen degradation, on the heart and diaphragm, leading to rapid lethality in that disease. Secondary storage of glycans is a common finding in many of these disorders, highlighted by the accumulation of glycolipids in the cholesterol storage disease, Niemann–Pick type C and in several disorders with GAG storage. Given the balance between synthesis and degradation of multiple glycans, reducing synthesis somewhat by the use of an inhibitor may help to retard the accumulation of primary or secondary storage and reduce the pathology of some diseases.The great majority of N- and O-glycans reaching the lysosome contain only six sugars linked in one or two anomeric configurations: β-N-acetylglucosamine (βGlcNAc), α/β-N-acetylgalactosamine (α/βGalNAc), α/β-galactose (α/βGal), α/β-mannose (α/βMan), α-fucose (αFuc), and α-sialic acid (αSia). Each linkage should theoretically require only one anomer-specific glycosidase, assuming that each glycosidase ignores the underlying glycan. This number is close to the known number of enzymes in most glycan degradation pathways. However, some linkages require a specific enzyme outside of this group. For example, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase cleaves both βGlcNAc and βGalNAc residues. Degradation of the GlcNAcβAsn and GalNAcαSer/Thr linkages also requires specific enzymes.Much of what we know about this pathway comes from analysis of products that accumulate in patients’ tissues or urine because of the absence of one of the degradative enzymes (Table 44.1). Structural analyses of monosaccharide-labeled glycoproteins during degradation in perfused rat liver aided elucidation of the pathway. By conducting the latter studies in the presence of inhibitors of different lysosomal enzymes, a picture of simultaneous and independent bidirectional degradation of the protein and carbohydrate chains emerged (Figure 44.1). The relative degradation rates vary depending on structural and steric factors of the protein and the sugar chains. The accumulation of GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβAsn in cells that cannot cleave the GlcNAcβAsn linkage clearly shows that degradation of the sugar chain does not require advanced cleavage of the Asn. Much of the protein is probably degraded before N-glycan catabolism begins. Removal of core fucose (Fucα1-6GlcNAc) and probably any peripheral fucose residues linked to the outer branches of the chain (e.g., Fucα1-3GlcNAc) appears to be the first step in degradation, because patients lacking α-fucosidase still have intact N-glycans bound to asparagine. Glycosylasparaginase (aspartyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase) then cleaves the GlcNAcβAsn bond, producing a glycosylamine +Asp, not Asn. In rodents and primates, chitobiase (an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) removes the reducing N-acetylglucosamine, leaving the oligosaccharide with only one terminal GlcNAc. In many other species, splitting of the chitobiose linkage (GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc) uses the β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, mentioned below, as the last step in degradation. Either pathway appears to be effective, leaving the presence of chitobiase in some species unexplained. The oligosaccharide chain is then sequentially degraded by sialidases and/or α-galactosidase, followed by β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and α-mannosidases. The remaining Manβ1-4GlcNAc (or Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc in species lacking chitobiase) is cleaved by β-mannosidase to mannose and GlcNAc (or chitobiose, which is then cleaved to GlcNAc by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase).Lysosomal sialidase (neuraminidase), β-galactosidase, and a serine carboxypeptidase called protective protein/cathepsin A form a complex in the lysosome that is required for efficient degradation of sialylated glycoconjugates. Cathepsin A protects β-galactosidase from rapid degradation and also activates the sialidase precursor, but the protection does not depend on the catalytic activity of cathepsin A. Mutations in this protective protein lead to galactosialidosis in which the simultaneous deficiencies in β-galactosidase and sialidase are secondary effects of defective cathepsin A.Glycans that have GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc, GlcAβ1-3Gal, or Galα1-3Gal on the outer branches must first have these residues removed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, β-glucuronidase, and α-galactosidase, respectively, before any further digestion of the underlying oligosaccharide chains.Oligomannosyl N-glycans that enter the lysosome are hydrolyzed by an α-mannosidase to yield Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAc, a common intermediate of hybrid and complex-type N-glycan. A second α1-6-specific mannosidase can cleave this linkage in humans and rats, but only on molecules that have a single core region N-acetylglucosamine (i.e., those generated by chitobiase cleavage). Finally, β-mannosidase completes the degradation. Oligomannosyl N-glycans derived from dolichol-linked precursors or misfolded glycoproteins are handled differently (Chapter 39).Degradation of typical αGalNAc-initiated O-glycans has not been systematically studied. Many of the outer structures of N-glycans are also found on O-glycans (Chapter 14); therefore, degradation of these glycans probably uses the same group of exoglycosidases as discussed above. An exception to this is the linkage region, GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr. Patients with Schindler disease lack the α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase specific for αGalNAc and will not cleave αGlcNAc. This same enzyme probably removes terminal αGalNAc from blood group A–containing glycans (GalNAcα1-3Gal) and some glycolipids such as the Forssmann antigen (GalNAcα1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcβCer). Patients lacking α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase accumulate GalNAc-containing glycopeptides in their urine, but curiously they also accumulate more complex, extended glycopeptides containing N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid. The structures are the same as those found on some native glycoconjugates. Their production could result from a general slowdown of oligosaccharide degradation or may arise by reassembly of glycans on accumulated GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr glycopeptides.GAGs, including heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), DS, KS, and hyaluronan, are degraded in a highly ordered fashion. The first three are O-xylose-linked to core proteins (Chapter 17), KS is N- or O-linked, and hyaluronan is a free glycan (Chapter 16). Some proteoglycans are internalized from the cell surface and the protein portion is degraded. The GAG chains are then partially cleaved by enzymes such as endo-β-glucuronidases or endohexosaminidases that clip at a few specific sites. Endoglycosidase cleavage creates multiple terminal residues that can be degraded by unique or overlapping sets of sulfatases and exoglycosidases. Structural analyses of partially degraded fragments in the lysosomes of cells from patients with MPS revealed both the degradation pathways and genetic defects responsible (Table 44.2). The clinical severities and manifestations vary even with mutations in the same gene. For instance, MPS I is clinically subdivided into Hurler (most severe), Hurler–Scheie, and Scheie syndromes, although the three disorders represent a continuum of the same disease (Table 44.2). Hurler–Scheie patients progress more slowly and die in early adulthood, whereas Scheie patients can survive to middle or old age. The milder forms of this disease do not cause intellectual disability.Hyaluronan (Chapter 16) is the largest and most abundant GAG: A 70-kg person degrades 5 g of hyaluronan (molecular mass 107 Da) per day. Degradation of hyaluronan involves a series of two endo-β-N-acetylhexosaminidases called hyaluronidases (Hyal-1 and Hyal-2), β-glucuronidase, and finally β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. Hyal-2 is active at low pH and is GPI-anchored on the cell surface (Chapter 12). This enzyme associates both with hyaluronan in lipid rafts and with an Na+/H+ exchanger to create an acidic microenvironment. Cleavage generates fragments of ∼20 kDa (approximately 50 disaccharides), which are internalized, delivered to endosomes, and then finally to lysosomes, in which the fragments are degraded by Hyal-1 into tetra- and disaccharides (Figure 44.2). The exoglycosidases are thought to participate in the degradation of the larger fragments as well as that of the di-and tetrasaccharide units. Mutations in HYAL-1 cause MPS IX.Degradation of hyaluronan and heparan sulfate (HS). (Left) Hyaluronidase (an endoglycosidase) cleaves large chains into smaller fragments, each of which is then sequentially degraded from the nonreducing end. (Right) Degradation of HS. An endo-β-glucuronidase (more...)HS (Chapter 17) is first degraded by an endoglucuronidase, heparanase, followed by a well-ordered sequential degradation. An example is shown in Figure 44.2. A terminal iduronic acid-2-sulfate must be desulfated by iduronic acid-2-sulfatase to make the modified sugar a substrate for α-iduronidase. If glucuronic acid (GlcA)-2-sulfate is at this position, GlcA-2-sulfatase removes the sulfate before β-glucuronidase cleavage. The new terminal glucosamine sulfate (GlcNSO4) is the next sugar for cleavage, requiring three steps. Sulfate is first removed by N-sulfatase forming glucosamine, which cannot be cleaved by α-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The free amino group is N-acetylated by an N-acetyltransferase embedded in the lysosomal membrane, converting glucosamine to N-acetylglucosamine, which is a substrate of α-N-acetylglucosaminidase. In the second step, acetyl CoA donates the acetyl group to a histidine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the N-acetyltransferase. The acetyl group then becomes available on the luminal side of the lysosomal membrane and is transferred at low pH to the amino group of glucosamine. If cleavage of glucuronic acid reveals a 6-O-sulfated αGlcNAc, the sulfate is removed by a specific GlcNAc-6-sulfatase before GlcNAc removal. Table 44.2 provides a list of the enzymatic defects in HS degradation and the disorders that result.DS and CS are related GAG chains based on a repeating polymer of βGlcA and βGalNAc (Chapter 17). Figure 44.3 shows that a combination of endoglycosidases, sulfatases, and exoglycosidases degrades DS in the lysosome. Iduronic acid-2-sulfatase is followed by α-iduronidase. The terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 can be removed by either of two pathways. In the first pathway, a GalNAc-4-SO4 sulfatase acts followed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A or B to remove N-acetylgalactosamine. In the second, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A removes the entire GalNAc-4-SO4 unit followed by sulfatase cleavage. β-Glucuronidase cleaves the β-glucuronic acid residue and the process is repeated on the rest of the molecule.Degradation of chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (CS/DS) and keratan sulfate (KS). (Left) Only DS degradation is shown. After removal of sulfated iduronic acid in two steps, further sequential degradation can proceed by two different routes. One route (straight (more...)To degrade CS, GalNAc-6-SO4 sulfatase and GalNAc-4-SO4 sulfatase work in combination with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A or B and β-glucuronidase. Hyaluronidases can also degrade CS, but no CS-specific endoglycosidases have been found.KS is an N- or O-glycan with a heavily sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain. Mammalian cells do not have an endoglycosidase to break down KS (Figure 44.3). The sequential action of sulfatases and exoglycosidases is needed. Galactose-6-SO4 sulfatase is the same enzyme that desulfates GalNAc-6-SO4 in CS degradation. This hydrolysis is followed by β-galactosidase digestion, leaving a terminal GlcNAc-6-SO4. Desulfation by the sulfatase followed by cleavage with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A or B eliminates GlcNAc-6-SO4. Alternatively, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A can directly release GlcNAc-6-SO4, followed by desulfation of the monosaccharide.Degradation of the core region of O-linked KS (skeletal type; type II) probably occurs by the same route as other O-glycans. The N-glycan corneal-type KS (type I) is probably degraded by the same set of enzymes used for N-glycan degradation. The O-xylose-linked GAG chains (DS, CS, and HS) all share a common core tetrasaccharide: GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ-O-Ser. An endo-β-xylosidase has been detected in rabbit liver. How the linkage regions are degraded is not established.A very rare human disorder is multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD). All sulfatases are casualties of this defect because they all undergo a posttranslational conversion of an active site cysteine residue to a Cα-formylglycine (2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid) catalyzed by the Cα-formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is essential for activity. In essence, the SH group of cysteine is replaced by a double-bonded oxygen atom that probably acts as an acceptor for cleaved sulfate groups. Loss-of-function mutations in the FGE gene lead to inactive sulfatases. This deficit affects GAG degradation and any other sulfated glycan such as sulfatides.Glycosphingolipids (Chapter 11) are degraded from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases while they are still bound to the lipid moiety ceramide. Because glycosphingolipids share some of the same outer sugar sequences found in N- and O-glycans (Chapter 14), many of the same glycosidases are used for their degradation (Figure 44.4). However, specific hydrolases cleave the glucose–ceramide and galactose–ceramide bonds. Besides specific enzymes, noncatalytic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) help to present the lipid substrates to enzymes for cleavage. Ceramide glycanase (endoglycoceramidases) from leeches and earthworms release the entire glycan chain from the lipid, much like PNGase releases N-glycans from proteins.Degradation of glycosphingolipids. Required activator proteins are shown in parentheses and individual enzymes are as shown in previous figures in this chapter. (SAP) Saposin. Some exoglycosidases are unique to glycolipid degradation, and their absence causes glycolipid storage diseases (Table 44.3). Glucocerebrosidase, also called β-glucoceramidase, is specific for the degradation of the GlcβCer bond. The loss of this enzyme causes Gaucher\\'s disease. Heterozygous mutations in this enzyme have been shown to be among the most prevalent and robust genetic risk factors for Parkinson\\'s disease, highlighting a role for glycolipid degradation in the context of more common neurological disorders. A specialized β-galactosidase, β-galactoceramidase, hydrolyzes the bond between galactose and ceramide and can also cleave the terminal galactose from lactosylceramide. Loss of this enzyme produces Krabbe disease. Galactosylceramide is often found with a 3-sulfate ester (sulfatide) and a specific sulfatase (arylsulfatase A) is needed for its removal before β-galactosylceramidase action. Loss of this sulfatase causes metachromatic leukodystrophy and the accumulation of sulfatide. Glycolipids terminated with α-galactose residues (globo-series; Chapter 11) are degraded by a specific α-galactosidase, the loss of which causes Fabry disease.Sugars that lie too close to the lipid bilayer apparently give limited access to soluble lysosomal enzymes, and additional proteins called saposins are required to present the substrates to the enzymes. Saposins (SAPs), also called “liftases,” form complexes with multiple degradative enzymes for more efficient hydrolysis of short glycolipids close to the membrane. SAPs are derived from a 524-amino-acid precursor called prosaposin, which is processed into four homologous activator proteins each comprising ∼80 amino acids: saposins A, B, C, and D. Despite their homology, each saposin has different properties. SAP-A and SAP-C help β-galactosyl- and β-glucosylceramidase degradation, respectively. SAP-B assists arylsulfatase A, α-galactosidase, sialidase, and β-galactosidase. The activation mechanism of SAPs is thought to be similar to that of the GM2 activator described below. SAP-D and SAP-B also assist in sphingomyelin degradation by sphingomyelinase. Complete absence of prosaposin is lethal in humans, and deficiencies in SAP-B and SAP-C lead to defects that clinically resemble arylsulfatase A deficiency (metachromatic leukodystrophy) and Gaucher\\'s disease. These symptoms might be predicted based on the enzymes that these saposins assist.GM2 activator protein forms a complex with either GM2 or GA2 and presents them to β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A for cleavage of β-GalNAc. The activator protein binds a molecule of glycolipid, forming a soluble complex, which can be cleaved by the hexosaminidase. The resulting product is then inserted back into the membrane, and the activator presents the next GM2 molecule, and so on. Genetic loss of this activator protein causes the accumulation of GM2 and GA2, resulting in the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis.Endocytic vesicles deliver membrane components to the lysosome for degradation and are often seen as intralysosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs). They appear like vesicles within the lysosome and are especially prominent in patients with glycolipid storage disorders. How do “vesicles within vesicles” form and what is their function? The internal surface of the lysosomal membrane has a thick, degradation-resistant glycocalyx of integral and peripheral membrane proteins decorated with poly-N-acetyllactosamines, which protect the lysosomal membrane against destruction. However, these proteins would also shield incoming membranes from degradation if vesicle fusion simply occurred. By creating multiple internal membranes seen in typical MVBs, the target molecules are exposed to the soluble lysosomal enzymes, and digestion proceeds efficiently on the membrane surfaces of these internal vesicles.MVB formation starts with inward budding of the limiting endosomal membrane. Lipids and proteins are sorted to either the internal or the limiting membrane. Ubiquitination of cargo proteins targets them to internal vesicles of MVBs, but ubiquitin-independent routes also exist. Intra-endosomal membranes and limiting endosomal membrane have different lipid and protein compositions. Membrane segregation and lipid sorting prepare the internal membranes for lysosomal degradation. During maturation of the internal membranes, cholesterol is continually stripped away (to <1%) and a negatively charged lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) increases up to 45%. This molecule is highly resistant to phospholipases. BMP also stimulates sphingolipid degradation on the inner membranes of acidic compartments. Because BMP is not present in the lysosomal outer membrane, the unique lipid profile ensures that degradation by hydrolases and membrane-disrupting SAPs occurs without digesting the lysosomal outer membrane.Degradation of glycans is not always complete. Partially degraded or incomplete glycans on glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycosphingolipids can be internalized within a functional Golgi compartment containing sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases and then elongated. In the case of glycosphingolipids, this pathway makes a substantial contribution to total cellular synthesis, but in glycoproteins it probably makes a relatively small contribution. These processes can be salvage and repair mechanisms or may play an integral part in an unidentified physiological pathway.The half-life of certain membrane proteins is longer than the half-life of their sugar chains. Terminal monosaccharides turn over faster than those near the reducing end of the glycan, suggesting that terminal sugars are removed by exoglycosidases. Cleavage may occur at the cell surface or when proteins are endocytosed in the course of normal membrane recycling. Because the mildly acidic late endosomes contain lysosomal enzymes with a fairly broad pH range, terminal sugars such as sialic acid can be cleaved. If the endocytosed proteins are not degraded in lysosomes, the proteins may reencounter sialyltransferases in the Golgi, become resialylated, and appear again on the cell surface. A similar situation may occur if a protein has lost both sialic acid and galactose residues from its glycans. Some membrane proteins synthesized in the presence of oligosaccharide processing inhibitors can still reach the cell surface in an unprocessed form. Subsequent incubation in the absence of inhibitors leads to normal processing over time. The extent of processing and the kinetics depend on the protein and the cell type. Because Golgi enzymes are not distributed identically in all cells, the extent of reprocessing is variable. Most studies have monitored N-glycans, but membrane proteins with O-glycans probably behave similarly.The majority of the newly synthesized glucosylceramide arrives at the cell surface by a Golgi-independent cytoplasmic pathway. Some of this material, as well as glucosylceramide generated by partial degradation of complex glycosphingolipids, can recycle to the Golgi. There, like glycoproteins, simple glycosphingolipids can serve as acceptors for the synthesis of longer sugar chains. In the lysosome, sphingosine is produced by complete degradation of glycosphingolipids and reused. Together, these pathways, especially the latter, may account for the majority of complex glycolipid synthesis in many cells. Depending on the physiological state of the cell and synthetic demands, the de novo pathway starting from serine and palmitoyl CoA may account for only 20%–30% of the total synthesis. Shuttling the recycled components through and among the various organelles appears to involve vimentin intermediate filaments. Mechanisms and details of this process are presently lacking.Monosaccharide salvage is discussed in Chapter 5. Monosaccharides derived from glycan degradation are transported back into the cytoplasm using transporters specific for neutral sugars, N-acetylated hexoses, anionic sugars, sialic acid, and glucuronic acid. Turnover of glycans is high and the salvage of sugars can be quite substantial. There have been few studies comparing the actual contributions of exogenous monosaccharides, those salvaged from glycan turnover, and those generated from de novo synthesis. Cells probably differ in their preference for each source of monosaccharides. These differences may explain why monosaccharide therapy used to treat some glycosylation disorders is effective in certain cells and not others.Lysosomal degradation of glycans can be blocked by raising the intralysosomal pH, by inactivating a particular glycosidase, by mutation, or by protein-specific inhibitors.Lysosomal enzymes usually have acidic pH optima, and adding ammonium chloride or chloroquine slows degradation by increasing the intralysosomal pH. However, some lysosomal enzymes have relatively broad pH optima, higher than the lysosome. Some active “lysosomal” enzymes can be found in early and late endosomes, which have a higher pH than lysosomes.Glycosylation inhibitors are covered in Chapter 55 but some of these agents also inhibit specific lysosomal enzymes. For example, swainsonine blocks lysosomal α-mannosidase as well as the α-mannosidase II involved in glycoprotein processing. Sheep and cattle become neurologically deranged by eating food rich in swainsonine, which is also called locoweed. These temporary symptoms are likely induced because lysosomal α-mannosidase is inhibited. Undegraded oligosaccharides probably accumulate in affected animals. Although many inhibitors block various enzymes in vitro, they may not be effective in cells or whole animals because they may not enter the lysosome at sufficient concentrations.Study of lysosomal enzyme defects provided major insights into catabolic pathways and showed their importance to human health. Mannose 6-phosphate targeting of lysosomal enzymes was discovered by showing that cocultivation of fibroblasts from patients with different storage diseases led to the disappearance of stored material in both types of cells. Each supplied the corrective factors (i.e., lysosomal enzymes) that the other cell lacked by delivery of secreted enzymes through cell-surface mannose 6-phosphate receptors (Chapter 33). Cross-correction provides the mechanistic basis for an important mode of therapy and highlights the fact that only a relatively small amount of enzyme may be needed to prevent accumulation of storage products and the resulting pathology. Some estimates suggest that <5% of normal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity may be sufficient to prevent pathological symptoms of Tay–Sachs disease. In fact, the index Scheie patient with α-L-iduronidase deficiency had <1% normal activity in fibroblasts and lived 77 years.Current therapeutic approaches include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), enzyme enhancement therapy (EET), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Gene replacement therapy is a promising future approach because it would avoid the sustained delivery necessary for ERT. Accumulation of stored undegraded material occurs because the rate of glycan synthesis is greater than its degradation at steady state. SRT reduces the glycan\\'s synthetic rate to counter low glycosidase activity. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease by using N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. When wild-type mice were treated with this compound, the amount of glycosphingolipids fell 50%–70% in all tissues without obvious pathological effects. When this compound was given to Sandhoff disease mice, the accumulation of GM2 in the brain was blocked and the amount of stored ganglioside reduced. Thus, reducing the synthesis of the primary precursor reduced the load of GM2 to levels that were degradable by the glycosidase-deficient mice. Because this compound inhibits the first biosynthetic step, theoretically this drug could reduce the accumulation of storage products in any glycolipid storage disorder.In clinical trials, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustat, Zavesca) was effective for many patients with mild-to-moderate Gaucher\\'s disease, although improvement varied, as did side effects. Small trials in infantile Tay–Sachs disease patients did not arrest neurological deterioration but prevented macrocephaly. Further clinical studies are likely to reveal the potential and limitations of SRT.EET or pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT) is based on the concept that inhibitors of an enzyme can act as molecular chaperones to stabilize the mutated enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When the enzyme reaches the lysosome, the inhibitor dissociates at low pH and the abundant stored material is gradually digested. The overall increase in activity is small, but it can have significant clinical benefits. Clinical trials are in progress for treating Fabry disease, Gaucher type I, and Pompe disease, whereas preclinical trials are being performed for GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis. A potential problem is that some inhibitors may not cross the blood–brain barrier, limiting their effectiveness in the central nervous system (CNS). The advent of high-throughput screening methods and large chemical libraries increase the potential of this approach. In addition, allosteric site binders can be selected that remain bound to the enzyme, and any successful compound could be used in combination with ERT to further enhance activity.ERT has been quite successful for treating Gaucher\\'s disease. Injection of glucocerebrosidase carrying mannose-terminated N-glycans targets the enzyme to the macrophage/monocytes, which are the primary sites of substrate accumulation. In use now for many years, the added enzyme consistently improves patients’ clinical features with minimal side effects. The cost of treatment is high, and high doses are no more effective than lower doses for improving visceral and hematological pathologies. The proven effectiveness makes glucocerebrosidase the favorite therapy for these patients, but terminal mannose residues cannot be used to target the enzyme to other cells or organs or to enable treatment of other lysosomal storage disorders. Insufficient infused enzyme crosses the blood–brain barrier thus, the enzyme (Cerezyme) works very well for type I disease without neurological involvement but not for the less common Gaucher\\'s with neurological involvement. In addition, patients sometimes develop antibodies against the injected human protein.ERT trials with other recombinant lysosomal enzymes have progressed. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II, IVA, and VI and is under development for others. Combination therapy using ERT and a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize the therapeutic enzyme in the bloodstream is being considered. Recombinant α-galactosidase for Fabry disease works well and recombinant α-L-iduronidase for MPS I works very well with the intermediate severity form (Hurler–Scheie), but its effect is unclear for patients with the more common neurological form (Hurler syndrome). HSCT, presumably providing α-L-iduronidase in CNS from the donor-derived microglia, is effective to MPS I. Recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B; Naglazyme) was approved for MPS VI, as was α-glucosidase (Myozyme) for treating Pompe disease patients. Iduronic acid-2-sulfatase (Elaprase) is approved for treating Hunter syndrome. These results clearly validate this approach. The efficacy of most of these enzymes relies on the engineering of Man-6-P-containing glycans. This is one of the foremost examples of how the clinically motivated exploration of a disorder (I-cell disease) led to the discovery of Man-6-P-based targeting of lysosomal enzymes (Chapter 33) and the development of an entire industry targeting therapy for multiple diseases. The availability of animals deficient in specific lysosomal enzymes offers appropriate systems to test the efficacy of corrective genes, compounds, and enzymes.The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Junko Matsuda and Nathan Lewis.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Freeze, Richard Steet, and Taroh Kinoshita.This chapter discusses inherited human diseases that are caused by defects in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (congenital disorders of glycosylation, CDGs). Representative examples are described of genetic defects in the major glycan families and what lessons we can learn from them about glycobiology. Among genetic disorders of glycosylation, those caused by somatic mutations are described in Chapter 46. Disorders affecting the lysosomal degradation of glycans are described in Chapter 44. Although the term “congenital disorders” by definition include those caused by nongenetic, unfavorable in utero conditions, the term “congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)” is now widely used as an equivalent of inherited disorders of glycosylation.Following the discovery of the genetic defect in human I-cell disease in 1980 (Chapter 33) it was anticipated that many more human defects in glycan biosynthesis would be found, but more than a decade went by before the next example was found. In retrospect, the difficulty arose from the pleiotropic multisystem nature of the clinical presentations. Meanwhile Belgian pediatrician Jaak Jaeken noted unusual profiles of serum proteins in some children with multisystem disorders and decided to apply a previously established test to separate transferrin isoforms. The test was positive in these children, thereby, for the first time, indicating a generic defect in protein N-glycosylation. Lacking further details about glycan structures and the underlying genetic variants, Jaeken decided to call these cases “carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes” (CDGS). Several years later, many people defined primary inherited genetic defects in glycosylation pathways in many such cases. To keep the acronym “CDG,” those involved also decided to call them “congenital disorders of glycosylation,” rather than inherited genetic defects in glycosylation.Nearly all inherited disorders in glycan biosynthesis were discovered in the last 20 years. They are rare, biochemically and clinically heterogeneous, and usually affect multiple organ systems. CDGs are rare primarily because embryos with complete defects in a step of glycosylation do not usually survive to be born, documenting the critical biological roles of glycans in humans. CDG patients that survive are usually hypomorphic, retaining at least some activity of the pathways involved. Although rare, research on this group of genetically defined glycosylation disorders reveals important novel insights into the biology of the glycosylation process.Some defects strike only a single glycosylation pathway, whereas others impact several. Defects occur in (1) the activation, presentation, and transport of sugar precursors; (2) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases; and (3) proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery or maintain Golgi homeostasis. A few disorders can be treated by the consumption of monosaccharides. The rapid growth in the number of discovered disorders, shown in Figure 45.1, has resulted in an evolution of disease nomenclature. Since 1999, CDGs were defined as genetic defects in N-glycosylation, but now the term is applied to any glycosylation defect. Nowadays, CDGs are categorized in four groups, comprising defects in N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and lipid and GPI-anchor glycosylation and defects that impact multiple glycosylation pathways. CDGs are named by the mutated gene followed by “-CDG” suffix (e.g., PMM2-CDG). Selected disorders are listed in Table 45.1 and all known disorders in Online Appendix 45A.Glycosylation-related disorders. The graph shows the cumulative number of human glycosylation disorders in various biosynthetic pathways and the year of their identification. (For simplicity, disorders affecting multiple pathways are included in disorders (more...)Selected congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans The broad clinical features of disorders in which N-glycan biosynthesis is defective involve many organ systems, but are especially common in the central and peripheral nervous systems and hepatic, visual, and immune systems. The generality and variability of clinical features makes it difficult for physicians to recognize CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation. The first were identified in the early 1980s based primarily on deficiencies in multiple plasma glycoproteins. The patients were also delayed in reaching growth and developmental milestones and had low muscle tone, incomplete brain development, visual problems, coagulation defects, and endocrine abnormalities. However, many of these symptoms are also seen in patients with other multisystemic genetic syndromes. CDG patients with defective N-glycosylation can be distinguished because they often have abnormal glycosylation of common liver-derived serum proteins containing disialylated, biantennary N-glycans. Serum transferrin is especially convenient because it has two N-glycosylation sites, each normally containing disialylated, biantennary N-glycans. Different glycoforms can be resolved by isoelectric focusing (IEF) or ion-exchange chromatography, but better accuracy and sensitivity is achieved by mass spectrometry (MS) of purified transferrin. This simple test alerts physicians to likely CDG patients without knowing the genetic or molecular basis of the disease.N-glycosylation defects may be divided into two types based on transferrin glycoforms. Type I (CDG-I) patients lack one or both N-glycans because of defects in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) or its transfer to proteins. Type II (CDG-II) patients have incomplete protein-bound glycans because of abnormal processing. The biosynthetic pathways and locations of N-glycan defects are shown in Figure 45.2.Congenital disorders of glycosylation in the N-glycosylation pathway. The figure shows individual steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, glycan transfer to protein, and N-glycan processing similar to Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4. The shuttling (more...)A complete absence of N-glycans is lethal. Therefore, known mutations mostly generate hypomorphic alleles encoding proteins with diminished activity. A deficiency in any of the steps required for the assembly of LLOs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (e.g., nucleotide sugar synthesis or sugar addition catalyzed by a glycosyltransferase) (Chapter 9) produces a structurally incomplete LLO. Because the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) prefers full-sized LLO glycans, this results in hypoglycosylation of multiple glycoproteins. This means that some N-glycan sites are not modified. In recent years, it has been shown that some intermediate LLO structures can also be transferred to proteins, although with much lower efficiency. For example, low amounts of an extended chitobiose glycan were identified in ALG1-CDG, which is deficient in the mannosyltransferase that adds mannose to the chitobiose core. Importantly, many deficiencies in LLO synthesis produce incomplete LLO intermediates. Most of the LLO assembly steps are not easy to assay, but LLO assembly is conserved from yeast to humans, and intermediates that accumulate in CDG patients often correspond to the intermediates seen in mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with known defects in LLO assembly. Some mutant mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells) have been shown to have similar defects (Chapter 49). The close homology between yeast and human genes for ER N-glycosylation enables the normal human orthologs to rescue defective glycosylation in mutant yeast strains, whereas mutant orthologs from patients do not. This provides substantial clues to the likely human defect, along with a system in which to perform functional assays.PMM2-CDG in Table 45.1 is the most common CDG with more than 1000 cases identified worldwide. The patients have moderate to severe developmental and motor deficits, hypotonia, dysmorphic features, failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, and abnormal endocrine functions. More than 100 mutations found in phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) impair conversion of mannose-6-P (Man-6-P) to Man-1-P, which is a precursor required for the synthesis of GDP-mannose (GDP-Man) and dolichol-P-mannose (Dol-P-Man). Both donors are substrates for the mannosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol which is decreased in cells from PMM2-CDG patients. Patients have hypomorphic PMM2 alleles because complete loss of PMM2 function is lethal. Mouse embryos lacking Pmm2 die 2–4 days after fertilization, whereas some of those with hypomorphic alleles survive. There are currently no approved therapeutic options for PMM2-CDG patients.MPI-CDG (CDG-Ib) in Table 45.1 is caused by mutations in MPI (mannose-6-phosphate isomerase). This enzyme interconverts fructose-6-P and Man-6-P. In contrast to PMM2-CDG, these patients do not have intellectual disability or developmental abnormalities. Instead, they have impaired growth, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, severe vomiting and diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and hepatic fibrosis. Several patients died of severe bleeding before the basis of this CDG was known. Mannose dietary supplements effectively treat these patients. Man-6-P can be generated directly by hexokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of mannose (Chapter 5). This pathway is intact in MPI-CDG patients and its high activity in brain is thought to be the reason for the absence of neurological symptoms. Human plasma contains ∼50 µm mannose because of export following glycan degradation and processing. Mannose supplements correct coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, protein-losing enteropathy, and intermittent gastrointestinal problems, as well as normalize the glycosylation of plasma transferrin and other serum glycoproteins. Because orally administered mannose is well-tolerated, this approach is clearly a satisfyingly effective therapy for this life-threatening condition, although not curative for long-term symptoms.Patients with mutations in nearly all the remaining steps of LLO biogenesis have been found (Table 45.1; Online Appendix 45A; Figure 45.1) They have a broad range of clinical phenotypes including low low-density lipoprotein (LDL), low immunoglobulin G (IgG), kidney failure, genital hypoplasia, and cerebellar hypoplasia. The pathophysiology underlying these symptoms is still unknown. Defects in dolichol biosynthesis present with more specific symptoms as outlined below in the section Defects in Multiple Glycosylation Pathways. Mutations in six of the OST subunits also cause a CDG. The OST is a complex of multiple subunits of which STT3 is the catalytic subunit that contains OST activity. Two different genes encode STT3—namely, STT3A and STT3B. They are part of two different OST complexes, one with STT3A for cotranslational glycosylation and one with STT3B for glycosylation of proteins that escape glycosylation via the STT3A complex. Patients with defects in either subunit present with the typical multisystem phenotype. Interestingly, transferrin glycosylation is dependent on the STT3A-containing OST complex and thus abnormal in STT3A-CDG, but normal in STT3B-CDG. STT3B dependent protein substrates, such as sex hormone binding globulin, show reduced glycosylation in STT3B-CDG specifically. The phenotype of MAGT1-CDG is very different, presenting as a primary immunodeficiency characterized by chronic infections with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Transferrin glycosylation is abnormal in MAGT1-CDG. MAGT1 is an oxidoreductase that is mostly associated with the STT3B-OST complex. It is required for glycosylation of protein sequences containing cysteine residues. Reduced expression on natural killer cells of the NKG2D protein that requires MAGT1 for glycosylation is proposed to contribute to the immunodeficiency against EBV infections.Golgi disorders (Figure 45.2) affect N-glycan processing and include defects in glycosyltransferases, nucleotide sugar transporters, vacuolar pH regulators, and multiple cytoplasmic proteins that traffic glycosylation machinery within the cell and maintain Golgi homeostasis. Most of these processes are required for multiple glycosylation pathways and are discussed below (see the section Defects in Multiple Glycosylation Pathways).In B4GALT1-CDG, glycans show a dramatic loss of both galactose (Gal) and sialic acid (Sia) from transferrin because of deficient β1-4 galactosyltransferase activity. Patients present with a relatively mild clinical course without neurological symptoms, which can be explained by the fact that related genes are expressed in different tissues, such as B4GALT2 in the brain. A similar glycan pattern occurs in the X-linked SLC35A2-CDG, because of loss of UDP-Gal transporter activity. Surprisingly, within a few years after birth, abnormal glycosylation becomes normal. This is probably caused by somatic mosaicism of cells carrying the mutated SLC35A2 gene along with unaffected cells and by selection against the affected cells. Patients suffer from a mainly neurological phenotype. Defects in the glycosyltransferase MGAT2 and glycosidase MAN1B1 also result in characteristic glycan abnormalities on transferrin and other proteins that are now used to diagnose patients, whereas FUT8-CDG shows normal glycosylation of transferrin but severe fucosylation defects on total serum proteins. These CDGs present with neurological symptoms and other multisystem features, whereas MAN1B1-CDG additionally gives rise to obesity.Early on, it was assumed that glycosylation disorders would mainly result from defects in glycan biosynthetic enzymes, but that perspective has changed. Discovery of defects in Golgi organization and homeostasis, in ER chaperones such as COSMC or EDEM, and in ER quality control (such as EDEM-3-CDG) have broadened the perspective. A new defect in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) continuum (Chapter 39) is caused by mutations in NGLY1, an enzyme that cleaves N-glycans from misfolded glycoproteins transported into the cytoplasm before their proteasomal degradation (Table 45.1). NGLY1 defects do not appear to induce the ERAD pathway, accumulate undegraded glycoproteins in vesicles, or trigger autophagy. It is unclear how these defects cause symptoms such as developmental delay, movement disorder, seizures, and a curious lack of tear production, but their clinical similarity to other CDGs emphasizes that glycosylation defects cannot simply be divided into “synthesis” or “degradation.”Mutations altering O-Man glycans (Chapter 13), primarily on α-dystroglycan (α-DG), cause a range of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) termed dystroglycanopathies (Figure 45.3). α-DG at the sarcolemma links skeletal muscle cells to laminin in the extracellular matrix. A disruption of this linkage results in muscular dystrophy. Similarly, defective interaction of α-DG with other protein ligands in eye and brain results in a broad clinical spectrum of dystroglycanopathies, ranging from very severe, and often lethal, musculo-oculo-encephalopathies, such as Walker–Warburg syndrome (WWS), muscle–eye–brain disease (MEB), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), to milder forms of isolated limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in adults. Genetic analysis of these disorders has been indispensable for discovering α-DG\\'s functional glycans and their biosynthesis. The complex pathway is presented in Figure 45.3 and Chapter 13. The pathway is initiated in the ER by the transfer of mannose to Ser/Thr of α-DG via the protein O-mannosyltransferase complex POMT1/POMT2 (Table 45.1). In the Golgi, a polymer glycan (matriglycan) is generated, recognized by several diagnostic monoclonal antibodies and necessary for the binding of laminin and other molecules to α-DG. An unusual feature on one subset of O-Man glycans is the existence of a Man-6-P generated by the kinase POMK. The Man-6-P-containing Core M3 glycan consists of Man-6-P, GlcNAc (transferred by POMGNT2), and GalNAc (transferred by B3GALNT2). The trisaccharide core is extended by two units of ribitol-5-phosphate sequentially transferred by FKTN (fukutin) and FKRP (fukutin-related protein) from CDP-ribitol, which is generated by CRPPA. This “core” glycan is elongated by an alternating disaccharide (β1-3Xylα1-3GlcA) to form matriglycan.O-Man glycan biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthetic pathways of representative O-Man glycans are shown. Enzymes whose defects cause a disorder are indicated in red. Three main groups are identified: cores M1–M3. All O-Man glycans are initiated (more...)O-Man glycans can also play a traitorous role, because they are receptor molecules for Lassa virus entry into cells. This feature was cleverly exploited to screen libraries and identify genes required for virus entry. The method correctly identified all previously known WWS-causing genes and predicted new culprits. Dystroglycanopathies can be divided into primary (caused by mutations in the DAG1 gene, encoding the α-DG core protein), secondary (caused by mutations in one of 11 glycosyltransferases [POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, POMGNT2, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE1, RXYLT1, B3GALNT2, POMK, or B4GAT1]) or tertiary (caused by defects in the synthesis of sugar building blocks [CRPPA for CDP-ribitol, GMPPB, DOLK, DPM1, DPM2, and DPM3 for Dol-P-Man]).WWS is the most severe CMD. Patients live about one year and have multiple brain abnormalities, and severe muscular dystrophy. About 20% of patients have mutations in POMT1 and a few have mutations in POMT2. Others have defects in FKTN and FKRP, but mutations in both also cause milder forms of muscular dystrophy. POMGNT1 is mutated in MEB, which is characterized by symptoms similar to, but milder than, WWS. The most severely affected MEB patients die during the first years of life, but the majority of mild cases survive to adulthood. FCMD is caused by a single 3-kb 3′-retrotransposon insertional event into the FKTN gene, which occurred 2000–2500 years ago. This partially reduces the stability of the mRNA, making it a relatively mild mutation. FCMD is one of the most common types of CMD in Japan with a carrier frequency of 1/188. Fktn-null mice die by E9.5 in embryogenesis and appear to have basement membrane defects. Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C (MDC1C) is a relatively mild disorder that is caused by mutations in FKRP. Patients with MDC1D, a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, contain mutations in LARGE1, originally described in myodystrophic mice (myd; now called Largemyd). The protein has two glycosyltransferase signatures (DXD) in different domains that account for xylosyl- and glucuronosyl-transferase activities, respectively (Chapter 13).Polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (ppGalNAcTs) are required for initiation of mucin type O-glycosylation (Chapter 10). Clinical phenotypes of defects in this family of enzymes depend on their tissue-specific expression and substrate specificity. A defect in O-GalNAc synthesis by a particular polypeptide GalNAc-transferase (GALNT3) causes familial tumoral calcinosis. This severe autosomal-recessive metabolic disorder causes phosphatemia and massive calcium deposits in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Mutations in the O-glycosylated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) also cause phosphatemia, and further research has shown that ppGALNT3 glycosylates FGF23. Mutations in GALNT2, which encodes a ubiquitous ppGalNAcT, result in a multisystem neurological disease with remarkably low HDL cholesterol. Further research identified ANGPTL3 and APOCIII as substrates, the latter of which can be used for easy diagnostic screening by IEF. Tn syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease, is caused by somatic mutations in the X-linked gene C1GALT1C1, which encodes a highly specific chaperone COSMC required for the proper folding and normal activity of the β1-3galactosyltransferase C1GALT1, needed for synthesis of core 1 and 2 O-glycans (Chapters 10 and 46).The identification of patients with defects in other types of O-glycosylation (O-glucose, O-fucose, and O-GlcNAc) highlights the physiological importance of this class of glycans (Chapter 13). Each of these O-glycans is found on certain epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch receptors, and mutations in the glycosyltransferases that modify NOTCH1 have been identified in different diseases, including Dowling–Degos disease (caused by haploinsufficiency of POFUT1 or POGLUT1), a form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (caused by autosomal-recessive mutations in POGLUT1), Adams–Oliver syndrome (autosomal-recessive mutations in EOGT), and some cancers (amplification, gain or loss-of-function of POFUT1, Fringe GlcNAc-transferases, POGLUT1, MGAT3). Mutations in OGT, encoding the GlcNAc-transferase that acts on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 18), cause intellectual disability. The mutations cluster in the region encoding TRP-repeats of the OGT enzyme, implicating altered substrate recognition and O-GlcNAc modification of specific cytosolic and nuclear proteins as a pathogenic mediator.Proteoglycans and their GAG chains are critical components in extracellular matrices. For a discussion of their biosynthesis, core proteins, and function, see Chapter 17. Genetic defects in GAG synthesis can be divided into so-called linkeropathies, because of defects in the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker, defects in the synthesis of the polysaccharides, and defects in GAG modification, mainly sulfation.Genetic defects have been reported for all enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the linker tetrasaccharide (XYLT1, XYLT2, B4GALT7, B3GALT6, B3GAT3), linking the core proteins to the glycosaminoglycan. Skeletal and bone defects, joint laxity, and short stature are characteristic symptoms for this group of diseases. Bikunin has been used as a plasma proteoglycan marker for the biochemical confirmation of defects in this group of GAG biosynthesis defects. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (progeroid type) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by failure to thrive, loose skin, skeletal abnormalities, hypotonia, and hypermobile joints, together with delayed motor development and delayed speech. The molecular basis of the disorder is reduced synthesis of the core region of GAGs initiated by Xyl. Galactosyltransferase I (B4GALT7) the enzyme that adds Gal to Xyl-Ser is mutated in this disease. A defect in the phosphorylation of the core xylose sugar by mutations in FAM20B results in Desbuquois dysplasia, a disease characterized by dwarfism, joint laxity, and skeletal abnormalities. This also shows the importance of Xyl phosphorylation in the regulation of GAG biosynthesis.Linker elongation produces different polysaccharides, such as heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Defects in the formation of heparan sulfate (HS) cause hereditary multiple exocytosis (HME), an autosomal-dominant disease with a prevalence of about 1:50,000 births (Table 45.1). It is caused by mutations in one of two genes, EXT1 or EXT2, that are both involved in HS synthesis. HME patients have bony outgrowths, usually at the growth plates of the long bones. Normally, the growth plate contains chondrocytes in various stages of development, which are enmeshed in an ordered matrix composed of collagen and chondroitin sulfate (CS). In HME, however, the outgrowths are often capped by disorganized, cartilaginous masses with chondrocytes in different stages of development. About 1%–2% of patients also develop osteosarcoma. HME mutations occur in EXT1 (60%–70%) or EXT2 (30%–40%). The encoded proteins probably form a complex in the Golgi as both are required for polymerizing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)α1-4 and glucuronic acid (GlcA)β1-3 into HS. However, the partial loss of one allele of either gene appears sufficient to cause HME. This means that haploinsufficiency decreases the amount of HS, and that EXT activity is rate-limiting for HS biosynthesis. This is unusual because most glycan biosynthetic enzymes are in substantial excess. Defects in GAG biosynthesis may also be caused by a lack of available nucleotide sugars. Defects in the UDP-GlcA/UDP-GalNAc Golgi transporter (SLC35D1) cause Schneckenbecken dysplasia. Patients have bone abnormalities similar to those seen in other chrondrodysplasias, and a mouse model of the disease shows similar features.Modification of GAGs by sulfation is important for several functions. Three autosomal-recessive disorders—diastrophic dystrophy (DTD), atelosteogenesis type II (AOII), and achondrogenesis type IB (ACG-IB)—result from defective cartilage proteoglycan sulfation. These forms of osteochondrodysplasia have various outcomes. AOII and ACG-IB are perinatal lethal because of respiratory insufficiency, whereas DTD patients develop symptoms only in cartilage and bone, including cleft palate, club feet, and other skeletal abnormalities. Those DTD patients surviving infancy often live a nearly normal life span. All of these disorders result from different mutations in the DTD gene (SLC26A2), which encodes a plasma membrane sulfate transporter. Unlike monosaccharides, sulfate released from degraded macromolecules in the lysosome is not salvaged well. The heavy demand for sulfate in bone and cartilage proteoglycan synthesis probably explains why the symptoms are most evident in these locations.Complete deletion of the GPI pathway in mice causes embryonic lethality. This is not surprising because more than 150 membrane proteins require a GPI anchor for cell surface expression (Chapter 12). Hypomorphic mutations in multiple genes in the pathway lead to a partial reduction in GPI-anchored proteins. These include PIGA, PIGH, PIGQ, PIGY, PIGC, PIGP, PIGL, PIGW, PIGM, PIGV, PIGB, PIGF, and PIGO in GPI-anchor assembly (Table 45.1), and PIGK, GPAA1, PIGS, PIGT, and PIGU in the transfer of the GPI anchor to proteins. Defects in side-chain modifications (PIGN and PIGG) and maturation of the GPI glycan following attachment to proteins (PGAP1, PGAP2, and PGAP3) also cause inherited GPI deficiency, but not embryonic death. GPI deficiency has immense and variable consequences including neurologic symptoms, particularly developmental delay/intellectual disability and seizures, epileptic encephalopathy, progressive cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, cortical visual impairment, sensorineural deafness, and Hirschsprung disease. Nonneurologic phenotypes include brachytelephalangy, anorectal anomaly, renal abnormality, cleft palate, heart defect, and characteristic facial features such as hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, and tented mouth. Other symptoms such as ichthyosis, iron deposition, hepatosplenomegaly, diaphragmatic hernia, and hepatic and/or portal vein thrombosis are reported in small fractions of the affected individuals. It is not easy to causally relate specific symptoms to deficiency of particular GPI-anchored proteins except in a few instances. Deficiency of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNALP) accounts for seizures in some patients. Death within a year after birth due to aspiration or status epilepticus is not rare among severely affected individuals with GPI deficiency, whereas mildly affected individuals can live with a GPI deficiency.Only three disorders in GSL synthesis (Chapter 11) are known in humans. Mutations in ST3GAL5 cause autosomal-recessive, Amish infantile epilepsy syndrome and also “salt-and-pepper syndrome.” This gene encodes a sialyltransferase required for the synthesis of the ganglioside GM3 (Siaα2-3Galβ1-4Glc-ceramide) from lactosylceramide (Galβ1-4Glc-ceramide). GM3 is also a precursor for some more complex gangliosides. The patients’ plasma GSLs are nonsialylated. In contrast to the human form of the disease, mice that lack GM3 do not have seizures or a shortened life span. However, mouse strains that are null for the sialyltransferase and an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that is required for making other complex gangliosides do develop seizures, suggesting that it is the absence of these more complex gangliosides that may be the underlying problem (Chapter 11). Mutations in B4GALNT1 (also known as GM2/GD2 synthase) cause hereditary spastic paraplegia subtype 26 (SPG26). These patients have developmental delays and varying cognitive impairments with early-onset progressive spasticity owing to axonal degeneration. Cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, cortical atrophy, and white-matter hyperintensities are also consistent across the disorder. A B4galnt1−/− mouse recapitulates several of the neurological characteristics of SPG26, most prominently the progressive gait disorder.ST3GAL3 makes more complex gangliosides as well as N- and O-glycans. It is required for the development of high cognitive functions and is mutated in some individuals with West syndrome. An St3gal3−/− mouse model also exists, but these mice appear to have no overt neurological phenotype. GSL disorders are difficult to identify biochemically because no convenient biomarker tests have been developed. Therefore, novel genetic defects are likely to be found via next-generation sequencing.Sugar metabolism is essential to produce nucleotide sugars and dolichol-linked sugars for glycosylation reactions in the ER and Golgi. Because activated sugars are required to synthesize multiple glycan classes, genetic disorders affect multiple pathways. Below, some defects in the mannose, galactose, Sia, and fucose sugar activating pathways are discussed.Galactosemia refers to mutations in three genes involved in Gal metabolism. In “classical galactosemia,” Gal-1-P uridyltransferase (GALT; Figure 45.4) is deficient. This results in excess Gal-1-P and decreased synthesis and availability of UDP-Gal. Defects in UDP-Gal-4′-epimerase (GALE; Figure 45.4) or galactokinase (GALK; Figure 45.4) also cause the disease, but they are rarer.CDGs related with UDP-Gal metabolism. The most common form of galactosemia is caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). This enzyme uses Gal-1-P derived from dietary Gal. In the absence of GALT, Gal-1-P accumulates along (more...)GALT-deficient infants fail to thrive and have an enlarged liver, jaundice, and cataracts. A lactose-free diet ameliorates most of the acute symptoms by reducing the amount of Gal entering the pathway and the accumulation of Gal and Gal-1-P. Reducing Gal decreases galactitol and galactonate, which are produced via reductive or oxidative metabolism of Gal, respectively. Galactitol is not metabolized further and has osmotic properties that contribute to cataract formation. Unfortunately, a Gal-free diet apparently does not prevent the appearance of cognitive disability, ataxia, growth retardation, and ovarian dysfunction that are characteristic of this disease. Abnormal glycosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids has been observed in some GALT-deficient individuals; however, this has not been directly related to a lack of galactose. For example, some patients who mistakenly are given Gal or those before start of a Gal-free diet synthesize transferrin that is missing both N-glycans. In GALT deficiency, a Gal-free diet normalizes glycosylation. However, dietary supplementation with Gal was found to be an effective treatment for some of the symptoms in another CDG, PGM1-CDG. In PGM1-CDG, phosphoglucomutase activity results in a reduction of UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc, leading to hypogalactosylation and missing N-glycans. These biochemical abnormalities are restored by Gal feeding. Clinically, the hypoglycemia, liver and coagulation abnormalities, and gonadal hormones improved on treatment. Still, the exercise intolerance and dilated cardiomyopathy, linked to other functions of PGM1, did not improve.Disorders in four of the Sia biosynthesis enzymes (Chapter 15) are known, resulting in rather different phenotypes. Recessive mutations in GNE cause adult-onset GNE myopathy (previously named hereditary inclusion body myopathy type 2 [HIBM2] or Nonaka myopathy) (Table 45.1). It occurs worldwide, but one mutation (p.Met745Thr) is especially common among Persian Jews (1:1500) and occurs in the kinase domain (Chapter 5). GNE mutations occur in various combinations in both GNE enzymatic domains and variably affect enzyme activity. The mutations moderately reduce enzymatic activity and reduce sialylation in mouse models. Oral ManNAc, as precursor for Sia synthesis, is being tested as a therapy for GNE myopathy patients, as well as for patients with primary glomerular diseases (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy). Recessive mutations in other genes—NANS, CMAS, and SLC35A1—result in a neurological phenotype with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Additionally, varying degrees of thrombocytopenia may be seen. Interestingly, specific mutations in the GNE gene also give rise to a thrombocytopenia syndrome without the presence of neurological symptoms. The biological mechanism behind these differences is not yet understood. The catabolism of Sia is executed by neuraminate pyruvate lyase (NPL), the role of which was unknown in humans until the identification of a human genetic disease. Recessive mutations in NPL result in a phenotype of myopathy and cardiomyopathy, possibly indicating a role of Sia in (cardiac) muscle besides glycosylation.GDP-Fucose (Fuc) can be synthesized from GDP-Man or obtained via fucose salvage. In the salvage pathway, Fuc is converted into Fuc-1-P by fucose kinase and then to GDP-Fuc by GDP-Fuc pyrophosphorylase (Chapter 5). The contribution of the endogenous versus the salvage pathway in different cells and tissues is not yet known. A disease in the salvage pathway has been reported due to mutations in FCSK (fucose kinase), resulting in a severe neurological syndrome with encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability. Patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD-II or SLC35C1-CDG) have mutations in SLC35C1, encoding the GDP-Fuc transporter in the Golgi. Here, transferrin sialylation was normal, so this defect was not detected by the usual test, but some serum proteins and O-linked glycans on leukocyte surface proteins were deficient in Fuc. One leukocyte protein carries a selectin ligand glycan, sialyl-Lewis x, that mediates leukocyte rolling before extravasation of leukocytes from capillaries into tissues (Chapter 34). This defect greatly elevates circulating leukocytes and decreases leukocyte extravasation, so patients have frequent infections. A few patients responded to dietary fucose therapy. Sialyl-Lewis x reappeared on their leukocytes, and circulating neutrophils promptly returned to normal levels. Fucose supplements must increase the amount of GDP-Fuc enough to correct the defect. A mouse model of Fuc deficiency lacks de novo biosynthesis of GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man (Chapter 5). The mice die without Fuc supplements, but providing Fuc in the drinking water rapidly normalizes their elevated neutrophils. The treatment also corrects abnormal hematopoiesis resulting from disrupted O-Fuc-dependent Notch signaling.Numerous defects in the biosynthesis of dolichol, the primary lipid carrier for monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in glycosylation, have been identified. These disorders share many of the features of other CDGs, although some of the mutations are associated with more specific phenotypes. As an example, variants in DHDDS have been identified in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, and heterozygous variants in NUS1 have been found in patients with various neurological phenotypes. The NUS1 and DHDDS gene products are involved in the initial steps of dolichol synthesis. The two proteins form a complex with cis-prenyltransferase activity that catalyzes polyprenolpyrophosphate formation. SRD5A3 acts as a polyprenol reductase to form dolichol (Chapter 9). This dolichol is then phosphorylated by DOLK to make the activated lipid, dolichol-phosphate, on which both monosaccharide and oligosaccharide precursors are built. Although the primary functions of dolichol-linked sugars lie within the N-glycosylation pathway, Dol-P-Glc and Dol-P-Man are both integral for different O-glycosylation pathways, and Dol-P-Man is required for biosynthesis of GPI. Clinical symptoms of some of these defects, including muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with DPM1-3 and DOLK defects, have been associated with abnormal O-mannosylation of dystroglycan.The discovery of CDG defects associated with trafficking proteins showed that the abnormal glycosylation linked to these disorders could arise from alterations in Golgi homeostasis and not only from impairment of the enzymes and transporters needed for glycosylation (Figure 45.5). Among the first of these trafficking proteins identified are subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex has multiple roles in trafficking within the Golgi, including the tethering of COPI-coated vesicles and recycling of Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases. COG7-CDG (Table 45.1) was discovered first. Trafficking of multiple glycosyltransferases and nucleotide sugar transporters were disrupted in COG7-CDG. The mutation affects the synthesis of both N- and O-glycans and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Mutations have now been found in all COG subunits except COG3. Mammalian cells deficient in the different COG subunits also show various degrees of altered glycosylation.Golgi homeostasis defects. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are also caused by defects in proteins and transporters that control Golgi homeostasis. These CDGs include members of the vesicle tethering conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, (more...)An unusual disorder called HEMPAS (hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with positive acidified-serum test) leads to abnormal red cell shape and instability (hemolysis) caused by mutations in SEC23B, another intracellular trafficking protein that produces abnormal red blood cell glycans in several pathways.In addition to trafficking proteins, a number of mutations in Golgi-associated ion transporters and vacuolar H+-ATPase subunits have also been shown to disrupt multiple glycosylation pathways, presumably because of an increase in Golgi pH, decrease in metal ion-dependent glycosyltransferase activities, or a more general disruption in Golgi recycling. Mutations in two Golgi manganese transporters, TMEM165 and ZIP8 (SLC39A8), cause CDGs highlighting the role of manganese homeostasis in glycosylation.Expression of the same CDG mutation can have highly variable impacts, even among affected siblings. Explanations based on residual activity from hypomorphic alleles of these “simple Mendelian disorders” are neither simple nor generally satisfying. The variability is often attributed to “genetic background.” A knockout mutation may be lethal in one highly inbred mouse strain, but not in another because compensatory pathways exist in the latter. Dietary and environmental impacts are substantial as seen in MPI-CDG patients treated by oral mannose therapy. Multiple simultaneous or sequential environmental insults may impinge on borderline genetic insufficiencies to produce overt disease. A major question for future investigations is how CDG defects cause pathology. Addressing this challenge will require the implementation of analytical approaches like glycomics and glycoproteomics and of model systems that allow identification of sensitive pathways and glycoproteins in affected tissues.In an interesting twist, it is possible to have diseases caused by “excessive” glycosylation. For example, Marfan syndrome results from mutations in fibrillin1 (FBN1) and one of these creates an N-glycosylation site that disrupts multimeric assembly of FBN1. This may not be an isolated case. A survey of nearly 600 known pathological mutations in proteins traveling the ER–Golgi pathway showed that 13% of them create novel glycosylation sites. This is far greater than predicted by random missense mutations and may mean that hyperglycosylation leads to a new class of CDGs.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Harry Schachter and Bobby G.

Freeze.Many acquired changes in glycan synthesis, turnover/degradation, or recognition are involved in human diseases. Knowing these changes can improve disease diagnosis and/or therapies. This chapter lists a few examples, proposes mechanisms, and suggests novel therapies. Glycosylation changes in cancer and in inherited human genetic disorders of glycosylation are discussed in more depth in Chapters 47 and 45, respectively.Vascular thrombotic events such as stroke and myocardial infarction, plus others including acute ischemic injury (e.g., trauma, hypovolemic shock), temporarily interrupt of blood flow that must be fixed quickly. Natural or medical interventions that restore blood flow suddenly reintroduce leukocytes to the traumatized tissue and can cause tissue damage called “reperfusion injury.” Selectins, cell adhesion molecules that are C-type lectins (Chapter 34), play major roles in this process. L-Selectin (CD62L) on leukocytes and P-selectin (CD62P) on the activated endothelium in the reperfused area initiate this cascade, and E-selectin (CD62E) participates later; however, among the selectins, the E-selectin-based leukocyte recruitment in humans (and primates, in general) is more prominent and sustained than in other mammals because the promoter region of the human E-selectin gene, but not that of P-selectin, contains elements responsive to inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1 (and to bacterial products like LPS). These increase transcription and expression of E-selectin (Chapter 34), whereas the P-selectin promoter in humans actually dampens gene transcription in response to such mediators. However, in mice, the promoters for both the P-selectin and E-selectin genes retain TNF/IL-1/LPS responsive elements, and mice thus display inflammation-driven inducible endothelial expression of both P-selectin and E-selectin. This regulatory distinction is critical in considering whether rodent models of P-selectin biology may reflect human pathophysiology. Nonetheless, animal models show that blocking initial selectin-based interactions ameliorates subsequent tissue damage. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have made small-molecule inhibitors and biologics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) to block these interactions in patients, and this approach has shown benefit and has achieved U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval for clinical indications such as sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises (further described below; Chapters 55 and 57 also discuss selectin inhibitors). In addition, many preparations of the already-approved drug heparin can block P- and L-selectin interactions, but its dampening effects on reperfusion injury remain to be established.Heart attacks, strokes, and other serious vascular diseases are associated with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These molecules increase the risk of atherosclerotic lesions in the large arteries. Atherosclerotic lesions begin with the development of the “fatty streak,” in which monocytes enter into the subendothelial regions of the blood vessels. This process involves expression of P- and/or E-selectin on the endothelium, which recognizes glycosylated and sulfated P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) or sialyl Lewis x (“sLex”; CD15s) displayed on discrete glycoproteins and glycolipids of circulating monocytes. Indeed, P-selectin deficiency in mice delays progression of atherosclerotic lesions, which slows even more in combined P- and E-selectin-deficient mice. Oxidized lipids in LDL particles or inflammatory processes likely induces endothelial E-selectin in the early atheromatous plaque. Early intervention may be possible because these lesions develop slowly and relatively early in life. Retention of LDLs in the early plaque probably involves binding to proteoglycans and subsequent oxidation and uptake by macrophages and smooth-muscle cells. Clusters of basic amino acid residues in apolipoprotein B (the protein moiety of LDL) likely bind to the glycosaminoglycans. This binding also has a physiological function. Heparan sulfate (HS) found in the liver sinusoids regulates the turnover of lipoprotein particles. Reduced sialylation of LDL in patients also correlates with coronary artery disease. Although the mechanism(s) remain unclear, desialylated LDL may be more easily taken up and incorporated into atheromatous plaques. The nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc (enriched in red meats; see Chapter 15) can be metabolically incorporated into plaques, and recognition by circulating antibodies against Neu5Gc glycans may accelerate disease progression via chronic inflammation.The oral cavity contains numerous host and microbial glycans and glycan-binding proteins (Chapter 21). Dental caries and gingivitis involve certain viridans group streptococci that have serine-rich bacterial proteins whose stability requires O-glycosylation. They also have a carbohydrate recognition domain that recognizes O-linked sialoglycans or oral mucins to allow attachment to cells in the mucosa. If these bacteria reach the bloodstream, particularly during dental procedures, the same binding proteins recognize platelet specific glycoproteins such as GPIbα, delivering the bacteria to damaged heart valves, and leading to the serious disease of bacterial endocarditis.In humans, E-selectin is constitutively expressed on microvessels of the skin, recruiting both adaptive and innate immune effector cells. E-selectin is up-regulated in all inflammatory skin diseases, further promoting extravasation of circulating leukocytes containing sLex. Dermal lymphocytes are recognized by the monoclonal antibody “HECA452” that binds sLex. This “cutaneous lymphocyte antigen” is displayed on glycoforms of PSGL-1, CD43, and CD44 molecules (sLex-decorated CD44 is called hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand (HCELL)) (Chapter 34). In mice, both E-selectin and P-selectin are constitutively expressed on dermal microvessels. In humans, T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes access the skin via binding to E-selectin, suggesting that blocking this interaction could treat dermal inflammatory diseases.Diabetes mellitus causes long-term vascular complications, in part by increasing nonenzymatic glycation (not to be confused with glycosyltransferase-mediated glycosylation), wherein the open-chain (aldehyde) form of glucose reacts with lysine residues generating reversible Schiff bases that can rearrange to generate “browning” (Maillard) reactions and permanent cross-linked advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These adducts impair protein and cellular functions, disrupting the function of extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., collagen), contribute to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer\\'s disease), and bind to receptors, such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and also the macrophage scavenger receptor that participates in atherogenesis. Notably, glycation of hemoglobin generates “Hemoglobin A1c,” the biomarker for measuring long-term glucose control in diabetics.Excess glucose increases UDP-GlcNAc through the glucosamine:fructose aminotransferase (GFAT) pathway, enhancing hyaluronan production (Chapter 16) and O-GlcNAcylation of multiple proteins that, in turn, alters their phosphorylation and functions (Chapter 19). In animal models, altered O-GlcNAcylation correlates with complications, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy (increased O-GlcNAcylation of various nuclear proteins) and erectile dysfunction (O-GlcNAcylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase). Several cytoplasmic proteins involved in insulin receptor signaling and the resulting nuclear transcription changes are themselves O-GlcNAcylated and functionally altered in diabetes.Kidney dysfunction is a very serious, potentially lethal, diabetic complication. Progressive albumin excretion eventually leads to nephrotic syndrome and to end-stage renal disease. This proteinuria correlates with reduced HS proteoglycan in the glomerular basement membrane. Reduced HS synthesis by glomerular epithelial cells may result from exposure to high glucose or increased porosity of the glomerular basement membrane. High glucose also increases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene expression in renal glomerular mesangial cells, via O-GlcNAc-mediated alterations in Sp1 transcriptional activity.Numerous gastrointestinal pathogens or the products they secrete recognize and bind to gut mucosal glycans (Chapter 37). For example, cholera toxin (CT) secreted by Vibrio cholerae can bind GM1 ganglioside, and Helicobacter pylori, the cause of peptic ulcers and gastritis, binds Lewis type glycans in the stomach mucosa. Soluble glycan inhibitors could block binding of these gut pathogens. This could explain that a time-honored treatment for peptic ulcers (before the identification of H. pylori) was a combination of antacids and milk (which contains large amounts of free sialyloligosaccharides). Cholera infection outcomes are correlated with ABO(H) blood group expression. Blood group O(H) individuals are not more frequently infected, but experience more severe disease. Although GM1 is the primary functional ligand for CT, recent studies have suggested that CT also has a binding site for the H antigen, possibly explaining this association.Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is the enteric loss of plasma proteins; however, its mechanisms are not well-understood. Some patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib (CDG-Ib or MPI-CDG) and CDG-Ic (ALG6-CDG) (Chapter 45) develop PLE, suggesting involvement of N-glycosylation. But other patients with normal N-glycosylation also develop PLE many years following (Fontan) surgery to correct congenital heart malformations. What causes this type of PLE? One concept is that environmental stress such as infections increase inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which, together with increased venous pressure resulting from the surgery, contribute to PLE. In both the N-glycosylation disorders and post-Fontan surgery patients, HS is lost from the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells and returns when PLE subsides. HS binds cytokines, and its loss may increase the impact of inflammation at the cell surface and promote leakage. Combining increased venous pressure and cytokines along with localized HS depletion creates a downward spiral of disease. Traditional therapy for PLE includes albumin infusions, steroid hormones, or other anti-inflammatory drugs, but, interestingly, heparin injections can also reduce PLE, possibly by binding to and reducing circulating cytokines (Chapter 38).Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease typically affecting the superficial epithelial layer of the rectum and the distal colon. The primary cause of the disease is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors, such as changes in the microbiome, are involved and remissions and exacerbations are common. Normally, colonic mucosal proteins display heavily O-acetylated sialic acids, but these acetyl groups are diminished in ulcerative colitis. Whether this contributes to the pathology is unknown, but O-acetylated sialic acids are more resistant to bacterial sialidases (Chapter 15). Decreased sialic acid O-acetylation is also a feature of colon carcinomas.Heparin (a highly sulfated form of HS; Chapter 17) is a therapeutic agent extracted from porcine intestines or bovine lungs. It is a fast-acting and potent anticoagulant often used to avoid thrombosis, in procedures including dialysis and open-heart surgery. Its effectiveness relies on a specific sulfated heparin pentasaccharide that binds circulating antithrombin III and markedly enhances its ability to inactivate coagulation Factors Xa and IIa (thrombin) (Chapter 17). Animal-derived “unfractionated heparin” is now often replaced with low-molecular-weight heparins because they have fewer complications. One explanation is that the unfractionated heparin effects on thrombin require a long chain that interacts both with the antithrombin and with thrombin itself in a tripartite complex. In contrast, the shorter chains found in low-molecular-weight heparins only facilitate antithrombin inactivation of Factor Xa. Thus, low-molecular-weight heparins affect Xa but not thrombin activity. A synthetic pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) that binds and facilitates antithrombin inactivation of Factor Xa is an alternative to heparin. Although these improvements are valuable, unfractionated heparin has a variety of other biological effects besides anticoagulation. Thus, other beneficial effects of heparin, such as the blocking of P- and L-selectin, are reduced or even eliminated by the switch to low-molecular-weight heparins and the synthetic pentasaccharide.An uncommon but feared complication of heparin treatment is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). During HIT, complexes between heparin and platelet factor-4 form, and the de novo formed pathogenic antibodies against these complexes deposit on platelets, causing their aggregation and loss from circulation. Paradoxically, this process results in exaggerated thrombosis, rather than bleeding. The incidence of this complication is lower with low-molecular-weight heparins and significantly curtailed with the use of the pure pentasaccharide.Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin that leads to various acute and chronic painful complications. Symptoms were thought to be caused by vaso-occlusion due to abnormally shaped and/or membrane-modified hypoxic erythrocytes. Now, it is clear that abnormal adhesion of multiple cell types is responsible, and that this is partially mediated by selectins. Blocking selectin action with analogs of natural ligands such as sLex or heparin can restore blood flow in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. A pan-selectin inhibitor (GMI-1070, “rivipansel”) has undergone clinical trials for reduction of severity and duration of sickle cell crisis. Notably, glycopeptide mimetics of PSGL-1 and antibodies that block PSGL-1-P-selectin interactions (e.g., FDA-approved crizanlizumab) can mitigate sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises.Blood transfusion medicine first identified the ABO blood group system, defined by differential expression of α-GalNAc and α-Gal transferases across populations (Chapter 14). These and other less prominent glycan antigens can cause hemolytic transfusion and rejection reactions, mostly because of errors in blood typing. Although anti-A and anti-B titers likely influence transfusion and transplantation outcomes, simple assessment of antibody levels fails to fully account for the clinical impact(s) of an ABO(H) incompatible transfusion. Efforts to generate “universal donor” red blood cells, via enzymatic conversion of blood group A and B antigens to the O state using bacterial enzymes, are underway.Occasionally, patients with diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma spontaneously secrete a circulating anticoagulant and have an unusual coagulation test profile that makes it appear as if the patient has been treated with heparin. The anticoagulant activity can be purified from the plasma and has been identified as an HS glycosaminoglycan. Its source is unknown and therapy is difficult without correcting the underlying disease or transplanting the liver.Plasma fibrinogen is heavily sialylated, and the sialic acids are involved in binding calcium. Certain genetic disorders of fibrinogen are associated with altered sialylation of its N-glycans, which causes altered function in clotting. Patients with hepatomas and other liver disorders can also sometimes manifest increased branching and/or number of N-glycans on fibrinogen, resulting in an overall increase in sialic acid content. This altered fibrinogen sialylation can present clinically as a bleeding disorder associated with a prolonged thrombin time. Patients with CDGs affecting N-glycan biosynthesis (Chapter 45) can also have thrombotic or bleeding disorders that are partly explained by altered glycosylation of plasma proteins and/or platelets involved in blood coagulation.Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an unusual form of acquired hemolytic anemia (excessive destruction of red blood cells) that usually appears in adults and arises through a somatic mutation in bone marrow stem cells generating one or more abnormal clones. The defect is an inactivation of the single active copy of the PIGA gene, an X-linked locus involved in the first stage of biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (for details on GPI anchor biosynthesis, see Chapter 12). Although several blood cell types show abnormalities, the red cell defect is the most prominent, being characterized by an abnormal susceptibility to the action of complement. This is now known to be caused by the lack of expression of certain GPI-anchored proteins, such as the decay accelerating factor and CD59, that normally down-regulate complement activation on “self” surfaces. However, hypercoagulability also occurs, presumably because of loss of GPI-anchored proteins on other cells, such as monocytes and platelets. Interestingly, many of these patients had preceding, or later development of, bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia). Some of the latter also develop acute leukemia. Most normal humans already have a tiny fraction of circulating cells with a PIGA mutation, the PNH defect. These presumably represent the products of one or more bone marrow stem cells that develop this acquired defect because of a single hit on the active X chromosome but then do not become prominent contributors to the total pool of circulating red blood cells. In this scenario, the independent occurrence of a process damaging the proliferation of other (unaffected) stem cells allows the “unmasking” of the PNH defect.Patients with the rare disorder paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria have a cold-induced intravascular destruction of red cells (hemolysis). This hemolysis appears to be caused by a complement-fixing circulating IgG antibody directed against the red cell P blood group antigens that binds more efficiently at temperatures below the core body temperature of 37°C (such as within appendices) (Chapter 14). Biosynthesis of the P blood group antigens is dependent on the B3GALNT1 (β1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1) and A4GALT (α1-4-galactosyltransferase) genes. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, but it tends to occur in the setting of some viral infections and in syphilis. The IgG antibody presence is detected by the so-called “Donath–Landsteiner test,” in which the patient\\'s serum is mixed either with the patient\\'s own red cells or with those from a normal person and chilled to 4°C. Complement-mediated hemolysis occurs after warming to 37°C.Cold agglutinin disease is caused by autoimmune IgM antibodies directed against glycan epitopes on erythrocytes. High titers of IgM agglutinins are present in serum and are maximally active at 4°C. The IgMs are presumed to bind to erythrocytes that are circulating in the cooled blood of peripheral regions of the body. The antibody fixes complement, which then destroys the cells when they reach warmer areas of the body. There are several variants of the syndrome. One affects young adults and follows infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Epstein–Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis). This antibody is characteristically polyclonal, and is generally short-lived, disappearing when the infection subsides. An idiopathic variant of cold agglutinin disease affects older individuals, involves a monoclonal IgM, and can be a precursor or an accompaniment to a lymphoproliferative disease such as Waldenström\\'s macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or other lymphomas. These antibodies are typically directed against the “I” antigen (β1-6-branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine) present on glycolipids and glycoproteins of erythrocytes (Chapter 14). Fewer less common variants of cold agglutinin disease involve antibodies directed against sialylated N-acetyllactosamines. In some patients on chronic hemodialysis, the syndrome occurs because of the formation of antibody directed against the sialylated blood group antigen N.In this condition a subset of bone marrow–derived blood cells express the Tn antigen (O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr) and sialyl-Tn (NeuAcα2-6GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr), thus becoming susceptible to hemagglutination by naturally occurring anti-Tn antibodies that exist in most normal humans. The underlying defect is a somatic stem cell–based loss of expression of the O-glycan core-1 β1-3 galactosyltransferase activity (also called the T synthase) (Chapter 10). This in turn is explained by acquired inactivation of Cosmc, a chaperone required for the biosynthesis of the T synthase. As with PNH, the existence of the C1GALT1C1 gene encoding Cosmc on the X chromosome allows a single hit on the active X chromosome to cause a glycosylation defect in a single bone marrow stem cell. Some patients are picked up simply because polyagglutinability of their red blood cells is detected when blood typing is performed for a possible transfusion. Others have varying degrees of hemolytic anemia and/or decreases in other blood cell types. Some subsequently progress into frank leukemia. It is unclear how the primary syndrome predisposes to development of malignancy. As with PNH, the possibility exists that an underlying bone marrow disorder simply allows the “unmasking” of preexisting minor stem cell clones along with the defect. In keeping with this notion, leukemic clones that arise later may not have the same defect.The sialylation of platelets regulates their count and production (thrombopoiesis). Aging platelets lose sialic acid moieties and are consequently cleared by multiple Gal- and GalNAc-recognizing lectins, including the Ashwell–Morell receptor (AMR) (Chapter 34) and the macrophage galactose lectin (MGL). Some patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) express sialidase NEU1 on their platelet surface. Influenza antiviral drugs including anamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and peramivir (Rapivab) mimic the transition state to block viral neuraminidase (Chapter 55). Administration of oseltamivir increases platelet counts in a cohort of patients with ITP and in healthy human subjects, suggesting that platelet sialic acid regulates platelet count. Loss of platelet sialic acid and thrombocytopenia can occur in patients with genetic mutations in sialylation, such as GNE, which makes a precursor of sialic acids. Mutations in the CMP-Sia transporter gene SLC35A1 results in macrothrombocytopenia because of increased clearance. Mouse models such as sialyltransferase ST3GalIV knockout mice have profound thrombocytopenia. Crossing ST3GalIV-deficient mice with AMR-null mice results in platelet count recovery, implying that uncovering of galactose leads to AMR-mediated clearance. Multiple changes in O-glycans can also produce severe thrombocytopenia, including deficits in sialyltransferase ST3GalI, GalNT3, C1GalT1 or its chaperone, Cosmc.IgG immunoglobulins are N-glycosylated, and those in the constant (CH2 or Fc) region of human IgG have several unusual properties. First, they are buried between the folds of the two constant regions. Second, the crystal structure of the protein shows that they are immobilized by glycan–protein interactions. Third, the IgG complex-type biantennary N-glycans are rarely fully sialylated, and instead have one or two terminal β-linked galactose residues (termed G1 and G2, respectively). IgG from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have even less galactose or none at all (termed G0). The severity of this inflammatory disease tends to correlate inversely with the level of galactosylation. Spontaneous clinical improvement occurs during pregnancy and correlates with restored galactosylation. The basis of the decreased galactosylation in RA is unknown. Some evidence points to less β-galactosyltransferase activity in patients’ lymphocytes, but whether altered glycosylation of IgG has a specific pathogenic role in rheumatoid arthritis is debatable, because G0 molecules are seen in other diseases including granulomatous diseases (e.g., tuberculosis) and Crohn\\'s disease. The glycan changes are also seen to a lesser extent in osteoarthritis, a form of chronic degenerative arthritis with a different pathogenesis. One function attributed to the Fc N-glycans is to maintain the conformation of the Fc domains as well as the hinge regions. Other structural features are also necessary for effector functions such as complement and Fc receptor binding and Fc-dependent cytotoxicity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies show that the G0 N-glycans have an increased mobility resulting from the loss of interactions between the glycan and the Fc protein surface. Thus, it is thought that regions of the protein surface normally covered by the glycan are exposed in rheumatoid arthritis. Some studies suggest that the circulating mannose-binding protein recognizes the more mobile G0 N-glycan and activates complement directly. Rheumatoid arthritis patients also have increased circulating immune complexes consisting of antibody molecules (called rheumatoid factor) that recognize the Fc regions of other IgG molecules. However, the epitopes involved do not seem to be glycan-related. Another likely possibility is that the altered glycosylation changes interactions with Fc receptors.Glycans and their binding proteins are key to the pathogenicity of essentially all infectious diseases, and this topic is covered in greater detail in Chapters 37, 42, and 43. Some key physiologic effects of glycan–host interactions are briefly covered here.Many urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, which adhere to bladder epithelial cells via a mannose-binding lectin, FimH, located on the F-pilus of the bacterium. A simple and effective antibiotic-independent treatment and prevention for this very common infection is drinking D-mannose because it competes bacterial glycan binding to the urinary tract when it is excreted in the urine. Another alternative is optimized synthetic α-mannosides, which could treat and prevent UTIs.Many pathogens initiate infection by binding to host cell-surface glycans (Chapter 37). Variable expression of these glycans may explain an individual\\'s susceptibility to infection. For example, some pathogenic strains of E. coli infect the urinary tract using a lectin that binds the P blood group antigens (Chapter 14), with P negative individuals being immune. The E. coli P fimbriae lectins are also involved in spreading bacterial infections from the kidney to the bloodstream.Binding of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, to its ACE2 receptor on host epithelial cells first involves its initial binding to neighboring HS glycosaminoglycan chains, which induces a conformational change to enhance binding to ACE2. Importantly, mutations that alter spike glycosylation sites (e.g., variant B.1.1.7 (N501Y)) impact infectivity.Some pathogenic microorganisms secrete sialidases (neuraminidases), which usually remain at the site of infection. However, in some severe cases (e.g., Clostridium perfringens–mediated gas gangrene), sialidases reach the plasma where they desialylate red cells, resulting in clearance and anemia. Measuring plasma sialidase may aid diagnosis and prognosis. Similarly, the action of viral (e.g., influenza and dengue) or bacterial (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) sialidases causes loss of platelet sialic acid and contributes to increased platelet clearance. Sialidase-producing S. pneumoniae can also cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, and selectively inhibiting sialidase could have therapeutic value. Paradoxically, the thrombocytopenia resulting from desialylation of platelets predisposes to bleeding but may serve to protect against sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.Nephrotic syndrome occurs when the kidney glomerulus fails to retain serum proteins during initial filtration of plasma, allowing these proteins to leak into the urine. The epithelial/endothelial mucin molecule called podocalyxin on the foot processes (pedicles) of glomerular podocytes helps maintain pore integrity and excludes proteins from the glomerular filtrate. Sialic acids on podocalyxin are critical for this function. Loss of sialic acid is seen in spontaneous minimal-change renal disease in children and in the nephrotic syndrome that follows some bacterial infections. Animal models seem to mimic this situation with proteinuria and renal failure developing in a dose-dependent manner after a single injection of V. cholerae sialidase, which correlated with loss of sialic acids from the glomerulus. This was accompanied by effacement of foot processes and the alteration of tight junctions between podocytes. The anionic charge returned to endothelial and epithelial sites within two days, but the foot process loss remained. Another model is aminonucleoside nephrosis, induced in rats by injection of puromycin. Again, defective sialylation of podocalyxin and glomerular glycosphingolipids is seen in this model. A genetic mouse model with impaired sialic acid synthesis (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase [GNE] deficiency) dies soon after birth because of kidney dysfunction and undersialylated podocalyxin.In humans, all immunoglobulin classes contain N-glycans in the Fc domain, but only IgA1 and IgD contain O-glycans (localized within the hinge regions). The IgA1 O-glycan chains are thought to stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. IgA nephropathy is a form of glomerulonephritis caused by the deposition of aggregated IgA1 molecules within the glomerulus, and patients with this condition harbor circulating IgA1 with O-glycan truncations. Underglycosylated IgA1 has the tendency to both self-aggregate as well as trigger immune reactions leading to IgG-IgA complexes, and both processes lead to glomerular IgA1 deposits. The primary mechanism of underglycosylation remains unknown. One possible scenario is a defect in the C1GALT1C1 gene that encodes Cosmc, similar to that found in the Tn polyagglutinability syndrome (see above). Instead of affecting a bone marrow stem cell, the defect would presumably involve a clone of B cells that specifically expresses underglycosylated IgA1.In chronic kidney disease, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have indicated that deficiency in polypeptide GalNAc-transferase 11 (GALNT11) may be etiologic. GALNT11 adds O-GalNAc to LRP2 (megalin), a major endocytic receptor within renal proximal tubules. Studies with GALNT11 knockout mice have shown a critical role of LRP2 O-glycans in mediating its protein resorption function and, also, in preventing its loss with age.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder in which antigen–antibody complexes accumulate in various organs, especially the skin and kidney. How SLE begins is unknown, but the pathology may involve both cytokines and HS. HS is reduced on the glomerular basement membrane, and this was thought to result from masking of HS by complexes of nucleosomes and antinuclear antibodies, but the actual mechanism(s) is likely to be more complex. Even though anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies are the hallmark of SLE, circulating antibodies to HS strongly correlate with disease activity. In some studies, HS injections into dogs induce SLE symptoms within several weeks, and elevated HS is found in the urine of SLE patients, especially in severe cases. Some SLE patients also develop protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), perhaps as a consequence of misplaced or degraded HS and elevated cytokines, creating the appropriate environment for PLE (see above).A variety of diseases are associated with circulating antibodies directed against specific glycan molecules enriched in the nervous system, resulting in autoimmune neural damage. Such antibodies can arise via distinct pathogenic mechanisms. In the first situation, patients with benign or malignant B-cell neoplasms (e.g., benign monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance [MGUS], Waldenström\\'s macroglobulinemia, or plasma cell myeloma) secrete monoclonal IgM or IgA antibodies that are specific for either gangliosides or, more commonly, for sulfated glucuronosyl glycans (the so-called HNK-1 epitope). These antibodies react with glycolipids bearing the epitope 3-O-SO3-GlcAβ1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc-Cer (3′sulfoglucuronosylparagloboside) and against the N-glycans on a variety of central nervous system (CNS) glycoproteins (MAG, P0, L1, N-CAM) that bear the same terminal sequence. The resulting peripheral demyelinating neuropathy can sometimes be more damaging than the primary disease itself. Therapy consists of attempts to treat the primary disease with chemotherapy or to remove the immunoglobulin by plasmapheresis. Both approaches are usually unsuccessful at lowering the immunoglobulin to a level sufficiently to diminish the symptoms. The second situation is an immune reaction to molecular mimicry of neural ganglioside structures by the lipo-oligosaccharides of bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni. Following an intestinal infection with such organisms, circulating cross-reacting antibodies against gangliosides such as GM1 and GQ1b appear in the plasma. These are associated with the onset of symptoms of peripheral demyelinating neuropathy involving the peripheral or cranial nerves (the Guillain–Barré and Miller Fisher syndromes, respectively). The third situation is a human-induced disease arising from attempts to treat patients with stroke using intravenous injections of mixed bovine brain gangliosides. Although some evidence for benefits was seen, several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were reported as a likely side effect. One explanation is that the presence of small amounts of gangliosides with the nonhuman sialic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), facilitates formation of antibodies that cross-react with gangliosides containing the human sialic acid Neu5Ac.Alzheimer\\'s disease is a common primary degenerative dementia of humans, with an insidious onset and a progressive course. The ultimate diagnosis is made by postmortem histological examination of brain tissue, which shows characteristic amyloid plaques with neurofibrillary tangles that are associated with neuronal death. Several types of glycans have been implicated in the histopathogenesis of the lesions: O-GlcNAc and HS glycosaminoglycans. Paired helical filaments are major component of the neurofibrillary tangle. These are primarily composed of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, which is present in an abnormally hyperphosphorylated state. This hyperphosphorylated Tau no longer binds microtubules and self-assembles to form the paired helical filaments that may contribute to neuronal death. Normal brain Tau is known to be heavily modified by Ser(Thr)-linked O-GlcNAc, the dynamic and abundant posttranslational modification that is often reciprocal to Ser(Thr) phosphorylation (Chapter 19). The hypothesis currently being investigated is that site-specific or stoichiometric changes in O-GlcNAc addition may modulate Tau function and may also play a part in the formation of paired helical filaments by allowing excessive phosphorylation. Inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase that cross the blood–brain barrier are now in clinical trials.HS proteoglycans may also have an important role in amyloid plaque deposition as investigators have shown high-affinity binding between HS proteoglycans and the amyloid precursor, as well as with the A4 peptide derived from the precursor. In addition, a specific vascular HS proteoglycan found in senile plaques bound with high affinity to two amyloid protein precursors. Further studies to determine the pathological roles of HS proteoglycans in Alzheimer\\'s disease are needed. Recently, GWASs showed a strong correlation between Alzheimer\\'s disease and the higher expression of a truncated form of CD33 (Siglec-3), which is expressed in brain microglia and may be suppressing clearance of amyloid.Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, but only certain specific glycan changes are frequently associated with tumors (for details, see Chapter 47). Findings include (1) increased β1-6GlcNAc branching of N-glycans; (2) changes in the amount, linkage, and acetylation of sialic acids; (3) truncation of O-glycans, leading to expression of Tn and sialyl Tn antigens, as well as N-glycan truncation yielding paucimannosidic glycans; (4) expression of the nonhuman sialic acid, Neu5Gc, incorporated from dietary sources; (5) expression of sialylated Lewis structures and selectin ligands; (6) altered expression and enhanced shedding of glycosphingolipids; (7) increased expression of galectins and poly-N-acetyllactosamines; (8) altered expression of ABH(O) blood-group-related structures; (9) alterations in sulfation of glycosaminoglycans; (10) increased expression of hyaluronan; (11) increased expression of the enzyme that attaches GPI anchors to proteins; and (12) increased O-GlcNAcylation on many proteins. Some of these changes have been shown to have pathophysiological significance in model tumor systems, and some are targets for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cancer. For example, the principal serum diagnostic/prognostic indicator of adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract is the biomarker known as “CA19-9” which is the tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis a (sLea), a binding determinant for E-selectin; its isomer, sLex, is displayed on bone marrow progenitors and by engagement with marrow microvessel E-selectin mediates hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.Asthma is characterized by sporadic recurrent hyperresponsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli, resulting in widespread narrowing of the airways. The two dominant pathological features are airway wall inflammation and luminal obstruction of the airways by inflammatory exudates, consisting predominantly of mucins. Most cases are due to antigen-specific IgE antibodies, which bind to mast cells as well as to basophils and certain other cell types. Antigens can cross-link adjacent IgE molecules, triggering an explosive release of vasoactive, bronchoactive, and chemotactic agents from mast cell granules into the extracellular milieu. Eosinophils also contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma in several ways, by synthesizing leukotrienes, stimulating histamine release from mast cells and basophils, providing a positive feedback loop, and releasing major basic protein, a granule-derived protein that has toxic effects on the respiratory epithelium. Underlying all this, it appears that CD4+ Th2 cells are responsible for orchestrating the responses of other cell types. Recent evidence indicates that the selectins are intimately involved in recruitment of eosinophils and basophils (and possibly T lymphocytes) into the lung, raising the hope that small-molecule inhibitors of selectin function and/or heparin can be used to treat the early stages of an asthmatic attack. Likewise, chemokine interactions with HS are important in leukocyte trafficking. Evidence from Siglec-F knockout mice also indicates that the functionally equivalent human paralog Siglec-8 is a good target for reducing the contributions of eosinophils to the pathology (Chapter 35). Finally, the large increase in mucus production is at least partly mediated by an up-regulation of synthesis of mucin polypeptides, under the influence of various cytokines that stimulate the goblet cells of the airway epithelium.Shock, trauma, or sepsis can all cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. Diffuse pulmonary endothelial injury causes pulmonary edema because of increased capillary permeability. Selectins and integrins help arrest neutrophils on the injured endothelium where they release injurious oxidants, proteolytic enzymes, and arachidonic acid metabolites, resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction and destruction. Bronchoalveolar lavage is rich in neutrophils and their secreted products documenting the inflammatory response. Here again, giving small molecule selectin inhibitors and/or heparin before serious lung damage and respiratory failure is a possible therapy.Cystic fibrosis is a common genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This causes defective chloride conduction across the apical membrane of involved epithelial cells. Cystic fibrosis is associated with increased accumulation of viscous mucins in the pancreas, gut, and lungs, which leads to many symptoms of the disease. There are known to be widespread increases in sialylation, sulfation, and fucosylation of mucin glycoproteins. One possible explanation is that the primary CFTR defect allows a higher Golgi pH, resulting in abnormalities in glycosylation: however, there is controversy about this conclusion. Curiously, the CFTR is mainly expressed within nonciliated epithelial cells, duct cells, and serous cells of the tubular glands, but not highly expressed in the goblet cells and mucous glands of the acinar cells, which are the cells that synthesize respiratory mucins. Thus, the CFTR mutation may indirectly affect mucin glycosylation through the generation of inflammatory responses and/or changes in pH or chloride secretion. Another major cause of morbidity in the disease is the colonization of respiratory epithelium by an alginate-producing form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Certain glycolipids and mucin glycans have been suggested to be the Pseudomonas receptors that help to maintain the colonization. The changes in glycolipid and mucin glycosylation could enhance production of potential binding targets for organ colonization by the bacteria. The presence of bacterial products is also a proinflammatory condition, because the bacterial capsular polysaccharides may activate Toll-like receptors and lead eventually to neutrophil accumulation and organ damage.Pulmonary vascular diseases include pulmonary embolism, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and arteriovenous malformations. These diseases increase pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, ultimately leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. PAH is the best studied—a progressive disease that shows nitric oxide deficiency, vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and enhanced vascular remodeling. Among other factors, dysregulated glucose metabolism may drive an increased flux into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This results in PAH patients having increased hyaluronan in lung tissue, plasma, and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. It also increases O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, a process shown to regulate pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation associated with PAH progression, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Morten Thaysen-Andersen and Priya Umapathi.Because of the wide range of topics covered in this chapter, it is not feasible to provide literature citations for all of them.

Reis, Ajit Varki, Reiji Kannagi, and Pamela Stanley.Altered glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, and certain glycans are well-known markers of tumor progression. This chapter discusses glycan biosynthetic pathways that are altered in cancer cells; correlations between altered glycosylation, diagnosis, and clinical prognosis; the genetic bases of some of these changes; and the functional role of glycans in cancer biology and pathogenesis.The earliest evidence of altered glycosylation as a hallmark of cancer was that some plant lectins show enhanced binding and agglutination of tumor cells. Next, it was found that transformation of cultured cells is frequently accompanied by a general increase in the size of glycopeptides of cell-surface glycoproteins. With the advent of monoclonal antibody technology, many “tumor-specific” antibodies directed against glycan epitopes were found. In many instances, these epitopes represented “oncofetal antigens”—that is, glycan epitopes expressed on tumor cells and embryonic tissues. Like normal cells during embryogenesis, tumor cells also undergo rapid growth and invade tissues. Correlations between certain types of altered glycosylation and the prognosis of tumor-bearing animals or patients increased interest in glycan changes. In vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies have now supported the conclusion that glycan changes are critical to several aspects of tumor cell behavior.Glycan changes in malignant cells take a variety of forms: loss of expression or excessive expression of certain glycans, increased expression of incomplete or truncated glycans, and, less commonly, the appearance of novel glycans. However, this is not simply the random consequence of disordered biosynthesis in tumor cells. It is striking that a very limited subset of changes are correlated with malignant transformation and tumor progression, highlighting a potential functional role in tumor biology. Given that cancer is a “microevolutionary” process in which only the fittest cells survive, and that tumors are under immune surveillance pressure, it is likely that these specific glycan changes are selected for during tumor progression.Classic reports of increased size of tumor cell glycopeptides have now been partly explained by an increase in β1-6 branching of N-glycans (Figure 47.1), resulting from enhanced expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V, MGAT5) (Chapter 9). Increased transcription of the MGAT5 gene is induced by various oncogenic transcription factors, as well as viral- and chemical-induced carcinogenesis. Cells with up-regulated MGAT5 show an increased frequency of metastasis in mice, and spontaneous revertants lacking MGAT5 lose the metastatic phenotype. Overexpression of MGAT5 in cultured cells causes a transformed phenotype, whereas Mgat5-deficient mice show a striking reduction in the growth and metastasis of mammary tumors induced by a viral oncogene. Increased expression of MGAT4 to form a β1-4 branched tetra-antennary N-glycan also enhances tumor progression. Possible mechanisms by which increased N-glycan branching and extension enhances progression include lattice formation via galectin binding to poly-N-acetyllactosamines (LacNAc) leading to prolonged growth factor signaling, and the generation of sialyl-Lewis x (SLex) tetrasaccharides recognized by selectins because of increased outer-chain sialylation and fucosylation (Figure 47.1). Increased expression of FUT8 that transfers the core Fuc to N-glycans (Figure 47.1) is also observed in solid tumors and promotes tumor progression in lung cancer and melanoma. The expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III, MGAT3) that catalyzes the transfer of β1-4GlcNAc to Man on N-glycans to form the bisecting GlcNAc (Figure 47.1) is up-regulated in rat hepatomas and mouse mammary tumors. However, in this case, tumor progression is suppressed by the presence of N-glycans with the bisecting GlcNAc. Mice lacking MGAT3 show increased mammary tumors and lung metastases, whereas high MGAT3 expression correlates with better relapse-free survival in human breast cancer. However, liver tumors are reduced in mice lacking MGAT3, and MGAT3 activity endows ovarian cancer cells with cancer stem cell features. Thus, the effects of MGAT3 on cancer progression depend on tissue context.N-Glycans increase in size on neoplastic transformation of cells, in part because of increased MGAT4 and MGAT5 activity, which catalyzes GlcNAc branching of N-glycans. This may lead to increased numbers of LacNAc units, which can also be sialylated and (more...)Mucins are large glycoproteins rich in O-GalNAc glycans on Ser or Thr in tandem repeat regions (Chapter 10). In normal polarized epithelium, mucins are expressed in the apical membrane, facing the lumen of a hollow organ, and soluble mucins are secreted exclusively into the lumen. Loss of adhesion junctions and topology in malignant epithelial cells destroys polarization, allowing mucins to enter the extracellular space and the blood. Loss of polarization and overexpression of mucins displaying aberrant glycosylation has made these glycoproteins a major source of biomarkers with clinical applications. The rod-like structure and negative charge of mucins are thought to repel intercellular interactions and sterically inhibit adhesion molecules such as cadherins and integrins from carrying out their functions. Thus, mucins may act as “antiadhesins” to promote displacement of a cell from the primary tumor during the initiation of metastasis. Tumor mucins bearing selectin ligands facilitate several aspects of cancer progression (see below). Mucins might also interfere with immune cell recognition and block or mask presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.A hallmark feature of carcinomas is the aberrant synthesis of incomplete O-glycans, present in mucins and other glycoproteins, typified by the Tn and T antigens and their sialylated glycoforms, sialyl-Tn (STn) and sialyl-T (ST) (Figure 47.2). Secreted glycoproteins expressing STn often appear in the bloodstream of patients with cancer. Because these glycans occur infrequently in normal tissues, they serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Truncated O-glycans evoke immune responses in the patient, and accordingly, vaccines against these glycans have been developed. As an alternative, incomplete O-glycans can serve as targets for a variety of therapeutic antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The appearance of excessive Tn and STn on tumor cells correlates in some instances with silencing of the COSMC gene (C1GALT1C1). The β1-3 galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) that synthesizes Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr requires the chaperone C1GALT1C1 for activity. The gene for C1GALT1C1 is on the X chromosome, thus a single mutation may be sufficient to eliminate expression. In other instances, STn accumulation results from overexpression of the sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC1 (Figure 47.2). The expression of Tn and STn can enhance tumorigenic and invasive properties, and promote immunosuppression.Loss of normal topology and polarization of epithelial cells in cancer results in secretion of mucins with truncated O-GalNAc glycans, such as sialyl-Tn (STn) and Tn, into the bloodstream. Tumor cells invading tissues and the bloodstream also present (more...)Sialylation is generally increased in tumor cells, both on N-glycans and O-glycans. N-glycan sialylation serves as a regulatory mechanism for multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, illustrated by activation of MET and RON receptors by α2-3Sia. Increased α2-6Sia on N-glycans, due to ST6GAL1 up-regulation in cancer cells, enhances integrin-mediated cell motility and protects cells against apoptosis induced by galectins, death receptor ligands, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Additionally, some receptor glycoproteins and their downstream signaling pathways are dysregulated by addition of SLex and sialyl-Lewis a (SLea) structures on either N- or O-glycans. Other functions for tumor cell Sias include binding to factor H to limit complement activation and modulation of tumor cell attachment to matrix, facilitating invasion and metastasis. As well, tumor cell Sias play a prominent role in suppressing antitumor immunity through engagement of inhibitory Siglecs (Chapter 35), which are Sia-recognizing receptors expressed primarily on immune cells. There can also be changes in Sia modifications in tumor cells. Sia 9-O-acetylation can be increased (e.g., 9-O-acetylated GD3 [Figure 47.3] in melanoma cells) or decreased (e.g., on the O-glycans of colon carcinomas). Some tumor cells express small amounts of de-N-acetyl (deNAc) gangliosides (Figure 47.3). O-Acetylation of gangliosides appears to protect tumor cells from apoptosis, and de-N-acetylgangliosides may activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).Gangliosides expressed in human neuroectodermal tumors. Heavy arrows indicate up-regulated reactions; dashed arrow indicates a potential reaction. O-Acetylation of Sia can occur at the 7- or 9-position. An O-acetyl group at position 7 will migrate to (more...)Many years ago, cancer patients were reported to express “Hanganutziu–Deicher” antibodies, which were later shown to recognize gangliosides carrying the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which was also found in human tumors. This unusual phenomenon has now been explained by the metabolic incorporation of diet-derived Neu5Gc into human glycans (Chapter 15). This Sia differs from the common human Sia, Neu5Ac, by addition of a single oxygen atom (Figure 47.3). Humans show variable levels of circulating antibodies against Neu5Gc-containing epitopes. The resulting weak immune response (termed “xenosialitis”) can promote tumor growth by enhancing chronic inflammation and angiogenesis. Given this selective advantage, it is not surprising that tumors are better at accumulating Neu5Gc in the face of an increased immune response. Because the primary dietary source of Neu5Gc is red meat, this may help explain the increased cancer risk associated with its consumption.SLex and SLea epitopes (Chapter 14) were first identified as tumor antigens on glycosphingolipids. Expression of these antigens by epithelial carcinomas correlates with metastatic potential in mice and with tumor progression, metastatic spread, and poor prognosis in humans. SLex and SLea epitopes on glycoprotein ligands are key recognition determinants of the selectins (Chapter 34). Indeed, selectin ligands are expressed on carcinoma cells, and mucin-like tumor antigens carrying SLex and SLea are found in the blood of carcinoma patients (Figure 47.4). Transgenic overexpression of E-selectin in mouse liver causes carcinoma cells that would normally metastasize to the lung to be redirected toward colonization of the liver, supporting the concept that SLe/selectin interactions are important mediators of metastasis. Furthermore, metastasis is attenuated in mice lacking P-selectin or L-selectin or by administering heparin, which blocks binding by these selectins. Selectin interactions also help explain the classic observation that cancer cells entering the bloodstream form thromboemboli with platelets and leukocytes, which facilitate arrest in the vasculature, assist extravasation through the endothelium, and help in evasion of the immune system. Similar interactions involving soluble cancer mucins may contribute to hypercoagulability (Trousseau\\'s syndrome), a condition responsive to heparin treatment. Because of the prominent role of selectins in cancer progression, these receptors are major therapeutic targets (see below). Certain sialyl-Lewis-related structures may also influence carcinoma progression by interacting with Siglecs, which generally have immunosuppressive functions. For example, disialyl-Lea and sialyl-6-sulfo-Lex structures may protect against early carcinogenic events by binding to Siglec-7 on macrophages. This interaction suppresses macrophage production of the pro-oncogenic inflammatory mediator, Cox2, thereby exerting an anti-oncogenic function. However, during cancer development, many other sialylated glycan ligands for Siglecs are increased, and these bind to inhibitory Siglecs on various immune cell populations to induce immunosuppression and facilitate tumor progression.In normal physiology platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells interact via selectins and selectin ligands. In invasive carcinoma, interactions that promote invasion occur between tumor cells expressing selectin ligands and selectins on endothelial (more...)Loss of AB blood group expression in the context of carcinoma (accompanied by exposure of underlying H and Ley epitopes) (Chapter 14) is associated with poor prognosis. The Sda (or Cad) antigen, a blood group glycan abundantly expressed in the colon, is lost in colon carcinoma. Sulfation of the C-3 position of terminal Gal residues is also reduced in cancers. Sialyl-6-sulfo-Lewis x and disialyl-Lewis a, expressed on colonic epithelial cells, are reduced in colon cancer cells. These changes may reflect the enhanced production of SLex and SLea in cancers. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, epigenetic mechanisms for suppression of gene transcription commonly observed in cancers, are proposed to underlie these glycan alterations. There are also rare instances in which a tumor may present a “forbidden” blood group structure (i.e., expression of a B blood group antigen in an A-positive patient) (Chapter 14). Regardless of the underlying mechanism, tumor regression has been noted in a few such cases, presumably mediated by the naturally occurring endogenous antibodies directed against the foreign structure.Many “tumor-specific” monoclonal antibodies raised against cancer cells recognize the glycan portion of glycosphingolipids. Some glycolipids are highly enriched in specific cancers (e.g., Gb3/CD77 in Burkitt\\'s lymphoma and GM3, GD2, and GD3 in melanomas) (Figure 47.3). Several types of tumors (particularly melanoma and neuroblastoma) are characterized by the synthesis of very high levels of gangliosides (Chapter 11). Some of these (e.g., GD2) are not normally found at high levels in extraneural tissues and are therefore targets for both passive immunotherapy (monoclonal antibody infusion) and active immunotherapy (immunization with purified glycolipids). In some cases, gangliosides are also major carriers of modified Sias (Figure 47.3). Cell culture studies suggest that some gangliosides promote tumor cell growth and invasion. As a principal constituent of lipid raft membrane microdomains, gangliosides modulate cell signaling by numerous receptors. Additionally, gangliosides shed by some tumors appear to have immunosuppressive effects.A complete loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins is seen in some cases of malignant and premalignant states involving the hematopoietic system. This results from acquired mutations in hematopoietic stem cells in the PIGA gene (required for an early step in GPI-anchor biosynthesis [Chapter 12]). Conversely, some GPI-anchored proteins, such as members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, like CEACAM5 (CEA), are overexpressed in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, and female reproductive system, among others. Members of the CEACAM family have been implicated in tumor biology via interference with the integrin signaling pathway.Many classes of malignant tumors express high levels of hyaluronan, a large negatively charged polysaccharide composed of the repeating disaccharide unit [GlcAβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4]n (Chapter 16). In carcinomas, hyaluronan is localized near the tumor cell surface, and is also enriched in tumor-associated stroma. In normal tissues, hyaluronan serves at least three functions, which may also contribute to tumor progression. First, it increases tissue hydration, facilitating cell movement through tissues. Second, it is intrinsic to the assembly of extracellular matrices through specific interactions with other macromolecules, and thus it participates in tumor cell–matrix interactions that facilitate or inhibit tumor cell survival and invasion. Finally, hyaluronan interacts with several types of cell-surface receptors, especially CD44, which mediate or modify cell signaling pathways. These interactions, notably with alternatively spliced isoforms of CD44 that are elevated in most cancer cells, are often crucial to tumor malignancy and are a current target for novel therapies.In normal adult tissues, hyaluronan appears to be relatively inert with respect to cell signaling and behavior. However, during embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and in various pathologies, hyaluronan-CD44 signaling becomes activated, possibly because of limited cleavage of hyaluronan by hyaluronidases. The consequences of this signaling are dramatic because they promote cell proliferation, survival, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion, which are key elements of the malignant phenotype (Figure 47.5). Hyaluronan–CD44 interactions are required for the constitutive activation of some oncogenes, especially receptor tyrosine kinases such as ERBB2, which is amplified or mutated in numerous carcinomas. Accordingly, hyaluronan–CD44 interaction promotes downstream intracellular pathways that are also hallmarks of cancer, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Antagonists of hyaluronan–CD44 interaction cause inactivation of these pathways in malignant cells in culture and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in animal models. Hyaluronan–CD44 interaction also stimulates multidrug resistance, and antagonists sensitize resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, interactions of hyaluronan with its receptors are important for the activities of several types of metabolic and multidrug transporters. These widespread effects may be due to stabilization of signaling platforms in the plasma membrane (e.g., lipid rafts) that are dependent on multivalent interactions of hyaluronan with CD44 or, in some cases, with another hyaluronan receptor (e.g., LYVE-1 or RHAMM/CD168) (Figure 47.5).Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in cancer. (A) Hyaluronan interacts multivalently with CD44, which interacts with several types of signaling molecules in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, thus promoting cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal (more...)Proteoglycans are comprised of core proteins decorated with negatively charged, sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains—namely, chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), keratan sulfate (KS), and heparan sulfate (HS) (Chapter 17). The content and distribution of many proteoglycans are altered during tumorigenesis, and the structurally and functionally diverse GAGs, particularly HS chains, have been implicated in tumor pathogenesis. HS chains are covalently linked to the core protein of proteoglycans (e.g., syndecans, glypicans, and perlecan). Other proteoglycans such as decorin, biglycan, versican, and lumican, carrying CS, DS, or KS chains, are also present in most tissues, including many tumor types.Major functions of HS proteoglycans relevant to tumor formation are to promote cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions important in tissue assembly and to bind a wide array of bioactive factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor, WNT, and numerous other cytokines and chemokines. Thus, HS proteoglycans can serve to build either inhibitory barriers or permissive pathways for cell invasion and can either sequester factors away from their receptors or present them efficaciously to those receptors (Figure 47.5). Syndecan-1 illustrates the multiple important roles of HS, especially in promoting metastasis and angiogenesis. Early work suggested that syndecan-1 helps maintain the normal differentiated state of epithelia and that low levels of tumor-associated syndecan-1 correlate with malignancy. The biological activity of syndecan-1 (and other HS proteoglycans) is influenced by enzymatic processing by proteases and heparanase, an enzyme that cleaves the HS chains at specific sites. High levels of proteolytically released HS-rich ectodomain fragments of syndecan are present in sera of patients with myeloma as well as some types of carcinoma and predict poor prognosis. Syndecan-1 ectodomains also accumulate in the tumor microenvironment, in which they play an important role in activation of both chemokine and growth factor signaling, and consequently tumor cell behavior. Especially significant is the finding that ectodomains promote metastasis to bone tissue, which is characteristic of myeloma and certain carcinomas (e.g., of breast or prostate) in human patients.HS side chains of several HS proteoglycans are cleaved to fragments containing 10 to 20 sugar moieties by heparanase and endo-β-glucuronidase. Heparanase is elevated in numerous types of cancer, and increased heparanase activity can lead to induction of angiogenesis and metastasis, processes associated with a poor prognosis. HS cleavage promotes blood vessel remodeling required for angiogenesis and release of HS-bound angiogenic factors, growth factors, and chemokines. Furthermore, heparanase products are more bioactive compared with intact HS proteoglycan. Heparanase trimming of syndecan-1 HS chains and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in myeloma cells results in enhanced shedding of syndecan-1, activating signaling pathways that promote cell migration and angiogenesis. Notably, in addition to their roles in regulating tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, heparanase and syndecans cooperate in regulating extracellular vesicle secretion by tumor cells. The therapeutic targeting of heparanase has potential to not only block tumor growth, but also interfere with the tumor microenvironment.Along with HS cleavage, modifications in the sulfation pattern of HS, and other GAG chains, are important contributors to tumor biology. GAG sulfation patterns often determine their biological function and serve as specific recognition motifs for a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Many enzymes involved in GAG sulfation are altered in malignant cells. Changes in expression of CS 4-O-sulfotransferases are noted in both ovarian and breast cancers, whereas cancerous lung tissues display elevated 6-O-sulfated CS, when compared to nonmalignant tissue. Additionally, increased expression of 6-O-sulfotransferases in ovarian and colorectal cancers, and 3-O-sulfotransferases in breast and pancreatic cancers, have been reported.O-GlcNAc levels, regulated by the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT and the hexosaminidase OGA, are altered in many cancers. O-GlcNAcylation occurs outside of the secretory pathway and is prevalent on numerous cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins, as well as the intracellular domains of some transmembrane surface proteins. O-GlcNAc cycling serves as a nutrient sensor to regulate signaling, transcription, mitochondrial activity, and cytoskeletal functions. There is often cross-talk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, not only at the same or proximal sites on polypeptides, but also through the regulation of enzymes that control cycles of these modifications. O-GlcNAcylation can influence cancer cell metabolism because of alterations in the stability or activity of transcription factors and kinases. O-GlcNAcylation affects phosphofructokinase 1 activity and redirects glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. This metabolic switch can confer a growth advantage on cancer cells. Additionally, O-GlcNAcylation regulates glycolysis in cancer cells via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) transcription factor. Many oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, NF-κB/p65, PFK1, SNAIL, Rb, and p53, are O-GlcNAcylated.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified many alterations in expression of glycosylation genes that correlate with cancers. The mechanistic basis is known in some cases. For instance, the transcription of MGAT5 (Figure 47.1) is induced by v-src, H-ras, and v-fps and the transcription factor ets-1. ST6GAL1 is likewise up-regulated by oncogenic ras isoforms, as well as through gene amplification. The expression of FUT7, which generates SLex in leukocytes, is induced by the transcriptional activator protein Tax of HTLV-1, which causes leukemia. The consequent increase in SLex expression may underlie the strong tissue infiltrative capacity of adult T-cell leukemia cells, likely mediated by selectins. Under the hypoxic conditions found in advanced tumors, hypoxia-resistant cancer cells survive by up-regulating HIF-1α. HIF-1α induces transcription of several glycosylation genes, leading to altered tumor glycans, including enhanced SLex and SLea expression. Tumor hypoxia may also affect the incorporation of diet-derived nonhuman Neu5Gc in human tumor cells by up-regulating transcription of the lysosomal sialin Sia transporter. Down-regulation of glycosylation genes by DNA methylation or histone deacetylation/trimethylation may silence glycosylation genes that appear to suppress tumor progression in some types of cancers, like MGAT3 or ST6GAL1. Posttranscriptional regulation of glycosylation pathways through microRNAs is also involved in tumor progression.Cancer stem cells, or tumor-initiating cells, constitute a small subpopulation of cancer cells that has tumor-initiating capability. Several glycans that are specific markers for embryonic stem cells (stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 [SSEA-3], SSEA-3 with fucose [Globo H], and SSEA-4) are also expressed by cancer stem cells. SSEA-1, an embryonic stem cell marker in mice, is found in cancer stem cells in human gliomas. Thus the expression of these glycans appears to be associated with the “stemness” of cells. Other cancer stem cell markers include the glycoproteins, CD133 (prominin-1), CD24, and CD44, all of which are regulated by their glycosylation status. Among these receptors, the activation of CD44 by its ligand, hyaluronan, is particularly important for maintaining cancer stem cell features.Cancer stem cells are often investigated in the context of EMT. Cells that have undergone EMT are highly similar to cancer stem cells. EMT is a critical event in tumor progression that prepares cancer cells for metastasis. It is governed by several well-defined transcription factors such as SNAIL and ZEB. EMT induces the differential expression of a subset of glycosyltransferases. Cancer cells with a mesenchymal phenotype up-regulate ST6GAL1 and MGAT5, while down-regulating MGAT3. The corresponding changes in N-glycan branching and sialylation affect the stability and/or activity of many target molecules central to the process of EMT, such as cadherins and integrins. Other EMT-associated glycan modifications include the GD1 ganglioside, and decreased expression of Gg4 and GM2 glycolipids, along with increases in SLex and SLea. EMT is typified by alterations in cell adhesion and invasiveness; however, marked changes in cellular metabolism also occur, many of which are directed by O-GlcNAcylation. The addition of O-GlcNAc to E-cadherin, Snail, and other EMT-related proteins modulates protein stability or trafficking, leading ultimately to dysregulated expression of metabolic genes.Several glycan antigens are used for detecting and monitoring the growth status of tumors. A classical serological assay for CA19-9, which detects SLea, is used to monitor tumor burden, clinical response to therapy, and disease relapse in patients with gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Other serological biomarkers include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a highly glycosylated glycoprotein used in the early detection of recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer, and CA125, which recognizes MUC16 and is used in monitoring ovarian cancer. In addition, the core-fucosylated α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) can be a sensitive and specific circulating biomarker for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Truncated O-GalNAc glycans Tn, STn, and T (Figure 47.2) are good markers for the detection of cancer in tumor sections. Furthermore, the detection of specific glycoproteins bearing these truncated O-glycans, such as cancer-specific MUC16 glycoforms, enhances the specificity of diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. In addition, specific glycoproteins modified with truncated glycans, including Tn and STn, have been used as targets to generate glycopeptide-specific antibodies that have shown potential utility in clinical trials. Other important biomarkers include SLex-related glycans, which are used in lung and breast cancer to monitor residual disease after surgery. In recent years, there has been a major interest in glycomic profiling of serum and other body fluid glycoproteins, in addition to glycoproteins in extracellular vesicles. Classic findings of glycan-specific antibodies associated with cancer, such as the antibodies against the nonhuman Sia, Neu5Gc, are also being reinvestigated. Another potential advance lies in improving the specificity of known cancer biomarkers by defining glycoprotein glycoforms uniquely expressed by cancer cells (e.g., prostate-specific antigen).In tandem with their roles as biomarkers, glycans are important targets for cancer therapeutics. A monoclonal antibody against GD2 has been U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma, and other GD2-targeting antibodies, as well as CAR-T cells, are in clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma, glioma, melanoma, and other cancers. Vaccines against GD2 are also being explored. The Tn-bearing form of MUC1 is another promising target, with both therapeutic antibodies and CAR-T cells against Tn-MUC1 under active investigation. Additionally, several selectin inhibitors are showing efficacy in clinical trials, including E-selectin-targeting glycomimetic agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and acute myelogenous leukemia. Heparin has long been known to have potent antitumor effects, in part because of its ability to block P- and L-selectin binding to tumor and/or host ligands (Chapter 34). However, heparin therapy for cancer treatment can be limited by its anticoagulant properties, and thus low-molecular-weight heparins or heparinoids that lack such activity may be needed. Low-molecular-weight heparins may also inhibit tumor progression by blocking heparanase activity or by interfering with constitutive HS activities. Other heparanase inhibitors such as the sulfated phosphomannopentaose PI-88, which inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis, may work by blocking selectins or competitively inhibiting HS binding and function. Low-molecular-weight oligosaccharides of hyaluronan could also be useful therapeutically, because they inhibit the pro-oncogenic influences of constitutive polymeric hyaluronan, especially drug resistance and signaling events induced by hyaluronan–CD44 interaction. Disaccharides that can enter the cell and act as decoys to divert glycosylation pathways are also showing promise (Chapter 55).Recently, there has been growing interest in targeting glycan-dependent molecular interactions to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition. N-glycosylation is important for stabilization of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule, as well as recognition by PD-1. Thus, therapeutic interference with PD-L1 glycosylation could provide a mechanism for hindering the activation of PD-1 on immune cells. The sialoglycan–Siglec interaction represents another critical immune checkpoint, and function-blocking antibodies against select Siglecs have entered clinical trials. Additionally, methods are being developed to block or ablate tumor cell Sia ligands for Siglecs via administration of sialic acid mimetics or the targeted delivery of sialidases to tumor cell surfaces. Alternatively, Siglecs expressed by hematopoietic cancer cells (e.g., Siglec 2) can serve as recognition molecules for CAR-T cell immunotherapy or delivery of cytotoxic drugs. In general, the leveraging of glycans and glycan-binding proteins to modulate antitumor immunity holds much potential, given the well-known roles of these molecules in regulating the overall immune response.The authors appreciate contributions from Bryan Toole to the previous version and helpful comments and suggestions from Breeanna Urbanowicz, Melanie Simpson, and Koichi Furukawa to this update.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.48Richard D. Cummings, Marilyn Etzler, Michael G. Hahn, Alan Darvill, Kamil Godula, Robert J. Woods, and Lara K. Mahal.Antibodies, lectins, microbial adhesins, viral agglutinins, and other proteins with carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), collectively termed glycan-recognizing probes (GRPs), are widely used in glycan analysis because their specificities enable them to discriminate among a diverse variety of glycan structures. The native multivalency of many of these molecules promotes high-affinity avidity binding to the glycans and cell surfaces containing those glycans. This chapter describes the variety of commonly used GRPs, the types of analyses to which they may be applied, and cautionary principles that affect their optimal use.The first evidence that glycans were antigenic arose from the discovery of the human blood group ABO antigens (Chapter 14). A key tool in these studies were plant lectins that by the mid-1940s had found widespread use in typing blood. These lectins are relatively specific for blood types and they can be easily purified and are stable (Chapter 31). The discovery of the blood groups and the antibodies and lectins binding them indicated that such proteins could also be generally useful in identifying specific glycan sequences.Hundreds of different plant and animal lectins and other proteins with CBMs have now been characterized. Thus, although monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are often more specific for glycan determinants and bind with higher affinity, many plant and animal lectins and CBMs also have useful specificities for determinants beyond monosaccharides, have cloned sequences, are usually less expensive and commercially available, and have well-characterized binding specificities. GBPs are also found in many other organisms (Chapters 31, 36, and 37), and reagents from these organisms are currently in use in the field. The availability of GBPs and mAbs has helped to catapult the field of glycobiology into the modern era.Many of the lectins currently used as tools in glycobiology originate from plants, but some also come from animals (e.g., snails) or mushrooms. Most were characterized initially by hapten inhibition assays, in which monosaccharides, their derivatives, or small oligosaccharides block binding to cells or other glycan-coated targets. Such small-sized molecules that compete with binding of a lectin or antibody to a larger ligand are termed haptens. Lectins are often grouped by specificity depending on the monosaccharide(s) that can inhibit their binding at millimolar concentrations and their distinct preference for α- or β-anomers of the sugar. However, lectins within a particular specificity group may also differ in their affinities for different glycans. The binding affinity (Kd) of lectins for complex glycans is often in the range of 1–10 µm, but for monosaccharides the affinity may be in the millimolar range. For complex glycoconjugates with multiple determinants or multivalency, the binding avidity of lectins may approach nanomolar values. For example, concanavalin A (ConA) is an α-mannose/α-glucose-binding lectin that recognizes N-glycans and is not known to bind common O-glycans on animal cell glycoproteins. However, it binds oligomannose-type N-glycans with much higher affinity than complex-type biantennary N-glycans, and it does not recognize more highly branched complex-type N-glycans (Figure 48.1). Other lectins, such as L-phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA) and E-PHA from Phaseolus vulgaris, as well as lentil lectin (LCA) from Lens culinaris, also recognize specific determinants of N-glycans. Some animal lectins that are widely used include those from invertebrates, such as Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) from the snail. In fact, these lectins and others are frequently used to explore structural features of glycans on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and cells (Figures 48.2, 48.3, and 48.4 and Chapters 31 and 32). Our understanding of lectins and use of them as reagents has been improving because of the creation of recombinant lectins, including engineered varieties discussed below, and the increased definition of lectin specificity enabled by glycan microarrays and other techniques (Chapter 29).Examples of N-glycans recognized by concanavalin A (ConA) from Canavalia ensiformis and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA).

Several approaches to obtain these antibodies have been described.In addition, there is an emerging technology using phage display to identify single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of antibodies that can also bind to glycan antigens. However, in many cases, it is difficult to define the specific epitopes recognized by these antibodies because isolated glycans are often characterized by microheterogeneities and related glycan antigens for comparison are often unavailable. Recently developed approaches, such as glycan microarrays and related techniques, combined with advances in the chemical synthesis of glycans, are helping to better define the specificities of mAbs (Chapter 29).Examples of different mammalian glycan antigens recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies. The antigens have the structures shown within the boxed area and are named as indicated.

The antigens have the structures shown within the boxed area and are named as indicated. In some cases, the importance of the reducing terminal end (more...)Antiglycan antibodies are widely used in glycobiology, and some common mammalian antigens they recognize are shown in Figures 48.5 and 48.6. Many of the murine mAbs to glycan antigens are of the IgM isotype. However, if the animal is well-immunized and serum titers are high, IgGs are frequently generated (e.g., ∼35% of the plant-glycan-directed mAbs are IgG). The higher valency of IgM antibodies that form pentamers or hexamers can affect the binding specificity. Some antibodies to glycan antigens are commercially available, whereas others are obtainable only from individual laboratories or stock centers. Some antibodies against mammalian antigens are shown in Figures 48.5 and 48.6, and they recognize terminal glycan determinants, although subterminal sequences may also be required for binding and or in some cases may decrease binding. Many of the antibodies generated to date against plant glycans recognize internal structural features of these polysaccharides. Several antibodies against the plant cell wall homogalacturonans or xylans bind to internal backbone residues, frequently with varying sensitivities as to the level of backbone substitution by either glycan or nonglycan substituents. In some cases, the length of the unsubstituted backbone that is recognized by an antibody varies, thereby allowing the antibodies to be used to identify variations in backbone substitution density. In addition, the context of expression (free glycan vs. glycoprotein vs. glycolipid) or the class of glycan (N- vs. O-linked) may play a significant role in determining specificity and affinity. For example, antibodies to the 6-sulfo-SLex antigen require the fucose, sialic acid, and GlcNAc-6-O-sulfate residues. In contrast, the MECA-79 antibody recognizes extended core-1 O-glycans that contain internal GlcNAc-6-O-sulfate residues; it does not require either the fucose or sialic acid for recognition, but it does require the core-1 O-glycan. There are also many mAbs that recognize different glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans.With the growing understanding of the principles of glycan recognition (Chapter 29), there have been several novel glycan-detection reagents reported based on engineering mutant forms of endogenous lectins (engineered lectin) or carbohydrate-processing enzymes. Recombinant and engineered proteins can offer advantages over lectins or antibodies. They may be expressed, often in Escherichia coli, as opposed to being isolated from plant, fungal, or animal sources. Expression reduces batch variations that may result from isolation and offers a scalable solution to the demand for reagents. With protein engineering being based on the ever-increasing number of crystal structures of oligosaccharide-protein complexes, the structural origin of the specificity of an engineered protein may be well-understood. This stands in contrast to the case of antibodies that may be specific, but are rarely analyzed crystallographically, and thus the molecular origin of their specificity often remains unknown. For this reason, it is challenging to predict or interpret antibody specificity or cross-reactivity between glycans. In recent years, there has been increased interest in recombinant lectins derived from bacterial adhesins (e.g., “Siglec-like” binding regions [SLBRs] from Streptococcus mutans) and engineered lectins with altered specificities. Another avenue of new reagents has been the conversion of enzymes into reagents for detecting substrates. The concept was demonstrated more than 40 years ago, with anhydrotrypsin serving as an early example. In the specific case of glycan-binding reagents derived from inactivated glycosylhydrolases or other enzymes, the specificity is conferred by the endogenous enzyme, which is often well known. Inactivation—for example, by point mutation of the catalytic nucleophile—generally leads to a protein that retains the desired specificity and may still retain sufficient affinity to be useful as a detection reagent. As an example, an inactivated bacteriophage-derived endosialidase has been shown to have lectin-like properties and can be used as a probe in the specific detection of its substrate, polysialic acid. More often, however, the inactivated enzyme requires additional engineering to amplify its affinity and/or improve its selectivity/specificity for the glycan substrate of interest. Thus, the development of structure-based protein engineering promises a new avenue to generate glycan-detection reagents with complementary and sometimes preferable features to those offered by traditional lectins and antibodies.Some of the important uses of lectins, CBMs, and antibodies are illustrated in Figure 48.7. Antibodies, lectins, and CBMs each have distinct advantages. Lectins are usually less expensive than antibodies and are often naturally available in seeds and plant materials. The genes encoding many CBMs have been cloned, enabling facile heterologous expression to obtain needed quantities of the protein. However, antibodies, lectins, and CBMs are often needed to bind a wide variety of glycan determinants. For example, no plant lectins specific for the SLea or the Lex antigens have been identified, whereas mAbs to these antigens are available. Conversely, no mAbs have been identified that bind general determinants, such as α2-6-linked sialic acid and core fucose, whereas lectins have this discriminating ability (e.g., Sambucus nigra agglutinin [SNA] and L. culinaris [LcH], respectively). Of course, many GRPs recognize determinants independently of their presentation—that is, the same epitope may be presented on multiple types of glycans (e.g., O-glycans, N-glycans, or glycolipids). Although available antibodies thus far cannot distinguish common N-glycan structural motifs, such features are well-recognized by some plant lectins. For example, the plant lectin ConA does not bind mucin-type O-glycans in animal cells, but binds only to some specific classes of N-glycans (Figure 48.1). Additionally, E-PHA binds “bisected” complex-type N-glycans (Figure 48.2) and does not bind known glycolipids or O-glycans. Great care should be taken, however, to use lectins and antibodies at appropriate concentrations in which their specificity can be exploited.Examples of different uses of plant and animal lectins, carbohydrate-binding molecules (CBMs), and antibodies in glycobiology. Many plant and animal lectins are multivalent as shown, and antibodies are always multivalent, whereas CBMs are monovalent. (more...)The glycan determinants bound with highest affinity by each of these probes have been identified by a combination of approaches, including affinity chromatography, glycan synthesis, and binding to specific glycoconjugates, cells, and glycan microarrays. A good example of this is the L-PHA, which is often used by immunologists as a mitogen to stimulate quiescent T cells to divide. L-PHA originates from the red kidney bean Phaseolus vulgaris, which also contains isolectins to L-PHA—notably E-PHA. L-PHA binds to certain branched, complex-type N-glycans containing the pentasaccharide sequence Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2(Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6)Manα1-R (the so-called “2-6-branch”), as shown in the boxed portion of the glycan in Figure 48.2. Curiously, the only monosaccharide that effectively inhibits either L-PHA or E-PHA is GalNAc, although this monosaccharide is not part of the N-glycan determinants recognized by these lectins (Figure 48.2). The binding of L-PHA is used to identify specific types of branched N-glycans in cells. L-PHA binding is dramatically decreased in mice genetically null for the branching β1-6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT5 and -5B) (Chapter 9). The expression of L- or E-PHA-binding glycoproteins is increased in many tumor cells (Chapter 47). Similar studies show E-PHA binds bisected complex-type N-glycans containing the GlcNAcβ1-4Man-R in the core, and such structures are produced by MGAT3, and E-PHA-binding glycans are also elevated in some tumor cells.Thus, using a variety of lectins and antibodies, it is possible to deduce many aspects of glycan structures. Microarrays in which a variety of lectins and antibodies are printed on a slide can also give valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. This approach is especially sensitive in regard to defining whether biological samples differ in glycosylation. For example, such microarrays have been used to identify glycosylation differences in melanoma metastasis, leading to the identification of core fucose as a critical determinant of metastatic potential.There are several approaches to using antibodies and lectins in glycan purification, including affinity chromatography or affinity binding and immunoprecipitation or lectin-induced precipitation. The proteins may be covalently coupled to a carrier such as Sepharose or biotinylated and captured on streptavidin-Sepharose. In addition, antibodies may be noncovalently captured on protein A (or G)-Sepharose. These bound antibodies and lectins can then be used to isolate glycoconjugates expressing specific glycan determinants. ConA-Sepharose is commonly used to isolate glycoproteins as it shows little binding to nonglycosylated proteins. However, it does not bind all glycoproteins because it recognizes specific N-glycan structures. ConA-Sepharose has also been used to isolate free oligo- and polymannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary N-glycans.When combined in a serial format, multiple lectins can be used in affinity chromatography to isolate glycoconjugates containing most of the major glycan structures present in animal cells, with glycoconjugates being separated as classes that share common determinants. An example of serial lectin affinity chromatography is shown in Figure 48.8. Identification of glycoproteins through analysis of released glycopeptides gives important information on proteins carrying specific modifications. Release of glycans coupled with ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can yield highly pure glycans with predicted structures that can then be confirmed by mass spectrometry of native and permethylated derivatives (Chapters 50 and 51).An example of the use of different immobilized plant lectins in serial lectin affinity chromatography of complex mixtures of glycopeptides. In this example, a mixture of glycopeptides is applied to a column of immobilized concanavalin A (ConA), and the (more...)Mixed-bed lectin chromatography using a combination of different immobilized lectins is useful for simultaneously separating all types of glycoconjugates from nonglycosylated material (e.g., glycopeptides from peptides). Combinations of affinity chromatography and other chromatographic techniques can be very useful in identifying and separating glycopeptides. Thus, the ability of glycans to be recognized by lectins dependent on specific structural features in the glycans is a powerful tool for glycan identification and isolation. In some approaches, the glycans are tagged at the reducing end by fluorophores and radioisotopes or may be obtained by metabolic radiolabeling from cells or tissues grown in the presence of radiolabeled sugar precursors, such as [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine. Glycan fractionation shown on immobilized lectins in Figure 48.8 is currently not possible with antibodies because no antibodies are known that can distinguish such core structural features in glycans.When intact glycoproteins or complex polysaccharides (e.g., those found in plant cell walls [Chapter 24]) are analyzed for their interactions with plant lectins or antibodies, the interpretation of data may be complicated by the multivalency of the glycoprotein/polysaccharide and the density of the immobilized lectin/antibody. For example, glycoproteins containing multiple high-mannose-type N-glycans bind so tightly to immobilized ConA that it is difficult to elute the bound glycoprotein, even with extremely high concentrations of hapten and under harsh conditions. Lower densities of ConA conjugation reduce its avidity for the glycoproteins and promote hapten dissociation of bound ligands with lower concentrations of sugars. When used in combination, multiple lectins, such as ConA, AAL (Aleuria aurantia lectin), LCA, and RCA (Ricinus communis agglutinin), can be used to isolate most glycoproteins containing N-and O-glycans from animal cells. This is a potentially powerful approach for glycoproteomics, or the identification of glycoproteins and their glycosylation status.Another approach to enhance glycoproteomic analyses is to use multiple lectins in mixed-bed or multi-lectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC). In such an approach a number of different lectins are used that recognize different glycan features, such as those shown in earlier figures in this chapter. Glycoproteins (or glycopeptides) with these selected features can be isolated and enriched from complex mixtures, allowing for more focused analyses on the glycoconjugates of interest. In addition, in some types of analyses a genetic disruption can result in the collapse of classes of glycans to a single structure, allowing a lectin-enrichment strategy to be particularly useful in identifying the glycomic features of interest. For example, deletion of the gene Cosmc (C1GalT1C1) in cell lines leads to the collapse of GalNAc-type O-glycans, which can vary immensely in structure, to a single structure, the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). These derived cell lines are termed SimpleCells. If glycopeptides are prepared from such cells, all glycopeptides that contain an O-glycan with the Tn antigen can be affinity purified using immobilized Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA). The isolated glycopeptides can then be sequence-identified. In this type of approach the O-glycoproteome of cells regarding sites of O-GalNAc-type O-glycosylation can be more readily characterized, as there is no universal set of reagents that can generally recognize all the different types of O-glycans in normal cell-derived glycoproteins.Lectins and antibodies can also be used in western blotting approaches to characterize protein and lipid glycosylation, in which biotinylated lectin or antibody probes are applied to material transferred to nitrocellulose or other supports after electrophoresis or chromatography. The bound lectins/antibodies are visualized by binding streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and conversion of luminescent substrates. In these approaches, the concentrations of lectins and antibodies used must be low enough both to reduce false-positive, nonspecific binding and to allow for inhibition by appropriate haptens to confirm sugar binding. Removal of N-glycans by PNGaseF, or of sialic acid by neuraminidase, can eliminate binding to specific lectins and antibodies in western blotting, thus indicating the lectin/antibody-bound determinant.Mention should also be made about the approaches to isolate novel lectins from natural sources, or even when made recombinantly or in the form of some type of GRP. Historically, such isolation methods have used affinity chromatography. For example, a high density of lactose linked to agarose in the form of an affinity column can be used to isolate galectins, which can be eluted with lactose as a hapten. The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) was isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized yeast mannans containing phosphorylated mannose. There are also other forms of isolation, including salt precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and the capture of a tagged and recombinant chimeric-lectin by capture of the tag (e.g., His tag). A recent method exploits a “capture and release” approach, in which multivalent ligands recognized by a lectin are assembled, whereby they can capture the lectin of interest, and then filtration or centrifugation may be used to isolate the lectin complexed with ligand. The lectin can then be dissociated and is available for study. Any of these type of methods are also useful when combined with proteomic analyses in identifying novel lectins and protein complexes that bind to glycans.The classic approaches for using antibodies, CBMs, and lectins to characterize cell-surface glycoconjugates are histochemistry (lectins) and immunohistochemistry (antibodies), flow cytometry with cell sorting, and cell agglutination. In histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, tissues are prepared and fixed as usual for histological staining, and then incubated with appropriate biotinylated or peroxidase-labeled lectins or antibodies (glycolipids are extracted during standard paraffin embedding procedures and require frozen sections for sensitive detection). The bound lectins, CBMs, or antibodies are then visualized by means of secondary reagents, such as streptavidin-peroxidase or labeled secondary antibody. These approaches often yield information that is difficult to obtain by any other approach. For example, they can reveal the spatial orientation of different glycans, their relative abundance, and whether they are intracellular and/or extracellular. Three important controls in such studies are (1) use of lectins, CBMs, or antibodies at limiting concentrations to avoid nonspecific binding; (2) confirmation of the specificity of binding by appropriate inhibition by haptens or by destruction of the predicted target glycans with glycosidases; and (3) use of multiple lectins, CBMs, or antibodies to provide further confirmation of the conclusions.Lectins and antibodies to glycans have also been widely used in flow cytometry and cell sorting. In such studies, cells are incubated with low, nonagglutinating levels of lectins or antibodies that are biotinylated and conjugated to fluorescently labeled streptavidin or directly fluorescently labeled. Cells with bound lectins or antibodies can then be identified by their fluorescence in the flow cytometer, and the degree of fluorescence can be correlated with the number of binding sites. A key consideration in flow cytometry is to avoid high concentrations of lectins or antibodies that cause agglutination of cells. Lectins and antibodies can also be used to identify specific membrane localization of different glycans, using confocal microscopy and electron microscopy.Lectins and antibodies are useful for characterizing cell-surface glycans when limited numbers of cells are available. Studies on glycosylation of embryonic stem cells have been greatly aided by using panels of specific lectins to identify unique glycan determinants and changes in their expression during cellular differentiation. A recent variation of this approach is to use a microarray of immobilized lectins, which are probed with fluorescently labeled glycoproteins in extracts of cells. Such assays can reveal minor differences in protein glycosylation between different samples and give insight into the glycan structures that are present.One of the oldest uses of lectins is in the agglutination and precipitation of glycoconjugates, cells, and membrane vesicle preparations. The easiest assay for many soluble lectins that are multivalent is agglutination of target cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, or even bacteria or fungi. Agglutination can often be easily observed without a microscope, but it is also measurable in instruments such as aggregometers. In these assays, a lectin solution is serially diluted and the reciprocal of the final dilution that gives measurable cell agglutination is taken to define the activity. Bacterial agglutination by plant and animal lectins is often used to explore the surface glycocalyx and changes in glycocalyx on culture conditions and to define phenotypes of different strains or serotypes. Lectin precipitation and aggregation can be used to define the glycan composition and overall architecture of polysaccharides, as has been done for bacterial, algal, plant, and animal polysaccharides.Combining many different GRP, including lectins and antibodies, into a lectin microarray is another way in which the glycome of cells may be explored. Such arrays have dozens of specific proteins immobilized in a microarray format and can provide valuable information about the glycosylation status of cells and glycoconjugates. Fluorescent-tagged glycoproteins from a source (e.g., cell or tissue extracts) can be applied to these arrays and the binding pattern compared to a control sample can reveal features of the glycome of the material, such as patterns of sialylation, fucosylation, and even linkages of residues with glycans using linkage-specific reagents. The advantages of this approach is the microscale in which it can be performed, the relatively high-throughput nature of the technology, and the precision of discrimination in terms of differential glycosylation between two samples. The system is particularly adaptable to include new reagents as they become available (e.g., new lectins or engineered proteins).An important use of lectins and antibodies has been in the selection of cell lines (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] cells) that express altered cell-surface glycans. The common lectins that have been used are ConA, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin), L-PHA, LCA, PSA (Pisum sativum agglutinin), E-PHA, ricin, modeccin, and abrin. The latter three lectins are heterodimeric, disulfide-bonded proteins that are classified as type-II ribosome-inactivating proteins; they contain an A subunit that constitutes an enzyme called RNA-N-glycosidase, which inactivates the 28S ribosome, and a B subunit that is a galactose-binding lectin (Chapter 31). Other plant lectins such as ConA, WGA, or LCA (which lack an enzymatic or toxic A subunit) are still toxic to animal cells via poorly understood mechanisms, whereas yet others, such as soybean agglutinin (SBA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), are not highly toxic to animal cells in culture. One mechanism of toxicity of plant lectins is the induction of apoptosis, perhaps by blocking receptor or nutrient transport functions in cells, or by cross-linking apoptotic receptors. Noncytotoxic lectins and antibodies to specific glycans can be rendered toxic by conjugation to ricin A subunit or other toxic proteins. Using such agents, both loss-of-function (e.g., loss of a glycosyl-transferase or glycosidase) and gain-of-function (e.g., activation of a latent transferase gene) mutants have been obtained. More details about glycosylation mutants of cultured cells are presented in Chapter 49.The specificity of lectins and antibodies to particular glycans has made them especially useful in cloning genes encoding glycosyltransferases or other proteins required for proper glycosylation, such as nucleotide sugar transporters. For example, CHO cells and the African green monkey kidney cell line COS lack glycans with terminal α-galactose residues. Consequently, the cells do not bind the plant lectin GSI-B4 (Figure 48.3). When transfected with a cDNA library prepared from cells that do express terminal α-galactose residues (such as murine teratocarcinoma cells F9), cells that have taken up a plasmid encoding the cognate α1-3 galactosyltransferase and express terminal α-residues bind to GSI-B4 and can be identified with plates coated with the lectin. Isolation of plasmids from the bound cells and repeated recloning and reexpression by this technique (called expression cloning) led to the identification of a specific gene encoding the murine α1-3 galactosyltransferase (Ggta1). Similar approaches using an antibody to the Lewis x antigen (SSEA-1) led to cloning of the Lewis blood group Fuct-III.Related approaches using antibodies and lectins to other glycan structures and wild-type CHO cells and CHO mutants led to the identification of the genes encoding many other glycosyltransferases, including some involved in extending glycosphingolipids and nucleotide sugar transporters, such as the transporter for CMP-NeuAc. Such approaches based on lectin selection are also useful with yeast. For example, the gene encoding a yeast N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAcT) was identified by expression cloning using a GlcNAcT-deficient yeast. The mannan chains of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis normally contain some terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues that are bound by the plant lectin GSL-II, which binds terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues (Figure 48.4). A mutant lacking the GlcNAcT and lacking terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues on mannoproteins was identified. Transformation of yeast with DNA containing the gene encoding the GlcNAcT led to yeast clones that were bound by the fluorescently labeled GSL-II. This strategy was used to identify the gene encoding the GlcNAcT. The transporters for UDP-Gal in Leishmania parasites and in the plant Arabidopsis were also identified by expression cloning in Lec8 CHO cells; these cells have a mutation in their endogenous UDP-Gal transporter, and consequently lack galactose-containing glycans on their surface. For the UDP-Gal transporter from Arabidopsis, Lec8 cells were cotransfected with a cDNA library encoding the putative Arabidopsis UDP-Gal transporter, along with a glucuronosyltransferase that can lead to synthesis of the unsulfated version of the HNK epitope (Figure 48.6), GlcAβ1-3Galβ-R that is bound by a specific antibody. This identification strategy led to the expression cloning of several UDP-Gal transporters from Arabidopsis.CHO and COS cell lines have also been useful in characterizing the activities of novel glycosyltransferase genes that were identified by other approaches. For example, candidate fucosyltransferase genes encoding α1-2 or α1-3 fucosyltransferases have been expressed in CHO and COS cells, which lack these enzymes. Expression of these enzymes then leads to surface expression of antigens recognized by specific antibodies and lectins, such as the H-antigen (for the α1-2 FucT) or Lex and SLex (for the α1-3 FucT).Lectins and antibodies to glycan antigens have been useful in assaying specific glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in various formats (Figure 48.7). Immobilized lectins have been used to isolate products of glycosyltransferase assays, such as chitin polysaccharides on WGA or glycosylated peptides on mixed-bed lectin columns. α1-3 Fucosyltransferases that synthesize the Lex and SLex antigens have been assayed based on capture of the product on immobilized antibodies to these antigens or binding of antibody to the immobilized fucosylated product in an ELISA-type format, or in flow cytometry using beads containing the acceptor glycan that is modified by an enzyme to a new structure recognized by an antibody or lectin. Likewise, α2-3 sialyltransferases and α2-6 sialyltransferases have been assayed using immobilized acceptors in an ELISA-type format and in BIAcore formats (Chapter 29), and their products have been measured with MAL (which binds to the α2-3-sialylated product) or SNA (which binds to the α2-6-sialylated product). Similarly, α1-3 galactosyltransferases have been assayed using immobilized acceptors in an ELISA-type format, and the product has been measured with GSI-B4 or Viscum album agglutinin, which binds to the α1-3 galactosylated product. The glycoprotein-specific β1-4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase has been assayed using glycoprotein acceptors in solution, capture by a specific mAb in a microtiter plate, and measurement of product by an ELISA-type assay with a Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) that binds to terminal β1-4-linked GalNAc residues generated by the enzyme. Conversely, glycosidases can be assayed by measuring the gain or loss in binding of lectins or antibodies. For example, the lectin PNA, which binds to nonsialylated Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr in O-glycans, can be used to measure bacterial sialidases by agglutination of treated erythrocytes. Many microbial hydrolases have evolved to attack their substrates in structurally complex contexts (e.g., plant cell walls [Chapter 24]). The number and diversity of glycan-directed probes now allows the detailed characterization of such enzymes acting on biologically relevant structures, yielding new insights into their activities. It is easy to envision other ways in which lectins, CBMs, and antibodies can be used to probe the products of specific glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, given the specificities of the glycan-directed probes described here.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.49Jeffrey D. Esko, Hans H. Wandall, and Pamela Stanley.Rapid progress in understanding glycosylation pathways of eukaryotes came with the application of genetic strategies to isolate mutants of mammalian cells and yeast with alterations in glycan synthesis. This chapter reviews methods used to isolate mammalian cell glycosylation mutants and the diversity of mutants that may be obtained from selections and screens. The applications of glycosylation mutants to address functional roles of glycans and in glycosylation engineering are discussed briefly. Many of the cell lines described in this chapter are available through the American Type Culture Collection.The success of bacterial and yeast genetics in isolating mutants and using them to define biochemical pathways led in the late 1960s to the development of somatic cell genetics using mammalian cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were selected by two independent groups for initial experiments to isolate stable mutants. Somatic cell genetic strategies were applied early to glycobiology, yielding numerous mutants in glycoprotein biosynthesis and later in proteoglycan, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and glycolipid biosynthesis. The ability to isolate glycosylation mutants in mammalian cells made it possible to unravel pathways of glycan synthesis and degradation and to identify, isolate, and map structural and regulatory genes. CHO cells thus became a focus for experiments to decipher glycosylation pathways and, importantly, provided mutant host cells for the production of viruses and glycoproteins with modified glycans. This proved to be extremely beneficial to the biotechnology industry because most recombinant therapeutics are glycoproteins. CHO cells and CHO glycosylation mutants are now the workhorse of the biotechnology industry. They are particularly useful because they produce only minor, if any, quantities of nonhuman glycans or glycan modifications that give rise to undesirable antibodies. Conserved glycosylation pathways in yeast were delineated by similar approaches (Chapter 23).Mutants in any cell type often accumulate the precursor immediately upstream of the block in a pathway and thereby reveal the structure of their substrate(s). Sequencing of mutant alleles reveals specific mutations that may give rise to a glycosylation phenotype. In most cases, mutations are loss-of-function and they reduce or abrogate the activity of an enzyme in a pathway; but there are also gain-of-function mutations that activate a silent glycosylation gene, elevate the expression of an existing activity, or inactivate a negative regulatory factor (Figure 49.1). In nearly all cases, glycosylation mutations lead to the presence of altered glycans on cell-surface glycoconjugates and changes in cell properties that link glycan structure to function. Although gene editing techniques using CRISPR/Cas9 or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are now the method of choice for introducing a mutation that weakens or ablates a glycosylation gene (Chapters 27 and 56), initially such approaches did not allow for the serendipitous findings that often emerge from genetic screens. Subsequently, genetic screens were performed using HAP1 (haploid) human cells mutagenized by retroviral gene trap. Such unbiased screens led to the identification of multiple, previously unknown, glycosylation genes. Lately, however, the evolvement of CRISPR tools and the generation of genome-wide libraries have made it possible to conduct both loss-of-function and gain-of-function screens in nonhaploid cell lines, providing an unbiased strategy to discover new genes that influence cellular glycosylation (Figure 49.2).Alteration of cell-surface glycans by recessive and dominant glycosylation mutations. Selections for glycosylation mutants. Cytotoxic lectins or agents that bind to specific sugar residues select for resistant cells (left). Screen for mutants using replica plating. Colonies on plastic are transferred to discs and screened for defects in (more...)Cells in culture mutate at a low rate (<10−6 mutations per locus per generation). In CHO cells, some loci are functionally haploid (single copy), and in HAP1 human cells, essentially all loci are haploid, which means that a single hit may generate a recessive mutant. However, typical mammalian cells are diploid and immortalized cells are often hyperploid, so the frequency of finding recessive mutants is low. To greatly increase the probability of finding desirable mutants, mutations may be induced by treating cells with chemical (e.g., alkylating agents), physical (e.g., ionizing radiation), or biological (e.g., a virus) mutagens or, perhaps more likely, by lentiviral transduction with CRIPSR/Cas9 genome-wide or focused libraries. Regardless of the method used to induce mutations, selection or enrichment is usually needed to find rare recessive or dominant mutants bearing a desired glycosylation phenotype (Figure 49.1). For example, direct selection for resistance to cytotoxic plant lectins (Chapters 31 and 32) that bind to cell-surface glycans gives a range of glycosylation mutants. Importantly, many mutants resistant to one or more lectins because of the loss of specific sugars become supersensitive to a different group of lectins that recognize sugar residues exposed by the mutation (Figure 49.2). The latter may be used to select for revertants in the original mutant population. Nontoxic lectins are also useful for enriching lectin-binding mutants (e.g., by flow cytometry). Mutations that affect all stages of glycosylation reactions, including the generation and transport of nucleotide sugars, have been identified using lectins as selective agents.In principle, any glycan-binding protein (GBP), antibody, or other agent that recognizes cell-surface glycans or a glycoprotein can be used to isolate mutants with a glycosylation defect (Figure 49.2). Conjugation of a GBP or protein domain to a toxin that cannot enter the cell independently, but can kill the cell following entry, can be used to select mutants when cytotoxic lectins are not available. For example, basic fibroblast growth factor FGF2-saporin complexes have been used for the selection of mutants deficient in heparan sulfate (HS). Lectins, antibodies, or ligands that are fluorescently tagged may be used to enrich for mutants that are either deficient in binding or have acquired a novel binding ability because of altered glycosylation or reduced expression of an antigen at the cell surface. Panning or immunodepletion are related techniques. For example, coating a plate with FGF2 allows selection of mutant cells that fail to produce HS proteoglycans and consequently fail to adhere to a FGF2-coated plate. HAP1 cells that fail to glycosylate α-dystroglycan fail to bind a specific monoclonal antibody and may be enriched by immunodepletion (Figure 49.2). Radiation suicide is another direct selection method for obtaining glycosylation mutants. Incubation of cells with a radioactive sugar, sulfate, or other precursor of high radioactivity leads to labeled glycoproteins, glycolipids, or proteoglycans. After prolonged storage of the cells, radiation damage kills wild-type cells, whereas mutants with reduced incorporation of the label survive. Animal cells can also be replica-plated, much like microbial colonies, using porous cloth made of polyester or nylon as the replica (Figure 49.2). Colonies of cells on the disc can be used to identify mutants with reduced incorporation of radioactive precursors or to identify mutants that fail to bind to a lectin, an antibody, or a growth factor. An adaptation of this technique allows detection of mutants affecting a specific enzyme by direct assay for activity in colony lysates generated on a disc. Although this technique has great specificity, its limited capacity makes detection of rare mutants difficult, and mutagenesis before screening is usually a requirement.The resulting strains must be cloned and carefully characterized for stability and the biochemical and molecular basis of mutation. Additional genetic analyses include somatic cell hybridization for dominance/recessive testing and assigning mutants to different genetic complementation groups. Specifically, when mutations are introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), the affected genes can be identified through deep sequencing analysis of enriched sgRNA populations. Regardless of the technique used to isolate mutants, biochemical analysis involves the characterization of glycan structures produced by mutant cells (Chapter 50), the quantitation and analysis of intermediates, and assays for activities thought to be missing or acquired based on the properties of the mutant. Identifying the molecular basis of mutation requires isolation of a complementing cDNA that reverts the mutant phenotype and determining whether the mutation arose from defective transcription, translation, or stability of the gene product or from a missense or nonsense mutation in the coding region of the gene. Targeted gene mutation (Chapter 56) can also be used to validate a phenotype after a gene has been identified in a selected mutant.Transgenic mice that overexpress a glycosylation gene, or mutant mice that lack a glycosylation activity because of targeted gene inactivation (Chapters 27 and 56), are a source of mutant cells that may be used for glycobiology research. Fibroblasts or lymphoblasts can be obtained readily from humans with a disorder of glycosylation (Chapter 45). Cells may be grown as primary cultures or immortalized by viral transformation. By crossing mutant mice with the Immortomouse, which carries a temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen in every cell, immortalized mutant cell lines can be derived from essentially any cell type. For mutations that cause embryos to die during gestation, mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells can be derived from blastocysts, provided the mutation does not result in cell-autonomous lethality. The resulting mutant ES cell lines can be used to investigate functions for specific glycans during differentiation in embryoid cell culture, or in vivo in mouse chimeras. A chimera is obtained by injecting wild-type or mutant ES cells into the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst. If the ES cells survive, the resulting mouse is a mixture of cells derived from the ES cells and cells derived from the blastocyst and is termed a chimera. Mutant ES cells may not contribute equally well to all tissues. For example, ES cells lacking MGAT1 are unable to make complex or hybrid N-glycans (Chapter 9), but they differentiate normally into many cell types in cultured embryoid bodies. However, following introduction into blastocysts, ES cells lacking MGAT1 do not contribute to the organized layer of bronchial epithelium in chimeric embryos.Immortalized fibroblasts from patients with defects in glycosylation can be used to study the underlying defect (Chapter 45). Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts from patients with glycosylation disorders provide another approach for obtaining various differentiated cell lines for further study. The use of precise genetic engineering tools allows the correction of a genetic mutation in patient-derived fibroblasts, thereby creating pairs of isogenic cell lines for comparative studies. Alternatively, such isogenic pairs can be generated by introducing the patient-specific mutation in a cell or cell line of choice (Chapter 56).Selection schemes based on isolating rare mutants resistant to cytotoxic plant lectins have yielded a large number of glycosylation mutants affected in diverse aspects of glycan synthesis (Table 49.1). Some mutations affect several types of glycans, such as mutants with reduced nucleotide sugar formation or transport into the Golgi. For example, the UDP-Gal transporter defect in Lec8 mutant cells affects transfer of galactose to O- and N-glycans on glycoproteins, as well as to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and glycolipids. The ldlD mutant is particularly interesting in this regard, because it lacks the epimerase responsible for converting UDP-Glc to UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc (Figure 49.3). Because there are salvage pathways for importing Gal and GalNAc into cells (Chapter 5), the composition of different classes of glycans can be controlled in ldlD cells by nutritional supplementation with either of these two sugars. Mutations in glycosyltransferase genes may ablate activity or affect the kinetic properties of an enzyme (e.g., Lec1A; Table 49.1), or its subcellular localization (e.g., Lec4A; Table 49.1). Sequencing mutant alleles provides leads for further site-directed mutagenesis of the gene in order to define important functional domains of the protein required for catalysis or compartmentalization.Mutation of UDP-Glc/UDP-GlcNAc-4-epimerase, also called UDP-Gal-4-epimerase or GALE, in ldlD mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells prevents the generation of UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc preventing addition of Gal and GalNAc to all glycans. Salvage reactions (more...)Examples of recessive glycosylation mutants Some lectin-resistant mutants are defective in the formation of dolichol-P-oligosaccharides or in the processing reactions that remove Glc or Man after transfer of the glycan chain to a glycoprotein (Chapter 9). The latter mutants revealed the identity and importance of α-mannosidases in the formation of N-glycans. However, when the α-mannosidase II gene Man2a1 was ablated in mice, no effect was seen in certain tissues because another previously unknown α-mannosidase gene (Man2a2) allowed N-glycans to be synthesized. This finding emphasizes a limitation of somatic cells in that they may not express glycosylation genes that are developmentally regulated in a tissue-specific manner, thereby precluding the isolation of mutants affected in those genes from that cell line.The recessive mutants in Table 49.1 lack a glycosylation activity or fail to make a precursor. Dominant mutations that activate a silent gene reveal activities that may normally be expressed only in a few, very specialized cells in the body. Therefore, dominant mutants are important in glycosylation gene discovery, for identifying mechanisms of glycosylation gene regulation, and for defining pathways of glycan biosynthesis. The mutants in Table 49.2 show a gain-of-function, dominant, lectin-resistant phenotype caused by the increased expression of a glycosyltransferase that is normally silent or expressed at very low levels. The activation of a glycosyltransferase gene may reflect a mutation in a regulatory region of the gene or in a trans-acting factor. The genetic bases of the mutants in Table 49.2 are not known, but their characterization may reveal novel genes or regulatory factors that may not have been previously known to exist.Examples of dominant mutants expressing a new activity Glycosylation defects in GPI-anchor biosynthesis reduce expression of GPI-anchored proteins at the cell surface (Chapter 12). Originally, many GPI-anchor mutants were isolated by strategies that took advantage of antibodies to a GPI-anchored glycoprotein. For example, lymphoma cells expressing Thy-1 on their surface were incubated with an antibody to Thy-1 and serum-containing complement, which lysed cells expressing the Thy-1 antigen. Loss of GPI-anchor biosynthesis reduced the expression of Thy-1 on the surface and conferred resistance to the cytolytic effect. Other mutants have been obtained by sorting cells that do not bind to a fluorescent antibody or with bacterial toxins that bind GPI glycans. The GPI-anchor mutants obtained to date fall into many genetic complementation groups, each having a different lesion in GPI-anchor biosynthesis (Chapter 12). These mutants reveal the complexity of GPI-anchor biosynthesis: Multiple gene products are involved in forming the N-acetylglucosamine linkage to phosphatidylinositol, the first committed intermediate in the pathway; dolichol-P-Man is used as the donor of Man; at least three enzymes are involved in the attachment of ethanolamine phosphate residues; and five genes are required for the transfer of the GPI anchor to protein. The available strains show the importance of genetic approaches for identifying genes that might not be obvious from measuring biosynthetic reactions in vitro.A large collection of mutants defective in GAG/proteoglycan biosynthesis has been isolated (Table 49.3). Many of these mutants were obtained by replica-plating methods using sulfate incorporation to monitor GAG production in colonies (Figure 49.2). Mutants in the early steps of GAG biosynthesis (complementation groups A, B, and G) lack both CS and HS chains, and enzymatic assays showed that they lack enzymes responsible for the assembly of the core protein linkage tetrasaccharide shared by both these types of GAGs (Chapter 17). Another class of mutants (group D) is defective only in HS biosynthesis. This mutation defines a bifunctional enzyme (EXT1) that catalyzes the alternating addition of GlcNAc and glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues to growing HS chains. Some of the mutant alleles depress both enzyme activities, whereas others only affect the GlcA transfer activity. Thus, the mutants define different functional domains of the protein, which have been mapped by sequencing various mutant alleles. Mutants in another bifunctional enzyme, N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST1), have only a partial deficiency in N-sulfation of HS chains. Further analysis of the mutant showed that more than one isozyme is present in CHO cells and that the defect affects only one locus. Thus, the mutants revealed early on that the assembly of HS is much more complex than had been appreciated on the basis of known structures, enzyme reactions measured in cell extracts, or intermediates observed in pulse-labeling experiments. The many CHO mutants have recently been complemented with several gene-edited cell libraries that produce and display distinct GAGs with a broad repertoire of modifications.Examples of mutants defective in proteoglycan assembly Glycolipids and glycans linked by O-GalNAc are often relatively simple in cultured cells. For example, CHO cells synthesize mainly gangliosides GM3 and lactosylceramide with a small amount of glucosylceramide. O-GalNAc glycans contain up to only four sugars in glycoproteins from CHO cells. O-Fuc, O-Glc, and O-Man glycans are expressed on only a small subset of glycoproteins and are generally not detected by glycomic profiling methods (Chapter 50). All of these glycans are affected in the mutants described in Table 49.1 in which CMP-Neu5Ac, UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, or GDP-Fuc are reduced in the Golgi. Similarly, a defective sialyltransferase or galactosyltransferase may cause these glycans to be truncated. A mutant of B16 melanoma cells that is defective in ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase) lacks all glycolipids because this enzyme catalyzes the first step in the synthetic pathway (Chapter 11). However, cultured cell mutants defective in polypeptide O-GalNAc transferases (GALNTs) or protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) have not been isolated. This may reflect the paucity of cytotoxic lectins or toxins that bind to O-glycans and glycolipids or, in some cases, due to redundancy of enzymes (Chapters 10 and 11). However, cell mutants defective in most of the GALNTs, POFUT1, POGLUT1, and the various O-mannosyl transferases, including POMT1/2 and TMTC1-3, are now made available through precise genetic engineering. The same is the case with mutants in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids. In addition, mice lacking specific glycolipid biosynthetic enzymes and glycosyltransferases that transfer GlcNAc or Fuc to protein have been generated and provide a source of mutant cells that may be studied in culture. Interestingly, cells lacking the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) that acts in the cytoplasm to transfer GlcNAc to protein have not been obtained, and mouse mutants defective in this transferase become arrested in development at the two-cell-stage embryo, showing that this O-GlcNAc addition is essential for cell viability.Fortunately, the vast majority of glycosylation mutations allow single-cell viability in vitro under ideal culture conditions. Glycosylation mutants of mammalian cells have thus been used to address many questions in glycobiology and for glycosylation engineering of recombinant glycoproteins (Chapter 56). Because mutant selections are broad and often not intentionally biased, they generate mutants defective in both known and novel reactions. Thus, glycosylation mutants play an important role in research to define the pathways and regulation of glycosylation in mammals. In this regard, they are more useful tools than mutant mice because cells in culture are viable in the absence of glycolipids, GPI anchors, proteoglycans, O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc, O-Man glycans, and complex or hybrid N-glycans. Glycosylation mutants make truncated or altered glycans and thus provide an opportunity to study functional roles for cell-surface glycans in the context of a living cell. Important insights have been gained into specific sugars required for viral, bacterial, or parasite adhesion and infection, and for leukocyte cell adhesion and motility. In addition, functional roles for glycans in the intracellular sorting and secretion of glycoproteins, in growth factor binding and activation, and in receptor functions have been identified using glycosylation mutants. For example, a panel of CHO glycosylation mutants was used in a coculture assay to show that ligand-induced Notch signaling is reduced when GDP-Fuc levels are low, but is unaffected by reductions in Sia. Similarly, one of the first demonstrations for coreceptor functions for HS used mutant CHO cells defective in HS synthesis and engineered to express the FGF receptor. Most recently, genome-wide gene editing is being combined with screens for an altered phenotype to identify genes that contribute to that particular phenotype. For example, genes that facilitate infection by SARS-CoV-2 were uncovered in a genome-wide genetic screen.Although glycosylation is in many cases dispensable for survival of isolated cells in a culture dish, it is often crucial in vivo. Gene ablation studies in mice have identified numerous cases in which an intact glycosylation pathway is essential for embryogenesis. Examples include mutants that lack complex and hybrid N-glycans and proteoglycan mutants defective in HS, whereas the corresponding mutants in CHO cells do not cause an obvious growth phenotype. To address the role of glycans in more complex functions, introduction of mutations in stem cells compatible with creation of organoid or even organotypic 3D tissue cultures is used. For example, a human 3D organotypic skin model was used to address the contributions of various glycans on distinct types of glycoconjugates (glycolipids, N-glycans, O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc) by targeting of core extension steps. These studies demonstrated distinct tissue phenotypes for each of the mutant lines grown in 3D cultures, whereas no obvious growth phenotype was observed in conventional 2D cultures. Thus, glycosylation is often critical in the context of a multicellular organism but dispensable in isolated cells. This conclusion has been driven home by gene ablation studies in mice and further evidenced by the discovery of human genetic diseases which arise from mutations in genes involved in glycosylation (Chapter 45).CHO cells have become the cells of choice for the biotechnology industry in the production of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins and in glycosylation engineering (see Chapter 56). For example, CHO cells lacking FUT8, which adds fucose to the core GlcNAc of complex N-glycans, are used to produce cytotoxic therapeutic antibodies that have a greatly enhanced ability to kill their target cells. In another example, CHO cells with multiple mutations that simplify N- and O-glycans are being used by X-ray crystallographers to produce homogeneous preparations of membrane glycoproteins with highly truncated N- and O-glycans, greatly facilitating their crystallization.Somatic cell genetics arose from the desire to manipulate the genome of cultured cells in vitro. Today, the availability of genomic sequences from multiple organisms has shifted the emphasis in genetics toward the generation of mutant organisms using the techniques of transgenesis, homologous recombination for gene replacement, conditional gene inactivation, and precise gene editing. However, the study of somatic cell mutants still plays an important role in glycobiology research because it provides a less-expensive and faster method for studying the effects of deleting or expressing particular glycosylation gene products in a cell. Gain-of-function mutants may of course be generated by transfection of cDNAs encoding glycosylation genes, and reduced expression of any gene can be achieved by the use of RNA interference (RNAi), antisense cDNA strategies, or genome-wide gene editing screens. The combination of genome-wide screening and specific agents to select for glycan changes make it possible to discover new genes by screening for phenotypic changes directly related to glycosylation changes. Additionally, cells and mutants with well-characterized glycosylation pathways are ideal hosts for investigating the activity encoded by a putative glycosylation gene identified in genome sequence databases. These mutant cells also provide a platform to test the severity of human mutations in a complementation test: The normal human gene rescues defective glycosylation when transfected into the mutant cell, but the same gene with a pathological mutation does not. Thus, somatic cell mutants provide access to novel genes involved in glycosylation, which in turn guide strategies for sophisticated gene-manipulation experiments in animals. By combining the two approaches, the biological function of a particular glycosyltransferase, sugar residue, or lectin can be defined. Coupled with powerful mass spectrometry techniques for determining glycan structures (Chapter 50) from small samples of tissue or cells, glycosylation mutants of cells and animals provide complementary material for structure/function analyses and identifying mechanistic bases of glycan functions in mammals.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Carolyn R.

Prestegard.This chapter surveys techniques for structural characterization of glycans, including composition, linkage, and attachment to aglycones. It covers detection of specific glycan sequences on glycoproteins and cellular surfaces and methods for characterizing structures in three dimensions. The techniques described range from classical chemical detection and characterization of isolated glycan products to sensitive fluorescence methods used in combination with glycan-binding proteins and microscopy on cells and tissues. In addition, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), approaches that allow more detailed structural characterization, are discussed.The primary structure of a glycan is defined by the type and order of monosaccharide residues, by the configuration and position of glycosidic linkages, and by the nature and location of the nonglycan entity to which it is attached (the aglycone); see Chapters 2 and 3. For glycoproteins, different glycans can be attached to different sites in the protein, and these glycans can vary when that glycoprotein is made in different cell types or at different stages of development. Moreover, it is often three-dimensional (3D) features, or particular surface distributions of glycans, that are recognized by glycan-binding proteins. Characterization of these diverse structural features requires an array of different methods, with the choice of methodology depending very much on the problem.For a typical mammalian glycoprotein, the aim is often to identify the correct glycan structure from a range of known or predictable candidate structures, and a limited amount of structural data may suffice (Chapter 51). For glycans from bacteria or less well-characterized organisms, it is hard to make predictions, and therefore, a more complete data set may be required. The choice of methodology also depends on the amount and purity of material available, as well as the context in which data must be collected (e.g., tissue vs. isolated glycoprotein). If quantities are not limiting, the complete primary structure and even the tertiary (3D) structure may be determined. The need to respond to diverse circumstances and to understand the complexities of glycan structure has driven the development of many of the methods described in the following sections. The level of glycan structural characterization required to address the specific biological question that is being investigated can also direct experimental approaches.Methods for glycan detection in glycoconjugates include direct chemical reactions with the constituent monosaccharides, metabolic labeling with either radioactive or chemically reactive monosaccharides, and detection with specific glycan-recognizing proteins (including lectins and antibodies) (Chapter 48). A general method for detecting the presence of glycans on proteins involves periodate oxidation of their hydroxyl groups followed by Schiff base formation with amine- or hydrazide-based probes (Chapter 2). This chemical modification, also known as the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction, can identify glycoproteins in gels. Commercially available kits allow detection of 5–10 ng of glycoprotein, using the periodate reaction with subsequent amplification by means of biotin-hydrazide/streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase or fluorescence-based detection. Lectin overlay of a blot of a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel can detect the presence of specific glycans with comparable sensitivity and greater specificity. For example, the agglutinin from Sambucus nigra (SNA) binds to glycans that terminate with α2-6 sialic acid (Sia). Lectins (Chapters 31–36) recognizing terminal fucose (Fuc), galactose (Gal), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) are also commercially available.Metabolic labeling of glycoconjugates with radioactive sugars is another powerful tool for determining the composition of glycans. Cells incubated in media containing 3H- or 14C-labeled monosaccharides will incorporate the label into the glycans of glycoconjugates. Radiolabeled glycans can be detected following gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) by autoradiography or fluorography. They can also be released and studied in detail by various methods. The use of fluorescent probes and labels has enabled a reduction in the use of radioisotopes in applications in which the detection and quantitative determination of glycans, as opposed to glycosylation pathway information, is the primary objective. Fluorescent labels for sensitive detection of glycans after liquid chromatography (LC) include readily available 2-amino benzoic acid (2-AA) and 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB), which may be attached by reductive amination to the reducing sugar exposed on release of glycans from an aglycone.Metabolic labeling can also be performed with synthetic monosaccharides that are modified with chemically reactive groups. For example, the azido monosaccharide N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz) is converted by cells to N-azidoacetyl Sia (SiaNAz), which is incorporated into sialylated glycans in place of a natural Sia. The azido group can then be selectively reacted with phosphine or alkyne reagents (Chapter 53) that introduce a fluorescent dye or an affinity probe such as biotin, thereby enabling detection of Sia in cells. Azido analogs of GalNAc and GlcNAc can be used to label O-GalNAc (Chapter 10) or O-GlcNAc glycans (Chapters 13 and 19), respectively. Use of fluorescent labels can also be coupled with confocal microscopy to give important insights into the location of glycans in cells and tissues. However, such chemical modifications may change the biosynthesis and/or biology of glycans, creating some uncertainty about the observed results, and no method has completely supplanted radioactive metabolic labeling for pulse-chase studies of naturally occurring glycans.A glycosylated protein typically presents one or more diffuse bands during gel electrophoresis, resulting from heterogeneity of the attached glycans. Even when visualized by protein staining reagents, this phenomenon is often the first indication of the presence of glycans. Some high-molecular-weight glycoconjugates, such as mucins and proteoglycans, do not enter ordinary gels or, if they do, they migrate as heterogeneous smears. Agarose gels or combination polyacrylamide-agarose gels may be useful in this situation. Several analytical options are available to investigate the presence of glycans further (e.g., the PAS stain described above). Treatment of glycoproteins with endoglycosidases (e.g., peptide-N-glycosidase F [PNGase F], endoglycosidase F2 [Endo F2], endoglycosidase H [Endo H]) is another option; see Table 50.1 and Figure 50.1. If this results in a mobility change of one or more of the bands on the gel, the presence of N-glycans is indicated. O-glycanase (endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase; Table 50.1) can be used for the specific identification of O-glycans. However, depending on the structure of the O-glycan, pretreatment with other enzymes to expose the disaccharide core is sometimes required. Removal of individual sugars by exoglycosidases such as sialidase or β-galactosidase (Figure 50.1) may also result in a mobility change if a sufficient number of residues is removed. Some glycans cannot be altered by these treatments as they are resistant to the enzymes used. Resistance can result from modifications to glycan hydroxyl groups (e.g., sulfation, acetylation, or phosphorylation; Chapter 2), glycosidic linkages that are not recognized by the enzymes, or steric inaccessibility of the glycan. Complete removal of N- and O-glycans can be achieved by chemical treatments (e.g., hydrazinolysis or β-elimination), but peptide damage usually precludes further analysis by gel electrophoresis. Partial degradation (e.g., by loss of O-acetylation) of the glycan may also occur.Glycosidases used for structural analysis. (Left) A biantennary N-glycan is shown with exoglycosidases that remove each monosaccharide sequentially. Exoglycosidases act only on terminal sugars. Also shown are endoglycosidases that digest in the core region (more...)Table of enzymes for glycan analysis Proteoglycans (Chapter 17) may be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and by ion-exchange chromatography, which separates on the basis of charge conferred by sulfate groups. Treatment of proteoglycans with GAG lyases (Table 50.1) will produce a shift in mobility on a gel, condensing the proteoglycan smear into discrete bands. After removal of much of the glycan portion, antibodies that recognize the remaining “stub” glycans may be used in western analysis.Typically, the analysis of glycolipid glycans by NMR or MS is preceded by their chromatographic purification. Mixtures of glycolipids can be fractionated by TLC and TLC plates stained with glycan-reactive reagents, allowing detection of many individual glycolipids. Using different reagents, it is possible to recognize gangliosides (e.g., resorcinol-HCl detects Sia) or neutral monosaccharides (e.g., orcinol-sulfuric acid detects all monosaccharides) in TLC bands. Reagents are also available for detection of sulfate and phosphate groups on glycolipids. Some pre-purification of the crude extract is usually required (e.g., Folch partitioning and ion-exchange chromatography). These procedures separate nonpolar or nonionic lipids from polar lipids (e.g., glycosphingolipids; Chapter 11) and those that contain charged groups (i.e., gangliosides, phospholipids, and sulfatides). It is also common practice to deduce the presence of specific sugars by evaluating the shifts produced in the migration position of a band following a chemical or enzymatic treatment. Glycolipids on TLC plates can also be detected by monoclonal antibodies, lectins, or even intact microorganisms expressing glycan-specific receptors (Chapter 48). Detailed structural features may be identified by running the TLC in a second dimension following a specific treatment. On a larger scale, glycolipids are separated using column chromatography or by high-performance TLC on silica plates.GPI-anchored proteins (Chapter 12), with their lipid, protein, and glycan constituents, have unique physicochemical properties that can be exploited for their detection. The nonionic detergent Triton X-114 at low temperature (4°C) extracts soluble and integral membrane proteins, as well as GPI-anchored proteins. When the solution is warmed, two phases separate, and GPI-anchored and other amphiphilic proteins remain associated with the detergent-enriched phase. GPI-specific phospholipases can be used to cleave GPI anchors for further characterization. Successful cleavage by GPI-specific phospholipases can be assessed using SDS-PAGE, because removal of the GPI anchor causes a shift in molecular mass. This is a common diagnostic method for identifying the presence of a GPI anchor on a protein of interest. Another method is to treat the GPI-anchored protein with nitrous acid, which cleaves the unsubstituted glucosamine residue that links the glycan to the phosphatidylinositol.This class of glycans contains many structures, including homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides, neutral and ionic polysaccharides, and linear and branched structures, with widespread molecular sizes ranging from a few monosaccharide units to thousands (Chapters 3, 21, and 22). Most of these polymers are insoluble in aqueous solutions, occurring as complex and sometimes crystalline aggregates. But many can be extracted with water, salts, chaotropic agents, or detergents and isolated by precipitation with alcohols. Detection is based on refractive index (RI) or colorimetric reactions, because sample quantity is not usually a limitation.Once the presence and general type of glycan has been established, the next challenge is to release specific types of glycans and separate different classes in sufficient quantities for structural characterization.When glycans are released before structural analysis, it is best to use a quantitative release procedure that neither destroys nor alters the glycan. Ideally, information regarding the type of linkage between the glycan and its liberated protein or lipid should be retained, although this is not always possible. Glycolipids can often be isolated and characterized by MS and/or NMR without the need for release of glycans, but, if necessary, enzymatic methods can be used, or for glycosphingolipids, ozonolysis will separate lipid from glycan. Complex, hybrid and oligomannose N-glycans can be released from glycoproteins with N-glycosidases such as PNGase F or PNGase A (Table 50.1). Endo H may be used for the selective release of high-mannose and hybrid N-glycans, but complex N-glycans are resistant (Table 50.1; Figure 50.1).Chemical approaches suitable for release of glycans from a protein include hydrazinolysis, which releases N-glycans and/or O-glycans, depending on experimental conditions. Strong base treatment can, under carefully controlled conditions, release only O-glycans in a process called β-elimination; it is generally accompanied by reduction with borohydride to give an alditol. More recently methods have been developed in which base treatment is accompanied by derivatization with pyrazolone, which acts as a UV-absorbing label during chromatographic separation. However, all of the above chemical methods can result in partial or complete loss of labile modifications of the glycan, such as O-acetylation or sulfation, and degradation of the protein.Glycans released from a glycoconjugate usually form a complex mixture. Even when only one glycosylation site in the protein is occupied, individual molecules can bear different glycan species generating multiple glycoforms. The high-throughput analysis of these glycan mixtures using glycomics technologies is described in Chapter 51.Preparation of glycan samples for structural analysis will rely on separation techniques. Chromatographic separations commonly used to isolate pure glycans, or at least glycan mixtures of reduced complexity, include size exclusion chromatography (SEC), strong or weak anion exchange chromatography (SAX or WAX), and some forms of reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Electrophoretic methods include capillary electrophoresis (CE) and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE).HPLC-based separation is feasible, even for large amounts (>10 mg), if the mixture contains fewer than approximately 50 glycan species. Individual fractions can be recovered for further structural analysis by MS or NMR. Once liberated from their glycoconjugates, glycans with free-reducing termini (Chapter 2) can be chemically labeled with fluorescent tags, such as 2-amino benzoic acid (2-AA) and 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) or 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS), providing detection sensitivity that rivals the sensitivity achieved with radiolabels. Advantages of this method include more facile purification of the labeled glycans and a wider variety of options for chromatographic separations and structural analysis techniques. Nonlabeled glycans may be detected by (relatively insensitive) RI methods, or by more sensitive pulsed amperometric detection (PAD).If a label is introduced at the reducing end, it is possible to use sequential exoglycosidase treatments (Table 50.1; Figure 50.1) and look for shifts of the oligosaccharide in a chromatographic system (e.g., paper chromatography, HPLC, TLC) as an indication of susceptibility to the enzyme. Comparison with known standards treated in the same manner allows tentative glycan identification. However, well-characterized standards of known structure are difficult to obtain in a pure form and there are nearly always “contaminating” peaks in a chromatogram that cannot be readily identified. It is very important to note that separation profiling should not be confused with actual structural analysis, because coelution with a standard could occur with a variety of different structures.Some qualitative information on monosaccharide composition of a glycan may be derived from the procedures described above. However, it is often convenient and informative to determine monosaccharide composition without prior release of glycans. After total hydrolysis of a glycan into its monosaccharide constituents, colorimetric reactions can be used to determine the total amount of hexose, hexuronic acid, or hexosamine in a sample. These approaches only require common reagents and a spectrophotometer, but determination of total glycan content may not always be accurate because of variations in the sensitivities of different linkages to hydrolysis, variations in the degradation of individual saccharides, or a lack of specificity and/or sensitivity in the assays.Quantitative monosaccharide analysis provides estimated molar ratios of individual monosaccharide components of glycans and may suggest the presence of specific oligosaccharide classes (e.g., N-glycans vs. O-glycans). The analysis involves the following steps: cleavage of all glycosidic linkages (typically by acid hydrolysis), fractionation of the resulting monosaccharides, detection, and quantification. Since the early 1960s, a variety of gas chromatography (GC) methods have been developed to quantify monosaccharides. The most useful involve coupling of GC and MS for linkage and composition information. GC requires volatile samples so the monosaccharides are first chemically modified at their hydroxyl, amide, carboxyl, and aldehyde groups. Reduction of the aldehyde of free monosaccharides followed by acetylation of their hydroxyl groups provides derivatives termed “alditol acetates.” These modified monosaccharides can be readily analyzed by GC-MS and compared with authentic standards. The hydroxyl and amino groups of free monosaccharides generated by glycan hydrolysis can also be converted to trimethylsilyl ethers. These per-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives are widely used for monosaccharide compositional analysis by GC-MS. Incorporation of an optically pure chiral aglycone (e.g., [–]-2-butyl alcohol), in combination with trimethylsilylation, allows the GC separation of D and L isomers and thus determination of the absolute configuration of each monosaccharide.An alternative to GC-MS is high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), a special type of ion exchange chromatography which does not require monosaccharide derivatization. This technique is especially useful for analyzing acidic sugars such as Sia, which are refractory to GC-MS. A convenient method for quantitating Sia, that does not require expensive equipment, involves tagging with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene-dioxybenzene and measuring fluorescence. This method has a detection sensitivity in the femtomole range, and can also pick up many of the naturally occurring modifications of this diverse class of monosaccharides (Chapter 15). Other popular techniques for defining monosaccharide composition are HPLC and high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE). The monosaccharides are usually tagged with a fluorescent derivative for high-sensitivity detection. Tagging with 8-amino-1,3,6-naphthalene trisulfonic acid yields anionic derivatives that can be conveniently analyzed by gel electrophoresis. This is referred to as fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE).Linkage analysis is a well-established and ingenious approach for determining linkage positions. The principle of this method is to introduce a stable substituent (an ether-linked methyl group) onto each free hydroxyl group of the native glycan. Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol). This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide. However, linkage analysis provides no information on the nature of substituents or sequence information and cannot reveal α- or β-anomeric configuration.(See following page.) An example of linkage analysis showing a bacterial O-linked branched hexasaccharide with a sequence of Rha1-3Glc1-(Glc1-3GlcNAc1-)2,6Glc1-6GlcNAc. The O-glycan is reductively eliminated from protein before successive steps of permethylation, (more...)EI-MS in monosaccharide composition and linkage analyses is covered above. In this section, the other main types of ionization used in MS analysis of glycans—matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI)—are described. These technologies permit the direct ionization of nonvolatile substances, and are applicable to intact glycoconjugates, as well as fragments thereof. These techniques continue to exploit sample handling strategies and knowledge of glycan fragmentation pathways originally developed for the earlier fast atom bombardment (FAB)-MS. Among the structural features that can be defined by MS methods are (1) degree of heterogeneity and type of glycosylation (e.g., N-glycan vs. O-glycan; oligomannose, hybrid, or complex N-glycans); (2) sites of glycosylation and identity of the protein/lipid carrier; (3) glycan branching; (4) number and lengths of antennae, their composition, and substitution with Fuc, Sia, or other capping groups such as sulfate, phosphate, or acetyl esters; and (5) complete sequences of individual glycans.In MALDI-MS experiments, the sample is dried on a metal target in the presence of a light-absorbing matrix until matrix crystals containing trapped sample molecules are formed. Ionization of the sample is affected by energy transfer from matrix molecules that have absorbed energy from laser pulses. MALDI-MS is the preeminent technique for screening for molecular ions in complex mixtures, and it is a powerful tool for glycomic profiling (Chapter 51). For ESI-MS, a stream of liquid containing the sample enters the source through a capillary interface, where the sample molecules are stripped of solvent, leaving them as multiply charged species. ESI-MS can be coupled to nano- or capillary-bore LC permitting online LC/ESI-MS analysis. This method is particularly useful when complex mixtures of peptides and glycopeptides are being analyzed (e.g., after proteolytic digestion of a glycoprotein).In principle, MS provides two types of structural information—the masses of intact molecules (the molecular ions) and the masses of fragment ions. However, in both ESI- and MALDI-MS, the ionization process is usually not sufficiently energetic for fragment ion formation. To overcome this, ESI and MALDI instruments normally have two analyzers in tandem, which allows detection by the second analyzer, of fragment ions produced after molecular ions selected by the first analyzer undergo collisions with an inert gas in a chamber placed between the two analyzers. This is referred to as collision-activated dissociation (CAD) or collision-induced dissociation (CID). MALDI-MS/MS is commonly performed on instruments that have two time-of-flight (TOF) analyzers in tandem (TOF-TOF), whereas the most popular instruments for ESI-MS/MS have either a quadrupole (Q) as the first analyzer and an orthogonal TOF as the second analyzer (QTOF) or a linear ion trap as the first analyzer and an Orbitrap as the second analyzer (LTQ-Orbitrap). Some MS/MS instruments have a single “ion trap” analyzer that traps ions and functions as the collision chamber. Ion traps are relatively inexpensive, but they lack the sensitivity, versatility, and mass range of most tandem instruments. The Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS), a very expensive but very powerful instrument, has extremely high mass accuracy. An alternative to CAD for fragment ion production has been developed for FTMS. This is called electron capture dissociation (ECD) and involves the capture of an electron by the multiply charged molecular ion. A related technique, called electron transfer dissociation (ETD) was subsequently developed for tandem instruments. Both ECD and ETD yield radical cations generated by different fragmentation pathways than ions produced by CAD. ECD and ETD are especially useful for defining glycosylation sites in glycopeptides.Although underivatized glycans can be analyzed by MALDI- or ESI-MS/MS, superior data can be obtained if the glycans are derivatized before MS analysis. Derivatization methods can be broadly divided into two categories: (1) “tagging” of reducing ends and (2) protection of all functional groups. Commonly used tagging reagents include p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, 2-AP and 2-AB. This type of derivatization facilitates chromatographic purification and enhances useful fragmentation. Protection of hydroxyl groups by permethylation is by far the most important type of full derivatization used in glycan MS (although with accompanying destruction of acetyl esters and other base-labile functional groups during the derivatization process). In MS/MS experiments, permethylated derivatives form abundant fragment ions produced by cleavage at susceptible glycosidic linkages, notably on the reducing side of each HexNAc residue. In N- and O-glycans, this preferred fragmentation unambiguously establishes the antennae sequences. MALDI- and ESI-MS can equally be applied to the characterization of glycolipid and GAG derived glycans. However, in the latter case, because of the size and high degree of sulfation of GAGs, MS analysis is usually performed after hydrolysis of the polymeric chain.As described above, mass spectrometry measures the mass to charge ratio of glycans during the analytical process. However, as multiple monosaccharides that make up a glycan can have the same mass (e.g., mannose, galactose and glucose) and monosaccharides can be linked together in different ways, a single peak in a glycan mass spectrum can actually be made up of multiple structural isomers. Ion mobility mass spectrometry additionally separates ions based on their size and shape which can resolve glycan structural isomers with the same mass to charge ratio (see Further Reading).Broadly speaking, the unique strengths of MS can be exploited in two general ways in glycobiology. The first is to obtain detailed characterization of purified individual glycans or mixtures of glycans. In this type of study, it is essential to acquire sufficient rigorous data to define structure unambiguously; many different MS-based experiments will be required, often complemented by NMR, linkage analysis, and profiling of enzyme digests. The second is to pursue glycomics investigations in situations in which it may not be essential to define structures fully, and high-throughput glycomic profiling or mass-mapping procedures in combination with specific glycosylhydrolases can be exploited (Chapter 51).NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool capable of full de novo structural characterization of isolated glycans and simple glycan mixtures. Among its several advantages are its broad applicability (glycans contain an abundance of hydrogen (1H), the most easily detected magnetic nucleus), its nondestructive nature, the quantitative relationship between resonance intensity and residue concentration, the diverse set of experiments available, and the ability to return information on primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Its principal limitation is sensitivity, typically requiring several nanomoles of glycan for even the simplest structure determination. Other limitations for both structural and metabolic applications are the relatively high cost of spectrometers and the level of expertise required for acquiring and interpreting NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there are emerging experiments using methods, such as dynamic nuclear polarization and looped, projected spectroscopy (L-PROSY), that provide several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for applications that can monitor rapid in vivo conversions of metabolites such as glucose and fructose. Diffusion-based methods can also yield spectra of mixtures of components, separated by diffusion constants (effective molecular size).When small amounts of sample are available and the source of the sample is known, the acquisition of a 1D 1H NMR spectrum, combined with simple 2D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), can frequently identify a glycan. A 1D 1H NMR spectrum can be collected on ∼30 µg of a decasaccharide in ∼20 min on a state-of-the-art spectrometer (900 MHz with a cryoprobe). The anomeric 1H resonances are usually well-resolved in a relatively noncrowded region of the spectrum and show characteristic scalar couplings that are small for most α anomers and significantly larger for most β anomers. Thus, a first glance at the 1H -NMR spectrum gives a good estimate of how many residues there are (one anomeric 1H per residue except for Sia and KDOs) in a given oligosaccharide and how many of them belong to each anomeric type. NMR also provides a good estimate of how many residues are in a repeating unit of a polysaccharide. Connections from the anomeric (H1) resonances to the H2 and subsequently other resonances of a scalar coupled spin system can usually be seen in 2D TOCSY data, which show chemical shifts (resonance positions) for coupled 1Hs as crosspeaks on columns or rows emanating from an anomeric resonance (a ∼12-h acquisition for a 30-µg sample). The chemical shifts of two or more connected 1Hs are often sufficient to identify a residue. For example, the downfield (higher ppm) position and small couplings of three H2 resonances connected by crosspeaks to three α-anomeric resonances can identify these as belonging to core Man residues of an N-glycan. Historically, a collection of easily resolved resonances, often from 1D spectra, sensitive to both monosaccharide type and linkage type, were called reporter group resonances. These often prove sufficient to identify a glycan, particularly when options are restricted by knowledge of biosynthetic pathways in the system under study.Today, it is possible to greatly extend glycan identification by including 13C chemical shifts correlated with directly bonded 1Hs using 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (Figure. 50.3). 13C is magnetically active, but 13C spectroscopy is less sensitive than 1H spectroscopy. To improve sensitivity, 13C chemical shifts are indirectly detected through 1Hs. Even with the improved detection, 13C is only 1% naturally abundant, and unless the sample is isotopically enriched, approximately two orders of magnitude more material is required for collection of these data. Improvements in NMR hardware can reduce the quantities or time required and allow hybrid experiments, such as 2D HSQC-TOCSY, also illustrated in Figure 50.3. Furthermore, significant spectral overlap can be overcome with recent 2D NMR experiments optimized by using direct detection on 13C combined with optimized data processing. Web-based computational tools that rely on empirical rules or databases that correlate chemical shifts with structural features now exist, and these allow facile prediction of possible structures from 1D and 2D NMR data (e.g., CASPER).Sections of 2D 1H-13C 700 MHz NMR spectra of a sialyl Lewis x–capped glycan in D2O. In this example, the combination of heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and HSQC-total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra is used to assign the (more...)When unprecedented structures emerge, it is also possible to perform a de novo structure determination using NMR data alone. This usually begins with a full assignment of the 1H and 13C resonances for each residue of a glycan using a combination of COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and HSQC-TOCSY spectra. In addition, 2D heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC or LR-HSQMBC) experiments are used to detect through-bond coupling between the anomeric 1H and the carbon atom on the opposite side of the glycosidic linkage. These are, however, even less sensitive and more time-consuming experiments. It is possible to avoid both 13C-based HSQC and HMBC experiments by substituting a 2D nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectrum. In medium size glycans (1 kDa), NOE crosspeaks may go unobserved because of competition of coherence transfer pathways. Such crosspeaks can be observed using a rotating-frame Overhauser effect (ROE) spectrum. Both experiments correlate 1H resonances based on inter-1H distances, as opposed to through-bond couplings; they typically show crosspeaks for pairs of 1Hs that are within ∼4 Å of one another. Most connections are between 1Hs in the same residue, but typically an extra connection will be between an anomeric 1H and a 1H in another residue. This 1H is frequently across the glycosidic bond at the linkage site, providing a way to assemble residues into a complete structure. However, caution must be exercised. The identification of linkage sites is not as definitive as with 13C-based experiments, because the distance for the trans-glycosidic pair is dependent on glycosidic torsion angles, and these NOE crosspeaks can be weak. Also, other nonlinkage site protons can come within NOE distance and give false identification.The same NOE crosspeaks that assist in identifying linkages between residues can, in principle, be used to define the tertiary (3D) structure of a glycan. However, the interpretation is complicated by the presence of internal molecular motion, resulting in many different conformations in solution. This motion is nicely illustrated in ϕ–ψ energy plots much like the Ramachandran plots used to describe the energetics of torsional angles in the polypeptide backbone of a protein. For glycans, these plots are usually based on parameterized functions that represent a combination of quantum mechanical and experimental data. Such a plot is shown for a Glcβ1-4Glc linkage in Figure 50.4. The minima in these plots correlate well with angles found in structures of glycans deposited in databases such as the Cambridge Structural Database or the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Multiple minima indicate that multiple conformations are likely to be present in solution and therefore imply that there is conformational motion for the disaccharide. Thermal energies available to molecules at these temperatures are ∼0.6 kcal, so in solution, states within ∼1.4 kcal of the minimum have appreciable populations (>10%), representing a ±20° variation in torsion angles about those of the most stable form of the Glcβ1-4Glc linkage. In NMR experiments, intensities of NOE crosspeaks are roughly proportional to the average of the inverse sixth power of the distance sampled over these states, and the steep distance dependence results in skewing distances toward smaller numbers. Nevertheless, NOEs, particularly those representing close approach of remote parts of larger glycans, can guide construction of 3D structural models. Convenient tools for building structures are available, such as the carbohydrate builder of the GLYCAM package. Initial structures can be further refined with molecular mechanics or molecular dynamics software packages, or they can be manipulated in common molecular graphics packages to match solution data coming from NOEs and other NMR measurements, including residual dipolar couplings and paramagnetic effects, which provide angular and long range distance constraints respectively (Chapter 30).Energy plots showing likely ϕ–ψ values for the glycosidic torsion angles between Glc residues in Glcβ1-4Glc-OMe. Regions in green indicate a likely combination of ϕ and ψ, or conformation, whereas red regions (more...)The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Carolyn R.

Karlsson, Kay-Hooi Khoo, Morten Thaysen-Andersen, Lance Wells, and Nicolle H. Packer.The term genomics arose from the availability of complete genome sequence data as well as computational methods for their analysis. However, <2% of genes in the human genome encode proteins. These genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that make up the “transcriptome,” of which ∼30% are assigned to protein coding. The total complement of proteins expressed by the cell is collectively termed the “proteome.” Most eukaryotic proteins are post translationally modified (e.g., by phosphorylation, sulfation, oxidation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, lipidation, or glycosylation). These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher. The systems-level analysis of all proteins expressed by cells, tissues, or organisms is known as “proteomics.” The proteome, like the transcriptome, but unlike the DNA sequence of the genome, is fundamentally dynamic. The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle. As cells receive external and internal cues in the form of growth factors, hormones, metabolites, or cell–cell interactions, the expression of various genes is modulated and may be transcribed at levels ranging from silence to more than 104 mRNA copies per cell and 107 protein molecules per cell. Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation.However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome.Vertebrates synthesize N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids (Chapters 11 and 12), proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors covalently attached to proteins, as well as free oligosaccharides (Chapter 3). As with the proteome, each cell type has its own distinct glycome that is governed by local cues and the metabolic state of the cell. Other organisms have distinct glycomes; those of plants (Chapter 24) and prokaryotes (Chapter 21) are distinctly different from the vertebrate and invertebrate glycomes (Chapters 25–27).The size of any particular cellular glycome has not yet been established, but the combinatorial possibilities that can occur with numerous glycan structures on multiple glycoconjugates means that determining a “complete” glycome is not straightforward. The notion that glycans should be studied as a totality (glycomics), as well as simply one glycan or glycoconjugate at a time, developed when it became apparent that glycans form patterns on cells that change during development (Chapter 41), cancer progression (Chapter 47), infection (Chapters 42 and 43), and many other diseases (Chapters 44–46). Many glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins, are oligomerized on the cell surface and interact with multivalent arrays of glycans on the same or opposing cells (Chapters 28–38). Sometimes, multiple discrete glycans and their matching glycan-binding proteins work together to engage two cells or to deliver signals between cells. Thus, the term “glycomics” was coined to describe the many aspects of glycobiology that can be understood only with a systems-level analysis of the glycome.Clues regarding the composition and complexity of the glycome are found in the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of a cell. Thus, if a gene encoding a glycosyltransferase is not expressed (absent from the transcriptome), no glycans in that cell can carry the sugar transferred by that glycosyltransferase at that particular time. The action of many glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases competing for the same substrates in the biosynthetic pathway renders the complete glycome impossible to predict with current tools and knowledge. As an example, the reduced expression of a single glycosyltransferase can perturb the biosynthesis of dozens of glycans. Furthermore, unlike the genome, the glycome is sensitive to exogenous nutrient levels and metabolic fluxes including salvage pathways. Thus, variations in dietary monosaccharides, such as glucose, galactose, glucosamine, fucose, mannose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Chapter 15), may change the composition of the glycome. The numerous factors that influence the glycome (the transcriptome, the proteome, environmental nutrients, the secretory machinery, pH, and many other determinants) create a glycome that is highly diverse, adaptable, and dynamic. Thus, the glycome of a cell can change dramatically over time. It is this enormous structural plasticity in response to cellular and environmental states that underlies the essential roles of glycans in development, communication, and disease processes.Because the glycome is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, the information contained therein sheds light on intra- and interspecies variations, including providing indicators of disease that can be used for diagnosis and for monitoring the efficacy of drugs. Comparative glycomics, the comparison of glycome profiles obtained from two or more individuals, tissues, or conditions of interest, is therefore an exciting frontier in biology and medicine.For example, as discussed in detail in Chapter 47, numerous changes in the glycome have been associated with malignancy and metastasis, including altered N- and O- linked protein glycosylation, up-regulation of conjugated sialylated and fucosylated glycans, and altered GAGs. Regardless of functional consequence, a change in the glycome that is highly correlated with malignancy (or any disease) may serve as a diagnostic marker candidate. Notably, glycans altered in a disease may reflect downstream consequences of the disease on remote organs, changes in the patient\\'s immune system, or other effects of the disease.One major caveat is the currently unknown extent of natural variation among individual human glycomes. The glycome is known to respond to dietary and environmental changes and vary in elusive ways with age, gender, and acquired disease susceptibility (Chapter 46). Studies of evolutionary biology also have much to gain from comparative glycomics. Evolution of the vertebrate immune system, for example, was accompanied by the acquisition of new classes of glycan-binding proteins, including Siglecs (Chapter 35) and selectins (Chapter 34). Likewise, the glycomes and glycan-binding proteins of microbes and their vertebrate hosts appear to have coevolved in some instances (Chapter 42).The glycome can be determined at different levels of granularity. First, “glycomics” constructs an inventory of glycans separated from their protein or lipid scaffolds from the cell, organ, or organism of interest. This is an important starting point for any comprehensive glycome analysis. The second level of analysis defines specific glycans associated with individual proteins or lipids. Analysis of the complete repertoire of a cell\\'s glycoconjugates, including the microheterogeneity of glycans present at individual sites of attachment, lies, for example, at the intersection of glycomics and proteomics (“glycoproteomics”) and of glycomics and lipidomics (“glycolipidomics”). A third level of complexity involves determining which glycans and/or glycoconjugates are expressed in specific cells, tissues, or secretions at specific times or conditions. This level of analysis is essential if the goal is to reveal new functions in cell–cell communication or to correlate particular glycomes with specific diseases. Of course, none of these approaches recapitulates the actual arrangement of the complex glycan forest present on the surface of cells or in extracellular matrices. The spatial organization of the glycome on cell surfaces is currently only amenable to microscopy-, array- and flow cytometry–based imaging using various glycan-recognizing probes (lectins/GRPs; Chapter 48). The spatial organization of glycans in tissue sections can also be explored by recent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS imaging methods.The term “glycomics” thus describes studies designed to define the complete repertoire of glycans that a cell, tissue, or organism produces under specified conditions of time, location, and environment. “Glycoproteomics” describes this glycome as it appears on the cellular proteome. Glycoproteomics determines which sites on each glycoprotein of a cell are glycosylated and ideally includes the identification and quantitation of the heterogeneous glycan structures at each site. The molecular complexity of the glycoproteome makes glycomics and glycoproteomics both exciting and daunting. Because neither the genome, transcriptome, nor the proteome can accurately predict the dynamically expressed protein-linked glycans, the glycome and glycoproteome must be analyzed directly. Techniques used to characterize a single glycoprotein after isolation (Figure 51.1) or a complex mixture of glycoproteins (the glycoproteome) (Figure 51.2) are described in this chapter.Analysis of a purified single glycoprotein. Example of the characterization of an affinity purified serum glycoprotein, haptoglobin, including (left panel) a total glycomics profile of N-glycans released from the protein, fluorescently derivatized with (more...)Glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics of a complex mixture of glycoproteins. In this workflow, the structures of the PNGase F released N-glycans from a total extract of rat brain membrane proteins are first analyzed in detail (1) and the sites of glycosylation (more...)As described below, numerous techniques have been developed for interrogating the glycome and glycoproteome. Because no single technique can at present define all aspects of the glycome or glycoproteome, several approaches are typically used in parallel from assembling an individual cell type glycan repertoire to determining the global tissue expression for example. Different approaches and techniques are required to characterize, for example, the structures of glycoproteins versus glycolipids, N-glycans versus O-glycans, and sulfated GAGs versus neutral glycans (Chapter 50). In contrast, a single technique such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to identify and quantitate all mRNA transcripts at once, a much easier task.Glycomic methods and analyses have been mostly directed toward protein glycosylation because of the current proteomics focus, although considerable effort is being directed toward methods that encompass all glycan conjugates. As an example of a typical experiment, a glycoprotein-enriched sample is prepared from a cell lysate and their released glycans analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) and/or mass spectrometry (MS). In the case of glycoproteins, the N-glycans can be selectively released enzymatically or chemically, separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, and are often sequenced online by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with or without exoglycosidase treatments. Separately, the O-glycans may be released chemically and sequenced in a similar manner. In contrast, glycolipids can often be directly sequenced with or without release from the lipid component. GAGs are more problematic because of their large size and negative charge, but disaccharide fragments can be sequenced by LC or MS in conjunction with enzymatic digestion (Chapter 17).Depending on the level of detail desired, glycomic analyses may be divided into basic techniques: glycoprofiling, glycan class characterization, and full structural analysis of the glycans released from protein(s). The level of detail should ideally be tailored to the particular question at hand.Full structural analysis of glycans is challenging as different structures can have the same mass, often coelute on separation systems, and can require detailed manual annotation of MS/MS spectra. Usually glycans are given a preliminary structural assignment from one technology and are then confirmed by at least one orthogonal technology. Bioinformatic tools are being developed to try to mitigate this bottleneck (Chapter 52).The starting material in a glycomic analysis can be glycoproteins embedded in gels, protein extracts from whole cell lysates, homogenized tissues, enriched membrane fractions, or serum and other body fluids. For high-throughput analyses of the glycome, intact N-glycans are most often released from glycoproteins using an amidase (peptide N-glycosidase F [PNGase F]). PNGase F cleaves the linkage between the core GlcNAc and the asparagine residue in the NXT/S (X≠P) sequon, of all classes of N-glycans, with the exception of specific N-glycans found in plant and invertebrate glycoproteins that contain fucose α(1,3) linked to the core GlcNAc residue attached to the protein. PNGase A, an enzyme extracted from almond emulsion, may be used to release all core fucosylated N-glycans from protease-generated glycopeptides. Treatment with other endoglycosidase enzymes that cleave between the two GlcNAc residues within the chitobiose core (e.g., endoglycosidase D, which releases paucimannosidic N-linked glycans, endoglycosidase H, which selectively cleaves oligomannose- and hybrid-type structures and various types of endoglycosidase F) is also possible. Before treatment, denaturation both with and without trypsin digestion can be used to relax the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the protein and improve enzyme accessibility. N-glycans can also be conveniently released from glycoproteins purified in SDS-PAGE gel bands. After the N-glycans have been cleaved, the protein remaining in the gel can be identified by traditional proteomics.For O-linked glycan release from serine (S) and threonine (T) the method of choice is chemical reductive β-elimination. Drawbacks of the method include the fact that the resultant O-linked alditols cannot be further labeled at the reducing end, and that labile modifications can be destroyed during the release process. To date, there is no enzyme that can release all classes of O-linked glycans. The enzyme O-glycanase (in contrast to the PNGase enzymes) is restricted to releasing only simple core 1 (Galβ1-3GalNAcαS/T) O-glycans.Labeling of released glycans can optimize HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE) detectability and separability and may improve their MS properties. Many of these labeling approaches use reductive amination of the glycan at the reducing end or react the free amine at the reducing end that is left after PNGase F release. Fluorescent tags increase the sensitivity by lowering the limit of quantitation and detection. Permethylation and peracetylation, when all the mobile protons (present on hydroxyls, carboxyls, and amides) in a glycan are substituted by alkyls (e.g., -methyl) or esterified (e.g., -acetyl) convert the glycans from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic, making the glycans easier to purify and greatly improves the sensitivity and linkage determination by MS-based analyses.Both N- and O-glycans can also be analyzed as alditols in which the reducing end monosaccharide ring is converted into a reduced linear alditol by reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride. This reduction removes the anomeric ambiguity of the carbohydrate, where the α- and β-isomers of the reducing end sugar may otherwise separate into two peaks chromatographically.Tagging of the reducing ends of the released glycans (e.g., with 2-aminobenzamide [2-AB], aminobenzoic acid [2-AA], or aminopyridine [2-PA]) is often used for HILIC and reversed-phase LC separation of released glycans (Figure 51.1). Labeled dextran oligomer ladders are commonly used in LC as external standards to help define composition and size based on comparable retention times, for which an “incremental value” can be calculated for each monosaccharide present in the structure (Figure 51.1).CE with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) can also provide efficient, rapid, and quantitative separation of derivatized glycans. Glycans are mostly neutral structures so coupling a charged fluorescent label such as 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid (APTS) is necessary to provide electrophoretic mobility and to enable sensitive fluorescence detection. Further details can be assigned after digestion of glycan mixtures by one or more exoglycosidases that specifically cleave glycosidic bonds of individual monosaccharide units from the terminal residue producing predictable shifts in the HPLC or CE (or MS) profiles of the digests.Special derivatization protocols have also been developed to improve the quality of the MS fragmentation spectra of sialylated glycans—in particular, to target the charged carboxyl group of sialic acid residues. These can be converted into esters or amides to remove the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid that destabilizes the sialic acid in MALDI-MS and promotes undesirable in-source or post-source fragmentation in MS/MS. Specific derivatization of sialic acid residues can also help to determine by MS whether they are 2,3- or 2,6-linked to the glycan structure.An advantage of mass spectrometric glycan profiling is that different glycans can be identified at once by their mass and diagnostic fragmentation ions, increasing the throughput of the glycomic analysis. However, mass spectrometry of glycans may miss potentially important labile modifications, such as sulfation and O-acetylation, depending on the sample preparation and MS techniques applied. MS has inherent challenges because of the isomeric and sometimes isobaric nature of the constituent monosaccharide units that form multiple glycan isomers exhibiting the same molecular mass.Determining the molecular masses of glycans using MALDI- or ESI-MS gives a picture of the molecular distribution of glycans and allows a quantitative comparison of glycosylation between samples (Chapter 50). The limited number of masses of the monosaccharide units (Table 51.1) makes combinatorial translation of molecular ion masses to monosaccharide composition possible albeit often with some remaining ambiguity. There are available search engines that can provide a suggested list of glycan compositions based on an experimentally determined mass (e.g., GlycoMod; Chapter 52). MS alone, however, cannot distinguish between isomeric monosaccharides, so a nomenclature for generic monosaccharide compositions has been adopted. For instance, all of the isomeric 6-carbon-containing monosaccharides, such as glucose, mannose, and galactose are given the unifying name of hexose (Hex) (Table 51.1).Families of common monosaccharides found in mammalian N- and O-linked glycans Elucidation of variable linkage configurations, and glycan branch points is another analytical challenge.Generic glycomic workflows using all the derivatization approaches described above have been developed for MS analysis. Both the neutral and sialylated glycans in a sample can be analyzed after permethylation and MALDI-MS, in which glycan masses are detected as their singly charged alkali ion adducts in positive ion mode (e.g., as [M+Na]+ ions or [M+K]+ ions). Negative ion ESI-MS is widely adopted for intact glycan profiling in their alditol form, in which both neutral and sialylated glycans are detected as deprotonated [M-nH]n− ions. The number of charges (n) will increase with the size of the glycan and is also dependent on the number of acidic moieties present (e.g., sialic acids, sulfates, and phosphates). Positive ion MALDI-MS without permethylation usually requires that sialic acid residues are derivatized as described above to prevent their loss in-source.To obtain orthogonal separations prior to the mass analysis, ESI-MS is often connected to HPLC. HILIC columns can be used for separation of reducing end derivatized glycans and provides separation based on hydrophilicity (which correlates with the glycan size), with some isomeric structure resolution (Figures 51.1 and 51.2). The retention of glycans on such columns is primarily based on hydrogen bonding to water surrounding the HILIC stationary phase (partitioning). Using an alternate stationary phase, porous graphitized carbon (PGC) has shown a unique ability to clearly separate isomers of released glycan alditols based on more complex retention mechanisms. If glycans are permethylated, the increased hydrophobicity allows separation using conventional C18 reversed-phase chromatography. Ion mobility has also been utilized to resolve glycan isomers entering the mass spectrometer. Data from two or more approaches can be used to give confidence in structural assignments and can be facilitated by software that allows automated data analysis (Chapter 52).MS fragmentation has become the gold standard for glycan structural characterization. The goal is to generate information-rich fragment spectra that will allow unequivocal assignment of a glycan structure. However, in the current state of the art, fragments from colliding glycan molecular ions (collision-induced dissociation [CID]—either “beam-type” or “ion trap-type”) can only partly determine the structure of interest. We can distinguish three types of glycan fragment ions depending on the type and amount of information they carry (Figure 51.3).Collision-induced dissociation–tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) of released N-glycans. (A) MS of released N-glycans: Masses are shown as doubly charged ions with corresponding monosaccharide compositions. (B) CID-MS/MS of m/z of [1098.25] (more...)Ideally, a fragmentation spectrum containing all possible glycosidic fragments would allow the assignment of the primary sequence and branching of a glycan structure. In practice, however, most CID approaches provide glycosidic fragments, but several methods or a combination of methods (LC retention times, exoglycosidase digestions, ion mode, derivatization, multiple fragmentation steps, i.e., MSn) are usually used to fully define a particular structure of interest. Biosynthetic rules can be and often are applied to aid the glycan characterization.A further challenge is that many key glycan modifications such as O-acetylation, pyruvylation, etc., are labile to, and/or missed with, current analytical methods. This problem can result in populating databases with misleading or biased information. As just one example, although many databases assume that a sialic acid at the terminus of the vertebrate glycan chain is N-acetylneuraminic acid, there are in fact dozens of kinds of modified sialic acids in nature, and the differences can have profound effects on biological functions (Chapter 15). The same is true of N- and O-sulfate esters on HexNAc and hexosamine residues (Chapters 14 and 17). These analytical challenges are still being pursued. Meanwhile, in many instances, it would make sense to not make definitive positional assignments of modifications on the glycan chains.Releasing the glycans from the protein(s) is currently a prerequisite for glycomics. The described techniques above are, however, complementary to support the assignment of glycan structures still attached to peptides, the techniques for which are less well-developed and present greater challenges (see below). N-linked and O-linked glycomics are still the only techniques that can detail the overall glycan structural landscape of the surface of a cell (if applied in combination with plasma membrane enrichment) so they will continue to be valid approaches in the foreseeable future to define cell–cell interactions and to discover disease biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.However, there may not be a need for de novo analysis of every single glycan in the future. Matching of fragment spectra using fragmentation libraries containing many of the more ubiquitously expressed glycans (Chapter 52) is becoming a pathway to quickly assign a majority of structures fully or partially and allows researchers to focus on validation of only the structures that are important for addressing the biological question. Similar to proteomics, automated glycan identification should ideally be performed with stringent confidence thresholds by, for example, determining the false discovery rate of the reported identifications. Novel fragmentation techniques, the introduction of ion mobility MS, and in vivo or in vitro incorporation of heavy isotopic monosaccharides or tags are starting to provide other opportunities for the isomeric glycan structural characterization, quantitation, and visualization that are currently lacking in glycomic mass spectrometric techniques.A key question that often follows the identification of important glycosylation features by glycomics is, which proteins carry the implicated glycan structures and at which sites? Given that protein glycosylation is dependent on the concerted action of multiple glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases, one might expect all glycoproteins that traffic through the secretory pathway to be equally susceptible to similar modifications. However, protein- and site-specific glycosylation are well-recognized features of protein glycosylation. Although the underlying molecular basis for protein- and site-specific glycosylation is not entirely understood, contributing factors are likely to include common sequence motifs, protein structural conformation, unique physicochemical patches surrounding the glycosylation site, or some yet-unknown traits that collectively allow individual proteins to be sought out from among hundreds or thousands of other proteins to be acted on by the glycosylation machinery in a specific way.The mapping of N-glycosylation sites of formerly glycosylated (de-N-glycosylated) peptides of a complex protein sample is now routinely performed using conventional proteomic approaches. Notably, this approach does not give information on what glycan structure(s) are present on these defined glycosylation sites and as such does not fit well under glycoproteomics. By virtue of the action of PNGase F or Endo F/Endo H, the de-N-glycosylated peptides are mass-tagged by conversion of Asn to Asp (a +1 Da change in peptide mass) within the consensus sequon (Figure 51.2) or by retention of a GlcNAc(±Fuc) at the Asn site, respectively. These previously glycosylated proteins can then be subjected to standard trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis, and the MS/MS data searched against proteomic databases for rapid identification of the N-glycosylation sites on the tryptic peptides. This approach can be coupled to initial affinity or chemical capture of the glycoproteome subset, by use of lectins at the glycoprotein and/or digested glycopeptide level, or by hydrazine capture of the oxidized glycans on the glycopeptide followed by PNGase F release of the captured peptide containing the deamidation of Asn to Asp. In this manner, thousands of N-glycosylation sites can now be routinely identified and their relative occupancy quantified in a single experiment. The use of sequential Endo H followed by PNGase F, given that Endo H only acts on oligomannosidic glycans and PNGase F cannot remove the remaining single GlcNAc attached to an Asn, can provide additional information about N-glycan classes at an individual site. Apart from not being able to inform the site-specific glycoform structures, the most commonly criticized aspect of this approach is the potential of false positives being introduced by spontaneous deamidation of Asn to Asp, which is independent of the action of the PNGase F. Enzymatic deglycosylation in heavy water and/or the use of Endo F/H are ways to reduce the number of false positive identifications arising from this spontaneous deamidation.Innovative approaches using the zinc finger nuclease gene targeting technique, or by using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the C1GalT1 glycosyltransferase gene, which impairs O-glycosylation pathways by preventing extension of the O-GalNAc core, has led to the generation of so-called SimpleCells, in which all synthesized mucin-type O-glycoproteins carry only a single GalNAc or sialyl GalNAc (Chapter 56). The same approach applied to O-mannose initiated glycans resolved a long-standing question concerning the apparent abundance of O-mannose glycans in brain tissue although at the time only a few relatively low abundance proteins had been determined to possess this modification. The SimpleCell technology has greatly facilitated the experimental identification of hundreds and even thousands of O-glycosylation sites, although the actual sites and attached O-glycan structures under more natural and specific physiological states remain unknown.Not every sequon (NXT/S) will carry an N-glycan, and in rare cases the T/S position of utilized sequons can be substituted with C. The actual glycosylated sites usually carry a heterogeneous collection of glycan structures. Glycoproteomics needs ideally to be able to identify all glycoproteins in a sample down to the level of which sites are occupied (macroheterogeneity) and to quantify and characterize their respective glycoforms at that site (microheterogeneity). The ultimate aim is to take snapshots of the distribution of disparate glycans in real-time on each glycoprotein in a cell to infer how site-specific glycosylation may promote or interfere with cellular interactions or signaling events. Ultimately, to understand the specific biological roles of protein glycoforms, we will need to define the population of each molecular species that arises from combinations of site-specific glycan diversity at multiple sites.Although promising glycoproteomics methods have been developed in recent years, the unambiguous identification of intact glycopeptides in complex mixtures using LC-MS/MS remains challenging. The workflows are comparably less mature than the corresponding proteomics methods for the analysis of unmodified peptides or peptides carrying simple modifications. Appropriate false discovery rate (FDR)-based glycopeptide identification strategies are emerging but are still not sufficiently integrated into the workflows such that confident identifications are still dependent on manual interrogation of data by experienced users. Most, if not all, glycoproteomics methods rely on accurate mass analysis of the monoisotopic glycopeptide precursor ions (low ppm) to accurately specify the molecular mass of the intact glycopeptides. The fragment ions also benefit from detection at high resolution to aid the spectral assignment.For N-glycopeptides, CID, either on an ion trap or quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) platform, or increasingly by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), available on a range of Orbitrap mass analyzers, induces mostly glycosidic cleavages, giving rise to abundant glycan oxonium ions in the low mass region, complemented by successive neutral losses of glycosyl residues from the glycopeptide precursors down to a single GlcNAc on the Asn (Figure 51.4A). The abundant diagnostic oxonium ions enable quick and accurate broad classification of all glycopeptide-containing spectra, with details of the monosaccharide composition and topology, and usually is sufficient to allow for confident glycopeptide identification. In favorable cases, the Y1 ion (peptide backbone+GlcNAc) can be assigned and its m/z can be used to define the molecular mass of the peptide carrying the glycan Thereafter, the precursor ion mass gives the composition of the attached glycan after the peptide mass has been subtracted. More recently the use of step-HCD (generating multiple fragmentation spectra of the same species with different collision energies) has been shown to generate rich spectra for assigning both the glycan and the peptide.Complementary tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation of N-glycopeptides. (A) Both collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS and higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD)-MS/MS of glycopeptides produce cleavages of the glycan to give diagnostic (more...)When submitting the more labile O-glycopeptides to CID/HCD fragmentation the glycosyl residues are usually detached from the peptide carrier and therefore produce b- and y-ions without the conjugated glycan. The limitation is also that the modification site(s) cannot be specified.Electron transfer dissociation (ETD) performed with or without additional CID- or HCD-based activation, termed ETciD and EThcD, respectively, represents an alternative fragmentation strategy to achieve more information-rich glycopeptide spectra. In principle, ETD yields c- and z-type ions arising from peptide bond cleavages along the peptide backbone without inducing glycosidic cleavages (Figure 51.4B). The resulting c- and z-ions that still carry the intact glycan are therefore useful to identify both the peptide carrier and the modification site, a feature particularly useful for O-glycopeptides in which site allocation cannot reliably be predicted based on the peptide sequence. The practical problem is that the ETD efficiency is dependent on the charge density of the glycopeptide. Relative low dissociation efficiency is typically observed with doubly and triply charged N-glycopeptides, which constitutes a substantial portion of all tryptic peptides. One way to address this issue is to increase the charge state of the glycopeptides by either chemical derivatization, such as using a tandem mass tag (TMT), by using supercharging agents in the LC solvents and/or by using a different proteolytic enzyme such as LysC or GluC instead of trypsin to generate larger glycopeptides. Using EThcD (supplemental activation) and/or longer ETD activation times may also produce more information rich spectra by promoting dissociation of already charge-reduced nondissociated precursors. ETD works reasonably well with O-glycopeptides, particularly those decorated with only one or two glycosyl residues including O-GlcNAc, O-GalNAc (Tn), O-GalNAc-Gal (T), O-Fuc, and O-Man. By retaining these glycosyl substituents, ETD ideally allows identification of their distribution over several closely placed Ser/Thr residues which is not possible with CID or HCD.Innovative LC-MS/MS acquisition strategies are increasingly being used to enhance the performance of glycoproteomics experiments. For example, abundant HexNAc oxonium ions at m/z 204 arising from HCD-MS/MS fragmentation are useful diagnostic ions for any type of N- and O-linked glycopeptides. Product ion-dependent ETD, or EThcD triggering of precursors giving rise to such HexNAc (or other) oxonium ions, are elegant strategies to tailor the instrument to acquire more glycopeptide specific informative data enabling a higher glycoproteome coverage without the need of prior glycopeptide enrichment.Similar to the quantitation of peptides in proteomics, the quantitation of intact glycopeptides can be performed using either label-free or label-assisted (e.g., TMT) strategies. The type of quantitation depends on the question at hand but may involve relative quantitation of all glycans at each glycosylation site (glycoproteome mapping), comparison of the glycoprofiles of individual sites between conditions (comparative glycoproteomics), or, more simply, determination of the relative abundance of a single glycopeptide form between two or more conditions (biomarker discovery). Multiple quantitative approaches as well as information of the protein level and degree of site occupancy are often required to extract biologically relevant information from glycoproteomics data.A limitation of current glycoproteomics data is that the glycopeptide fragment data do not afford detailed glycan topology, linkage, and stereochemistry information of the attached glycans. Diagnostic fragment ions can sometimes be found confirming terminal epitopes such as a fucosylated Hex-HexNAc or sialylated fucosylated Hex-HexNAc (Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis x, respectively) but these cannot be distinguished from Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis a. Detailed glycan profiling achieved with site resolution (structure-focused glycoproteomics) is an important frontier that should be a goal of the next-generation of glycoproteomics. At this time, continued development of selective enrichment and/or preseparation of specific subsets of glycopeptides needs to be pursued, because no single LC-MSn method or instrument is sufficient to handle the full dynamic range of the entire glycopeptide pool derived from a complete glycoproteome.To limit the search space and enhance the detailed structural knowledge of the glycans encountered in a given glycoproteome, parallel profiling of the glycome can be performed. Such a “glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics” approach (Figure 51.2) can also be complemented with quantitative proteome and de-glycoproteome profiling (mapping of glycosylation sites), which reduce the search space even further and provide supporting evidence to pinpoint the mechanism(s) driving the observed glycoproteome alterations.Although glycoproteomics is rapidly maturing and continues to reach a larger group of scientists, significant analytical challenges remain and the technology is still best performed in “specialist” laboratories because of the demand for manual expert interrogation and interpretation of data. Current glycoproteomics methods cannot identify the full complement of glycans on every site of a mixture of glycoproteins and cannot easily tackle multiply glycosylated peptides especially with both N- and O-linked glycan structures. Defining the relative proportions of different intact glycoform populations is important for understanding biological function. This has only been achieved in a few cases (e.g., by MS analysis of the intact IgG glycoprotein).Several promising informatics initiatives aimed at automating the glycopeptide identification process, aiding the quantitation, and supporting the interpretation of the data output have appeared over recent years. A recent interlaboratory study conducted by the Human Glycoproteomics Initiative of HUPO highlights the importance of different software search parameters for the successful identification and characterization of glycopeptides in order to try to deal with false positives and the reporting of thousands of nonverified glycopeptides. At this stage, for most of the available glycopeptide identification software tools it is strongly advised that manual validation of the glycopeptide assignments still be performed to generate sufficient confidence in the reported identifications. It is therefore clear that the computational solutions require further improvements to advance the field of glycoproteomics and ultimately achieve full integration among other disciplines within the glycosciences (Chapter 52).The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Carolyn R.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.52Kiyoko F. Aoki-Kinoshita, Matthew P. Campbell, Frederique Lisacek, Sriram Neelamegham, William S. York, and Nicolle H. Packer.Glycans are branched, biosynthetic metabolic products that are commonly encoded by multiple genes. Unique genes may be involved in the biosynthesis of specific glycan classes (glycoprotein, glycolipid, glycosaminoglycans etc.), and at the same time, many glycogenes participate in the biosynthesis of more than one glycan class. These intricacies relating to gene expression, enzyme specificity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi compartment–specific localization of enzymes, the branched nature of glycan structures, and species-specific variation in monosaccharide composition makes the analysis of glycosylation processes complicated. To aid this effort, a variety of analytical methods have been developed to identify and quantify the structure of glycans and their conjugates in biological samples. Glycoinformatics tools and software aim to use computers to integrate these experimental data, using our knowledge of glycan biosynthetic pathways as a backbone. Glycoinformatics databases ideally curate experimental data allowing glycan structures to be rigorously defined, archived, organized, searched, and annotated. When linked to other relational databases, glycoscience data may then be integrated with related genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic information. This chapter describes the current status of glycoinformatics databases and software development, with focus on efforts to bridge the gap between glycan structure and function.Informatics plays a critical role in virtually every aspect of modern biology. Our ability to compile the genomes of diverse organisms made it possible to predict the protein sequences. These sequences are widely used as the basis to predict protein function and to enable proteomic analyses. Proteomic studies in turn advance biological research by providing experimental evidence that supports the expression of specific proteins, in particular tissues or cell types (Figure 52.1). The informatics resources that support these endeavors are facilitated by the fact that genes and the translated polypeptides (i.e., proteins) are typically linear molecules whose sequences are readily specified as a series of characters. These representations are easy to digitize and store and many powerful informatics tools for comparing and classifying polypeptides have been developed. In contrast, the development of informatics tools for glycobiology is more difficult for several reasons. Notably, glycans are not directly encoded by genes. Rather, they are the metabolic products of multiple enzyme activities, both glycosyltransferases [GTs] and glycosidases (Chapter 6). These reactions are tightly controlled by the availability of the donor and acceptor substrates in the cellular compartment containing the GT as well as by modulation of enzyme activity and expression levels. In addition, the organization and function of the ER–Golgi biosynthetic pathway is sensitive to many factors such as the metabolic or developmental stage of the cell or its level of nutrients (Chapter 4), and this leads to structures that can be complex (Chapter 3). Furthermore, glycans are often highly branched and their structures cannot be described as a simple linear sequence (Chapter 3).The critical role of glycomics in systems biology. Glycan structures have no template from which to be predicted, are regulated by cellular metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and modify both proteins and lipids. Glycomics thus requires the tools (more...)Because of this biosynthetic and structural complexity, it is not currently possible to accurately predict the structures of the glycans that an organism can produce under different environments or how these glycans are conjugated with other molecules, armed only with knowledge of the genome or proteome. Rather, the identity of each glycan in a biological sample must be identified using analytical methods (Chapter 50 and Chapter 51) that are sufficiently sophisticated to detect and discern the glycan\\'s diverse structural features. Thus, research aimed at understanding the biological roles and consequences of glycan structures depends on the availability of integrated glycoinformatics databases. A consortium of international scientists under the GlySpace Alliance have made considerable progress in this area in recent years to streamline the annotation of glycans and related expression patterns such that they can be linked across diverse databases. Thus, a clearer path from glycan structure to biosynthetic pathways is beginning to emerge from these efforts.Interpreting glycan structural information in the context of diverse types of biological and chemical information is a challenge. For example, most glycans in animals are covalently linked to proteins or lipids. The glycan moieties of a glycoprotein are linked to specific amino acids (usually asparagine, serine, or threonine) (Chapters 9 and 10). Which sites are glycosylated and which structures are present at a particular site often vary, depending on many factors, including the type, developmental stage, and disease state of the cell or tissue. Collection, storage, and retrieval of a description of each protein\\'s glycosylation is time-, tissue-, organism-, interaction-, and disease-dependent and thus presents a major challenge to bioinformaticians working in the glycosciences (glycoinformaticians) as it requires integration of conceptually diverse information. Moreover, many different types of digital tools are necessary, ranging from basic visualization software to software that assists in the interpretation and structural annotation of glycoanalytical data (e.g., mass spectra), to algorithms that identify correlations between glycosylation and other biological phenomena (e.g., gene expression, cell differentiation, disease). A major challenge facing the glycoinformatician is the representation of the information that is processed and produced by these software tools in ways that are conceptually accessible to scientists who do not have an extensive background in glycobiology.Glycoinformatics enables the development of streamlined data reporting and sharing standards. For glycoproteins, the structures of both the glycan and the protein must be represented along with the relationship between these two entities (e.g., the identity of the glycosylation site and the fraction of the protein molecules that bear the glycan in each physiological state). To make this information relevant, the scientist often requires explicit information about the biological context (e.g., tissue and disease state) corresponding to the specified glycosylation or describing how the glycosylation changes when the tissue or cell is perturbed. The glycoscience community is building on the efforts of the Human Proteome Organization-Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to develop similar resources that describe the information that should be included when reporting experimental data, with digital data exchange formats to facilitate communication of structural and biological information and controlled vocabularies that allow the data that is exchanged to be unambiguously interpreted. For example, the Minimum Information Required for A Glycomics Experiment (MIRAGE) initiative is modeled after the well-established Minimum Information for A Proteomics Experiment (MIAPE) initiative of HUPO-PSI. These standards are required for the emergence of glycobiology as a mature discipline that is accessible to the scientific community as a whole.A major component of databases is the standardized depiction of the glycan structures. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) (see Online Appendix 1B) universal symbol nomenclature for the graphical representation of glycan structures has been developed to facilitate such standardization and is used throughout this book. Online Appendix 52A lists current databases and journal publishers that have thus far accepted or strongly recommend the use of this nomenclature. A variety of drawing software has been developed to simplify the usage of the SNFG (Online Appendix 1B). Among them, GlycanBuilder is a tool that can be used as a stand-alone, embedded in webpages, and be integrated into other programs that allow for the drawing of glycan structures. Recently, an updated version of the tool was included in the GlyGen and GlyTouCan databases providing an intuitive method for searching structural content. Built-in features provide support for the conversion of various glycan display and formats allowing users to efficiently switch between the SNFG, Oxford, hybrid, and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) symbol formats while supporting different text formats: LinearCode, KCF (KEGG Chemical Function), GlycoCT, GLYDE-II, Oxford, LINUCS, and WURCS.The Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (CCSD) (commonly referred to as CarbBank) was established in the mid-1980s. It was developed and maintained by the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center of the University of Georgia (United States). The main design objective of CCSD was to allow researchers to find publications in which specific carbohydrate structures were reported. The need to develop CarbBank as an international effort was clearly recognized and resulted in worldwide curation teams responsible for specific classes of glycans that resulted in more than 30,000 entries into the database. During the 1990s, a Dutch group (led by Hans Vliegenthart) assigned nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra to CCSD entries (SugaBase). This was the first attempt to create a carbohydrate NMR database that complemented CCSD entries with proton and carbon chemical shift values.Following the end of CCSD development in 1997, other large projects followed. Among these, the EUROCarbDB initiative (ceased in 2011) seeded integrated tools for streamlining European glycomics research through the development of databases, bioinformatics standards, analysis methods, and Web-based software components. The Australian company, Proteome Systems, provided commercial access to mammalian N- and O-glycan structures, and glycoprotein data curated from the literature, in GlycoSuiteDB. The final release of GlycoSuiteDB comprised more than 3000 glycoprotein-derived glycan structure entries and relevant metadata descriptors including taxonomy, disease, and methods of determination. This effort to provide curated information at the glycoprotein level now continues under the GlyGen and GlyConnect initiatives. In the United States, the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) was established in 2001. This project aimed to deepen understanding of the function of carbohydrate–protein interactions on the cell surface and in cell–cell communication. The CFG generated diverse data sets of (1) gene expression of glycosyltransferases and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) from gene microarray experiments, (2) phenotypic analysis of transgenic mice, (3) mass spectrometric profiling of glycan structures isolated from selected cells and tissues, and (4) glycan affinity of proteins using glycan arrays.Several large-scale initiatives to organize and integrate various glycan-related information and resources have been launched in recent years. Among these, GlyGen, GlyCosmos, and Glycomics@Expasy present integrated portals to query diverse databases related to glycomics, genomics, and proteomics. In this regard, GlyGen retrieves carbohydrate- and glycoconjugate-related data from several international data sources and integrates and harmonizes them. A user-friendly Web portal allows this information, including key associations of diverse data types, to be queried, browsed, displayed, and downloaded. GlyCosmos includes data previously collected by the Japan Consortium for Glycobiology and Glycotechnology Database (JCGGDB). This encompasses experimentally verified MS data, lectin affinity data, glycoprotein data, and glyco-gene information. For example, activity data about glycogenes such as glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotide transporters from the GlycoGene Database (GGDB) have been integrated with KEGG Orthologs and are further linked with glycan structure (GlyTouCan) and disease information (OMIM). Pathways in which glycoproteins are involved are also integrated and can be cross-searched using the main GlyCosmos search form. Glycomics@Expasy aims to host and interconnect available resources to reflect the diversity of glyco-related interactions at the cell surface. The collection is organized around GlyConnect (glycoproteins) and UniLectin (glycan-binding proteins). It also provides tools to support data interpretation such as Compozitor that maps glycomes at any level (site, protein, cell, tissue) into interactive graphs.Whereas the above resources are portals that query other data resources, additional unique, broadly useful data sets and webtools are available at Glycomics@Expasy, GLYCOSCIENCES.de, the Asian Community of Glycoscience and Glycotechnology database (ACGG), and the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) websites. Additional resources have curated non-mammalian glycan information (e.g., CSDB), lectin binding data (e.g., UniLectin, SugarBind), and enzyme data (e.g., CAZy, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG] GLYCAN). Data on the sites of addition of single O-GlcNAc to Ser/Thr on nuclear/cytoplasmic proteins is now being incorporated into the general glycoprotein databases.Table 52.1 provides a more detailed description of the currently (in 2021) active individual database resources. Note that there is no certainty that all cited databases and tools in this chapter will be active over time. Maintenance and quality of databases and software are dependent on secure, funded, and curated input which has been historically not continuous.Glycoscience databases, repositories and web portals A critical component of glycoinformatics is the availability of standardized approaches to share data and tools. To address this problem a number of international efforts are underway to establish standards for the presentation of glycomics data to facilitate data comparison, exchange, and verification. The Glycomics Ontology (GlycO) was the first ontology developed to provide standard terminologies for representing experimentally verified glycan structures as collections of chemically and contextually defined constituents, facilitating the association of these structural elements with biosynthetic and functional processes. Another effort, GlycoRDF, is a proposed standard ontology for glycan and related metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide consistent terminologies for representing glycan sequences, related biological sources, publications, and experimental data on the Semantic Web. GlycoRDF is now being used by several glycomics database providers, to enable large-scale integration of diverse data collections in the glycosciences. For example, GlyTouCan uses the GlycoRDF ontology to represent the registered data such that other data resources also using this ontology can be integrated and queried by glycan structure. Different information resources (e.g., databases and publications) can reference these identifiers, thus facilitating identification and interpretation of diverse but complementary data sets that embody information about specific glycan structures.The Semantic Web is a new technology that provides a framework for making data available directly on the Internet, provided with semantics, such that inferences can be made automatically based on the data. For example, a researcher often refers to various publications to derive a new hypothesis to test. Using the Semantic Web, the data in the publications would be formatted in such a way (using predefined vocabulary, or ontologies) that the meaning behind the data is preserved in a computable form, on the Web. Because a common vocabulary, or ontology, would be used across different publications in different websites (i.e., journals), the terminology used to encapsulate the semantics is preserved. Therefore, the Semantic Web becomes a virtual online database in which all linked data can be queried directly, without any need to transfer large amounts of data. Moreover, with such data available on the Semantic Web, machine learning technologies allow computers to make inferences based on the data available, just as a researcher would think of new hypotheses.The essential accurate interpretation of glycoanalytical data for glycan structure determination requires well-documented metadata, including the parameters used to acquire and process the raw data along with supporting biological source information for the sample being analyzed. The MIRAGE initiative was formed to develop guidelines for researchers to report the qualitative and quantitative results obtained by diverse types of glycomics analyses (e.g., chromatography, mass spectrometry, and glycan/lectin arrays).In an effort to allow glycan data to be shared seamlessly among glycan resources, GlyTouCan has been established as a stable repository and registry of chemically valid glycan structures. For each glycan, it provides unique accession numbers that are now used by diverse glycobiology data systems so that information on the glycan can be linked across databases. These unique GlyTouCan identifiers thus provide the foundation for linking glycan-related knowledge to the Semantic Web. The initial dataset of GlyTouCan structures comes from GlycomeDB, an undertaking that consolidated structures from a number of established glycan structure databases including CarbBank and provided links to the original sources. Registered users can submit any glycan structure whether they are fully defined, contain ambiguous linkages, or are simply monosaccharide compositions, independent of experimental evidence. All structures registered in GlyTouCan are checked only for representational and chemical consistency and not for biological relevance. Thus, databases that leverage GlyTouCan structural representations still require improved methods for establishing and validating the biological context of these structures. This registry facilitates the interpretation of results in the context of structural and biological information that is available from other sources. Nevertheless, the meaningful comparison of incompletely defined structures in terms of sequence, linkage, and anomericity remains an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. It should be noted that, because of the reliance on analytical structure determination, a limitation for a majority of databases is the number of fully characterized entries (i.e., defined linkages and anomeric configurations between monosaccharides). For example, less than 15,000 out of the 40,000 structures in the amalgamated GlycomeDB are fully defined.These unique identifiers, however, provide the semantic foundation required for individuals or databases to effectively communicate by recording the identifier of the structures they have characterized.Many advances in glyco-related databases and informatics tools development have focused on the interpretation and storage of analytical data, including liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), interaction arrays, mass spectrometry (MS), and three-dimensional (3D)/modeling/nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Table 52.2).Glycoinformatics data analysis software tools Most efforts so far have focused on tools that assist the interpretation of MS data. A number of commercial and publicly accessible software are now available. Introduced in 1999, the widely used GlycoMod was the first glycoinformatics Web-based tool to be released in this context, and its function is to suggest possible glycan compositions from experimental mass values of either free or derivatized glycans or glycopeptides. The Glycosciences.de portal started a toolset for analyzing and interpreting experimental data, and a decade later, the EUROCarbDB initiative launched GlycoWorkbench as a freely downloadable software tool to assist the interpretation of MS/MS data by matching a theoretical list of fragment masses against the experimental peak list derived from the mass spectrum. This tool has been integrated into several glycomics resources as it provides an easy-to-use interface, a comprehensive collection of fragmentation types, and a list of annotation options. UniCarb-DB adopts the approach of storing annotated and curated experimental glycan MS/MS data against which spectral matching can be used to identify unknown structures. RINGS provides Web-based software (Glycan Miner Tool, ProfilePSTMM) to analyze distinguishable glycan fragments from glycan profiling (MS) data, and the GlycomeAtlas tool is a visualization tool for glycan profiling data in mouse and human, where the distribution of glycans across various tissues is visualized. The GRITS toolbox is also a freely available integrated environment for processing glycoanalytic data. It uses a plug-in approach to facilitate reuse and integration of data-processing modules. GRITS includes a module called GELATO for collecting, annotating, and comparing mass spectral data, manipulating the corresponding metadata, and generating reports. This also uses libraries from GlycoWorkBench.With recent advances in high-accuracy, high-throughput mass spectrometers (Chapter 51), glycoinformatics tools have emerged (and continue to emerge and be improved) to analyze these data both for glycomics and glycoproteomics applications (Table 52.2). Despite the rapid speed of these glycoinformatics tools, the analysis may only reveal partial glycan structure information as it is challenging to determine glycosidic bond linkage type and position using MS/MS data alone, particularly in the absence of standards. To alleviate these problems in glycomics analysis, glycan spectral library data repositories have been established by various resources including NIST and UniCarb-DR, and their integration into computational programs is awaited. From the biological perspective, however, even partial information is helpful as it enables comparative glycomics analysis of different healthy and disease tissues.Similar approaches have also been undertaken in the field of glycoproteomics, in which glycoproteins and glycopeptides are analyzed in their native form, with glycans attached to them, using MS techniques (Figure 52.1; Chapter 51). Glycoproteomics not only allows the identification of the glycoprotein and the sites of the attached glycans, but can also provide some specific microheterogeneity information on the glycan compositions. Different fragmentation methods (electron transfer dissociation [ETD], collision-induced dissociation [CID], and higher-energy collision dissociation [HCD]) each provide distinct information about some different structural features of glycoproteins. More recently both stepped-energy HCD, and ETD supplementation with HCD (EThcD) have emerged as powerful strategies for revealing both the composition of the attached glycans and the sites of glycosylation. The application of multiple fragmentation modes to a single candidate glycopeptide sets the stage for the development of glycoinformatics tools that may reveal some information on the attached glycan structure (in addition to composition) at specific sites. The mass spectrum matching algorithms used in these programs vary widely (e.g., database search, de novo sequencing/open-glycan searching, or spectral library matching) to identify specific spectral fragment masses and thereby assign glycan/glycopeptide structural features. Following the ability now to obtain large data sets on glycopeptides generated from complex mixtures of glycoproteins (Chapter 51), a bottleneck that has severely limited the field of glycoproteomics is the downstream glycopeptide structural identification. The identification process was, until recently, largely driven by manual expert annotation of the resulting MS/MS spectra. However, many glycoinformatics initiatives are under continuing development to automate this glycopeptide identification process using various strategies to identify intact glycopeptides by using characteristic fragment ions. Several software tools are freely available to address the challenge of analyzing glycoproteomics data, such as pGlyco, GlycoPAT, MSFragger-Glyco, GlycReSoft, GP Finder, IQ-GPA, O-Pair, and GPQuest. Licensed Byonic and open-source Protein Prospector and MASCOT, initially designed for proteomics studies, allow semi-automated identification of N- and O-glycopeptides from high-resolution MS/MS data. The recent HUPO-HGI (Human Glycoproteomics Initiative) interlaboratory glycoproteomics analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of some of these programs, with a focus on highlighting best practices in the different approaches. Quantitation analysis can either be performed using the generic SkyLine platform or dedicated tools in the Happy-Tools collection.In comparison to MS, few software tools are available for supporting (ultra)high-performance liquid chromatography (U/HPLC) data analysis and storage. GlycoStore is a curated chromatographic and capillary electrophoretic composition database of labeled glycans (2-AB, RFMS, and 2-AA) of N-, O-, glycosphingolipid (GSL) glycans and free oligosaccharides. The database is built on publicly available experimental LC data sets from GlycoBase, which has now been commercialized. To assist analysis, GlycanAnalyzer is available for pattern-matching N-glycan LC peak shifts following exoglycosidase digestions, which can be used to assign structures to each peak. GlycoStore also provides access to CE migration data for a limited set of glycan structures.NMR data was obtained on carbohydrate structures in the 1980s and 1990s and is still the best analytical technique available to obtain complete structural information on purified oligosaccharides, but is less used now because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material from biological sources. The CASPER (Computer-Assisted Spectrum Evaluation of Regular Polysaccharides) program predicts 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of glycans. As such, it is used for determining the glycan structures based on experimental NMR data.Another area of software analysis of experimental data has been in mining glycan array data sets to identify glycan sequence motifs recognized by various GBPs, such as plant and animal lectins, viral and bacterial pathogen proteins, and antibodies. Several data analysis tools for glycan array experiments have recently emerged, including MotifFinder, GLYMMR, CCARL, Glycan Miner, Glycan Microarray Database (GlyMDB), and GLAD. Such data analysis determines the relative binding strength/specificity of a GBP to a glycan motif or determinant on the array. RINGS also has analytical tools for predicting glycan-binding patterns from glycan array data.A few databases collect information on glycan-binding proteins. The Lectin Frontier DataBase (LfDB) provides affinity data for a few hundred lectins. UniLectin, which includes the UniLectin3D collection of thousands of curated lectin 3D structures, suggests a classification based on protein folds and stores these predictions. These classes enable the definition of profiles that can be used to screen sequence databases and predict glycan-binding domains. SugarBind is a curated database of literature-derived knowledge of pathogen–glycan binding, and MatrixDB collects glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins.Because of their inherent flexibility, oligosaccharides typically exist in solution or on proteins, as an ensemble of conformations, making it a challenge to describe their 3D structure (see Chapters 30 and 50 for a description of 3D structures). Computational chemistry is an essential tool in analyzing glycan experimental data, to make predictions that may be tested experimentally, and to unravel and explain chemical processes at the atomic level.Web-based tools are available to generate a theoretical model of a carbohydrate 3D structure. A useful resource is GLYCAM-Web that provides tools for modeling oligosaccharides and glycoproteins in addition to providing downloadable structure files that can be used for molecular modeling. SWEET-II is also a carbohydrate 3D builder that is available on the GLYCOSCIENCES.de website.The two major databases for storing experimentally determined 3D carbohydrate structures are the PDB and the Cambridge Structural Database. Crystal structures of oligosaccharides are also available at Glyco3D. A recent extension of the latter is GAG-DB, centered on the 3D description of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Most of the carbohydrates in the PDB are either connected covalently to a glycoprotein or form a complex with a lectin, enzyme, or antibody. Recently, the PDB has undergone a carbohydrate remediation, ensuring that carbohydrates are accurately annotated. Therefore PDB entries now contain glycan annotations, which are available in LINUCS, GLYCAM (IUPAC-like), and WURCS formats.Despite the known sequon (NXT/S, X is not Pro) for N-linked glycosylation, many potential sites are not glycosylated in vivo, and there are no clear motif(s) for predicting O-linked glycosylation. Understanding the “rules\\'\\' of attachment site specificity for the glycosylation of proteins is thus an ongoing challenge for glycoinformaticians. Over the past 20 years, neural networks, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been implemented to predict N- or O-glycosylation and C-mannosylation. Although the original tools were hosted on the Danish CBS Prediction Servers, additional resources have emerged in the last few years.Glycoprotein informatic resources of GlyGen, GlyCosmos, and Glycomics@Expasy now provide information on the glycan structures as attached to proteins in a complementary manner. The coverage and content depend on both automated and manual efforts to mine or curate current literature that contains characterized glycan structures and their sites of attachment to proteins and on supporting data from experimental conditions and biological sources. This collaborative, international bioinformatic integration of complex molecular data from all types of glycoanalytical techniques and interactions is in constant development and is essential for the continued progress of glycobiological research.Systems biology involves the development, simulation, and analysis of biological systems (including whole-body and environmental systems) at the molecular and cellular levels. As research on glycan biosynthetic pathway simulation progresses, its integration with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics data represents the next step. This will result in a holistic understanding of biological processes (Figure 52.1), such that glycomics data can be viewed in the context of complementary data. Such integrated knowledge will result in better elucidation of the glycosylation process, reveal new interactions with GBPs, and enhance our understanding of related functional consequences.The current coordinated trend toward RDF-based data integration is already shaping future developments of glycoscience databases. It will help bridge the gap between glycomics and other -omics that have already adopted RDF ontologies but that are still very much DNA sequence–centered. Indeed, 50 years after the advent of sequencing technology, DNA sequences, along with their links to other data types (gene expression, protein structure, etc.), remain the most prominent entities in molecular biology databases and repositories. Scientists gather sequence-centered information in the course of elucidating a cellular process or a pathological behavior, simply because a gene/protein sequence is usually the common element shared across -omics domains. The problem here is that glycans are only linked to the gene via their biosynthetic enzymes and substrates. The advancement of glycoscience as a discipline depends on expanding the integration of data describing glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, lipopolysaccharides, and the genome-coded enzymatic machinery that generates or breaks down these glycans, together with the ever-increasing information about the interactions of these glycoconjugates with other components of the cell.It is the ultimate goal of glycoscience research to be able to link glycan structures with their function. Although it is still difficult to completely identify fully defined glycan structures on their conjugates in a high-throughput manner, various hypotheses regarding the relationships between the specific structure of a glycan and its biological functions have been developed. One hypothesis maintains that the structural features characteristic of a group of glycans, rather than of a single structure, are required for biological function. This hypothesis is possible but is unlikely to be valid in all cases, as many discrete glycans are known to have quite specific functions, and changing a single monosaccharide or glycosidic conformation can greatly affect their capacity to realize their functions. Thus, additional work is required to accumulate as much of the experimental glycomics data as possible into standardized formats, such that comprehensive, integrated analyses can be performed using bioinformatics technologies.The future of current endeavors in glyco-related informatics lies in the consolidation of international consortia. The small size of the glycoscience community has prompted several cooperative initiatives across all continents for representing and collecting glycomics data (as described above). To favor interactions between these complementary initiatives, the international Glycome Informatics Consortium (GLIC) was founded in 2015 to provide and maintain a centralized software resource for developers, thus enabling cooperative database and tool development. Also in 2015, a Glycomics section was established on the Swiss Institute For Bioinformatics (SIB) Expasy proteomics resource portal, and glycoprotein entries in UniProtKB have been also linked to glycan structural information, when known, in GlyGen and GlyConnect. In addition, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the Common Fund Glycoscience Program is now focused on creating new methodologies and resources to study glycans that include the development of data integration and analysis tools.In 2018, the GlySpace Alliance (glyspace.org) was formed for further standardization and collaboration between glycan database portals. This alliance consists of GlyGen, funded by the U.S. NIH Common Fund, GlyCosmos funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency–National Bioscience Database Center, and Glycomics@Expasy of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Ensuring that all data is available under a completely open license while providing the provenance of all data, sharing all data between resources, and quality-checking all data are the key goals of this alliance.These international efforts are affirmation that the importance of bioinformatics resources for glycoscience is finally being recognized, such that the role of glycans may be more easily understood and accessed by the broader research community. However it is clear that there is a long way to go before the entire community can have routine access to what aficionados of nucleic acid and protein biology currently take for granted: reliable, well-curated, user-friendly, cross-referenced databases that are permanently and safely housed in major long-term government-funded central servers. Achievement of this goal will be critical to bringing the study of glycans into the mainstream of evolutionary, molecular, and cellular biology, and its applications to medicine, materials science, and other fields that benefit humankind.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Ram Sasisekharan and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Manfred Wuhrer.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.53Peter H. Seeberger and Hermen S. Overkleeft.Pure glycans of defined structure are essential research tools in glycobiology. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, which can be obtained in homogeneous forms by recombinant expression and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, glycans produced in biological systems are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the quantities that can be obtained from biological systems are often small. Chemical synthesis can be used to obtain homogeneous glycans in larger quantities than are available from most cellular production systems. Chemical synthesis can be further employed to incorporate glycans into homogeneous glycoproteins. This chapter summarizes the current state of the art in chemical methods to produce glycans. Enzymes can be used together with chemical methods to prepare diverse glycans (Chapter 54).The structure of oligosaccharides render their synthesis more complicated than the synthesis of the other major classes of biomolecules: oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11).The choice of protecting groups and the order of protecting group installation are essential for a successful synthetic route. The most common protecting groups include benzyl ethers that stay in place through many synthetic steps (permanent protecting groups) or carbonates and esters that are removed during intermediate steps in a synthesis (temporary protecting groups). A wealth of information exists on the chemical generation of glycans and various protecting group manipulations used in the context of glycan synthesis.A glycosidic linkage is generally formed through the activation of a glycosylating agent (glycosyl donor) to create an electrophilic species that reacts with the nucleophile, for example, a hydroxyl group present on the glycosyl acceptor. Other possible acceptors include serine/threonine in the case of glycopeptides or a sphingoid in the case of glycosphingolipids. The glycosylation reaction results in the formation of either an α- or β-glycosidic linkage (see Chapter 2). A major challenge in glycan synthesis is the stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds (Figure 53.1A; Chapter 2). A variety of methods are available to stereoselectively generate glycosidic linkages. The yield and the stereochemical outcome of these reactions depend on the steric and electronic nature of the glycosylating agent (the glycosyl donor), the nature of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions. One common method to control the stereochemistry at the anomeric center involves the use of certain protecting groups, such as esters or amides/carbamates, on the C2-hydroxyl or C2-amino group (Figure 53.1B). These “participating neighboring” protecting groups can form a cyclic oxonium ion intermediate during the glycosylation reaction that shields one face of the molecule, leading exclusively to the formation of a “trans”-glycosidic linkage (i.e., where the anomeric substituent and the C2 group are on opposite sides of the ring, as in β-glucosides). The opposite anomeric stereochemistry, termed a “cis”-glycosidic bond, is more difficult to construct with high selectivity. Many different synthetic procedures have been developed for the stereoselective construction of cis-glycosidic linkages and linkages involving C2-deoxy sugars, though not as general as protecting group participation in the synthesis of trans-glycosidic linkages. The use of particular solvents/additives, remote protecting group participation, or preorganization of donor and acceptor and other methods have allowed for the stereocontrolled formation of an increasing number of cis-glycosidic linkages.(A) Stereospecific formation of glycosidic bonds as either an α- or β-linkage. (LG) Leaving group, (R) protecting group. (B) Formation of a cyclic oxonium ion intermediate leading to the formation of a β-glycosidic linkage. Carbohydrates are endowed with a wealth of functional groups. This complicates glycan synthesis, and considerable time and effort are devoted to the development of suitable protective group schemes that allow for the protection and deprotection of individual functional groups at will. Carbohydrate functional groups include hydroxyls, amines, and carboxylates, and distinguishing between these is relatively easy. Selective address of hydroxyls—the most abundant functional groups in carbohydrates—is somewhat more complicated. Primary hydroxyls and anomeric hydroxyls are relatively easy to manipulate—specifically, the former for steric reasons and the latter because they are part of a hemiacetal or hemiketal. Specific access to secondary hydroxyls requires chemistry tailored to capitalize on, for instance, their configuration (cis-hydroxyls vs. trans-hydroxyls, equatorial vs. axial) and their relative reactivity (i.e., exploiting steric and/or electronic differences). A representative protective group scheme starting from S-tolylglucopyranose (the S-tolyl group serves as both a masking group of the anomeric hydroxyl and as leaving group in glycosylation schemes) is depicted in Figure 53.2. In the first step, all hydroxyls are transformed into the corresponding trimethylsilyl ethers to render the polar carbohydrate soluble in organic solvents. Next and in a series of complementary functional group manipulations, either O-2 (A), O-4 (B), or O-6 (C) is selectively liberated. In all instances, the first step comprises creation of the 4,6-O-benzylidene species. Reductive benzylation of O-3 followed by benzoylation of O-2 and reductive opening of the benzylidene toward the O-4-benzyl delivers glucose building block C. Alternative reductive opening of the benzylidene toward the O-6-benzyl delivers B, whereas leaving the benzylidene intact and removal of any remaining silyl protective groups delivers glucoside A.Protective group manipulations, which can be carried out in one-pot procedures, toward a series of glucopyranose-derived building blocks for glycan assembly. In the synthesis of a fragment of a putative repeating unit of the exopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 53.3) the interplay between protective group pattern and glycosylation strategies becomes apparent. Glycosylation of 4,6-O-benzylidene protected thiomannoside 1 with orthogonally protected fucoside 2 promoted by benzenesulfinylpiperidine (BSP) and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) affords disaccharide 3. The stereoselective creation of the β-mannosidic linkage follows a SN2 displacement of an intermediate anomeric α-triflate stabilized by the benzylidene moiety.Solution phase synthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa–derived decasaccharide 10. Oxidative removal of the naphthyl (Nap) protecting group and glycosylation with mannoside 4 gives trisaccharide 5. The anomeric allyl (All) group on the reducing fucoside is removed and transformed into the glycosyl trichloroacetimidate, which is condensed with the 3-hydroxyl group of orthogonally protected glucoside 6 to give tetrasaccharide 7. A 2-O-benzoyl (Bz) participating group in fucose building block 2 ensures the 1,2-trans-configuration. Elaboration of tetrasaccharide 7 led to fully protected decasaccharide 10 and illustrates the need for the two differently protected building blocks 1 and 4. The benzyl (Bn) protective protecting group in 1 serves as a permanent protecting group destined for removal at the final stages of the synthesis. In contrast, The tertbutyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group in 4 can be removed selectively during the synthesis. The 2-hydroxyl groups in mannose residues are liberated and 1,2-trans (α) mannosylated with building block 8. Global deprotection of 9 is effected in two steps: base treatment to remove acyl protective groups followed by catalytic hydrogenation to simultaneously remove benzyl, naphthyl, and benzylidene groups. The azide at the reducing end spacer is transformed into the amine for neoglycoprotein synthesis for immunization studies, or to produce glycan arrays.Automated solid-phase synthesis has made great impact on peptide/protein and nucleic acid chemistry and biology. This development in synthetic chemistry made peptides and oligonucleotides available to biologists and facilitated studies of biopolymer structure and function. Likewise, the availability of a general automated (solid-phase) method for glycan synthesis vastly accelerates access to homogeneous material for biological studies. Because oligosaccharide synthesis is much more complex than the assembly of oligopeptides and nucleotides, automated procedures for glycan assembly were slower to evolve, but automated synthesizers are now commercially available. A prerequisite in automated glycan assembly (AGA) is full control over the stereochemistry of a newly formed glycosidic linkage. AGA is based on monosaccharide building blocks with orthogonal protecting groups and a linker. Important added value of AGA is the ability to rapidly generate libraries of related but distinct glycans, and the ability to prepare polysaccharides of a size not easily accessible with other methods.The synthesis of a 100-mer polymannoside commences with placing a polystyrene Merrifield resin equipped with a photo-cleavable linker 11 in the reaction vessel of an automated synthesizer. Mannose thioglycoside building block 12 is employed for AGA using a four-step cycle (Figure 53.4A). The incorporation of each monomer relies on an acidic washing step to prevent quenching by any remaining base, followed by the coupling step using 5-6.5 equivalents of building block 12. Next, a capping step prevents any unreacted nucleophiles from engaging in subsequent couplings to produce (n-1)-polysaccharides that are difficult to separate from the desired product. Removal of the temporary Fmoc protecting group exposes the nucleophile for the subsequent coupling step. The 100 coupling cycles were executed automatically within 188 hours and yielded 100-mer α-(1-6) polymannoside 13 after photo-cleavage from the resin and normal-phase HPLC purification (8% overall yield). Cleavage of all ester protective groups by treatment with sodium methoxide, followed by palladium catalyzed hydrogenolysis under pressure to release all benzyl ether protective groups produced 100-mer polymannoside 14 after preparative reverse-phase HPLC.(A) Schematic overview of automated glycan assembly. (B) Automated glycan assembly (AGA) of 100-polymannoside 14. (C) AGA of an alginate dodecasaccharide. The synthesis of an alginate dodecamer composed of the β-1,4-mannuronate moieties is of note because it required the repetitive installation of cis-glycosidic linkages. The synthesis makes use of immobilized allyl alcohol 15. Reaction with donor mannuronic ester 16 under catalytic amounts of triflic acid (TfOH) yields immobilized monosaccharide 17. Removal of the levulinoyl (Lev) group at O-4 is accomplished by treatment with hydrazine (H2N-NH2) monoacetate, after which the coupling-deprotection sequence is repeated for the desired number of times. Upon completion of the glycan assembly, the fully protected oligosaccharide is removed from the solid support by cross metathesis and subsequent removal of all protecting groups by treatment with strong base and hydrogenolysis.More complex polysaccharides are accessible by block couplings of polysaccharides prepared by AGA. Two polysaccharide blocks, linear 30-mer α-(1-6) polymannoside 21 prepared by AGA from mannose building block 12 and branched 31-mer polymannoside 23 prepared by AGA using 12 and differentially protected mannose building block 22 for the branching positions were unified in a 31+30+30+30+30 coupling to create branched 151-mer 24 that was deprotected to furnish 25 (Figure 53.5).Synthesis of a 151-mer polymannoside by block coupling of polymannosides prepared by automated glycan assembly (AGA). A database of relative reactivity values (RRVs a number indicating how reactive a glycosyl donor is) of thioglycoside donors has been used to design one-pot glycosylation sequences. Several thioglycosides are combined and selective activation of one of the building blocks over the others can be achieved. The Optimer computer program aids in the selection of the combination of building blocks, equipped with the proper set of protecting groups that tune the reactivity. Figure 53.6 shows the one-pot assembly of the tumor associated N3 antigen octasaccharide using the Optimer approach. Three building blocks were designed and synthesized: fucosyl donor 26 (RRV = 7.2 × 104), lactosamine donor 27 (RRV = 41), and lactose building block 28 (RRV = 0). The latter disaccharides were prepared by chemoselective glycosylations exploiting RRVs. Combination of the first two building blocks in a BSP/Tf2O mediated condensation gave the trisaccharide thioglycoside. Addition of lactose 28 to the reaction vessel and NIS/TfOH to promote the ensuing double glycosylation provided the octasaccharide 29. After deprotection the spacer functionalized octasaccharide 30 was obtained in 11% yield.One-pot synthesis of octasaccharide antigen 32. Over the past quarter century, the chemical synthesis of glycans has advanced from an art practiced by synthetic chemists that engaged in heroic total synthesis efforts to a routine task for glycans that contain common monomeric constituents and trans-glycosidic linkages. With the commercialization of AGA in which a set of common building blocks is combined on a solid phase resin, the synthesis process can be greatly accelerated. AGA has become an important part of carbohydrate synthesis as polysaccharides as long as 100-mers as well as glycosaminoglycans are now rapidly accessible in multimilligram quantities. The production of highly branched structures will become routine in the coming years. Still, for challenging targets, containing rare monosaccharides and 2-deoxy and 1,2-cis-linkages, improved methods for solution phase synthesis will have to be developed. These methods will greatly benefit from the advances in fundamental knowledge on the glycosylation reaction and will be aided by knowledge gathered in databases. In addition, enzymatic synthesis and combinations of chemical and enzymatic synthesis are important assets to procure large quantities of glycans.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Nathaniel Finney and David Rabuka and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Martina Delbianco.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Seeberger.Glycosyltransferases are the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the construction of interglycosidic linkages and glycosidases catalyze the opposite reaction, hydrolysis of interglycosidic linkages. The diversity of natural glycans is reflected by the numerous glycosyltransferases and glycosidases encountered in nature, each exhibiting a defined substrate specificity. Natural glycans are often encountered in heterogeneous form and often produced in minute amounts making their isolation and characterization from natural sources often cumbersome. Therefore, glycobiology relies heavily on synthetic glycans, and synthetic methodology to produce glycans has witnessed tremendous progress (see Chapter 53). Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases offer advantages in the construction of glycans as these biocatalysts are very powerful under controlled conditions. This chapter summarizes recent developments in the use of (mutant) glycosidases and glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of tailored glycans, including combinations of both enzyme classes and in conjunction with chemically synthesized intermediates are presented.The mechanism of action of glycosyltransferases resembles the way an interglycosidic linkage is installed by chemical synthesis (Chapter 53). An activated donor saccharide, represented by UDP-glucose (Figure 54.1) is condensed with an acceptor moiety (here, ceramide) to give, after expulsion of the leaving group (here, UDP), the glycoconjugate (glucosylceramide). In contrast to chemical synthesis, the regioselectivity is regulated by the enzyme active site that also selects for the donor and the acceptor. The glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed synthesis of glucosylceramide (Figure 54.1) proceeds with “inversion” of the anomeric configuration, with the α-glucosidic linkage in UDP-glucose transformed into the β-glucosidic linkage in glucosylceramide. Nature employs a limited set of donor glycosides—most prominently the sugar nucleotides for Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, next to UDP-glucose for instance CMP-sialic acid, GDP-mannose—and the nature of the glycosyltransferase determines whether glycosylation proceeds with “retention” or “inversion” of configuration at the anomeric center. The mechanisms employed by most Leloir glycosyltransferases are now resolved.Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide. (GCS) Glucosylceramide synthase, (UDP) uridine diphosphate glucose, (GBA) acid glucosylceramidase. Glucosylceramide is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal exo-glucosidase, acid glucosylceramidase (GBA). Hydrolysis takes place with “retention of configuration” and is the result of a double displacement mechanism. Upon protonation of the aglycon, ceramide is displaced in an SN2 substitution–like process to yield a covalent enzyme-glycoside adduct. Upon entry of water in the enzyme active site, the formed glycosyl linkage is hydrolyzed in another SN2-like process to release glucose from the enzyme active site. Next to retention of configuration, the hydrolysis of interglycosidic bonds can also take place with “inversion of configuration” and is normally the result of an SN2 displacement–like process of a protonated aglycon by water. Although not necessarily relevant for the product formation in nature (sugar hemiacetals being prone to mutarotation at physiological pH), the different mechanisms employed by “retaining glycosidases” (involvement of a covalent intermediate) and “inverting glycosidases” (no covalent intermediate involved) bears consequences for their use in glycan synthesis.The use of Leloir-type glycosyltransferases in glycan synthesis requires access to the natural donor glycosides, which are sugar nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic advantage of glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis (excellent regio- and stereoselectivity) can be offset by the limitation on the access to the required donor glycosides. However, this challenge may be overcome by in situ biosynthesis/regeneration of the consumed sugar nucleotides. The power of glycosyltransferase-mediated glycan synthesis was demonstrated in 1992 by the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x derivative 5 (Figure 54.2). Allyl lactoside 2, derived by chemical synthesis (see Chapter 53), is reacted with CMP-sialic acid 1 using a recombinant α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-SiaT) as the catalyst. The resulting trisaccharide 3 is further extended with GDP-fucose 4 as the donor and recombinant fucosyltransferase (FucT) as the catalyst to deliver allyl sialyl-Lewis x.Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x. (CMP) Cytidine monophosphate, (CDP) cytidine diphosphate, (CTP) cytidine triphosphate. In the first step of the assembly line, the expensive sugar nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, is consumed, and on transfer of the sialic acid, cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is produced. With the aid of two consecutive kinases (nucleoside monophosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase), CMP can be transformed in situ into the corresponding triphosphate (CTP), which is then condensed by the enzyme CMP-sialic acid synthetase with sialic acid to regenerate CMP-Neu5Ac 2.Glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of ganglio-oligosaccharides. The synthesis of GalNAc-GD1a heptasaccharide 7 equipped with a biotin at the reducing end (replacing the sphingolipids present in the natural product) was accomplished by submitting synthetic lactoside 6 to the consecutive action of four glycosyltransferases, one of which (α-2,3-SiaT) was employed twice (Figure 54.3). By using this method with various donor sugar nucleotides and glycosyltransferases, a comprehensive series of glycosphingolipid glycans and their analogs have been obtained. The methodology, especially with respect to enzymatic sialic acid introduction, is competitive when compared to chemical gangliosides synthesis.Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of mammalian N-glycans. The synthesis of complex, asymmetrically branched mammalian N-glycans was accomplished using combined chemical and glycosyltransferase-mediated enzymatic synthesis. As an example, decasaccharide 8 was prepared via contemporary solution phase chemical oligosaccharide synthesis (see Chapter 53). The asymmetrically branched decasaccharide features two nonreducing galactopyranose moieties, one of which is introduced as the tetra-acetate (in bold) whereas the other is unprotected. Decasaccharide 8 is thus designed to allow for specific enzymatic sialylation of the unprotected galactose residue (Figure 54.4). After saponification, the intermediate undecasaccharide is expanded to well-defined oligosaccharide 9 making use of the substrate specificity of α-1,3-fucosyltransferase (α-1,3-FucT, introduction of two fucopyranoses), β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β-1,4-GalT, twice), β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminetransferase (β-1,3-GlcNAcT), and finally the sialyltransferase, ST6Gal-I. The chemoenzymatic strategy proved flexible and allowed for the generation of diverse N-glycans in which the reducing end is available for bioconjugation and for the preparation of glycan microarrays for protein binding studies.In contrast to glycosyltransferase-mediated reactions, in which the equilibrium is shifted predominantly to (natural) product formation because of the intrinsic reactivity of donor glycosides, the equilibrium in a glycosidase-mediated reaction can be influenced such that the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction.Under physiological conditions, with high water concentrations, glycosidases hydrolyze glycosidic linkages to produce the corresponding hemiacetal, either with retention (Figure 54.5A) or inversion of configuration at the anomeric center. Performing a glycosidase reaction in partly nonaqueous conditions, by addition of large excess of aglycon, by inducing kinetic conditions or by a combination of these allows for partial reversal of the reaction equilibrium. By this means and in a “transglycosylation” event, glycans can be constructed. Disadvantages of this method are that reaction conditions may be adverse to enzyme reactivity and/or stability and, moreover, that the formed product is in essence a substrate for glycosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis. This caveat can be circumvented by making use of mutant glycosidases (Figure 54.5B) in which the catalytic nucleophile in case of retaining glycosidases is mutated to an innocent bystander (depicted is an Asp to Ala substitution). Such a “glycosynthase” can be used to react a synthetic donor glycoside that bears the anomeric configuration corresponding to the intermediate enzyme glycosyl covalent adduct (see Figure 54.1) with an appropriate nucleophile to construct a desired glycosidic linkage. The main advantage of this strategy is that, in principle, the mutant glycosidase has largely lost the ability to hydrolyze the formed product, because of the absence of the catalytic nucleophile. Many retaining glycosidases and, in recent years, inverting glycosidases have been mutated to glycosynthases, which have been used to produce a diverse array of glycans.(A) Equilibrium in a retaining β-glucosidase. (B) Mutant-retaining β-glucosidase in which the catalytic nucleophile is substituted for a nonparticipating amino acid allows for the construction of β-glucosides. The strategy is exemplified by the synthesis of flavonoid glucoside 13 (Figure 54.6). Synthetic α-fluorolactoside 10 is treated with phenol 11 in the presence of the E197S mutant of the Humicola insolens Cel7B endoglucosidase. This glycosynthase proved highly flexible with respect to the acceptor phenol, allowing for the construction of a small library of flavonoid glycosides represented by phenolic disaccharide 12. Subsequent enzymatic removal of the nonreducing galactospyranoside provided flavonoid glucoside 13.Glycosynthase-mediated synthesis of flavonoid glycosides. By combining the strengths of glycosyltransferases, glycosynthases, and chemical synthesis, the total synthesis of ganglioside LLG-3 from the neurogenic starfish was accomplished (Figure 54.7). N-Carboxybenzyl(Cbz)-protected CMP-sialic acid 17 was prepared by first performing a Neu5Ac aldolase-catalyzed aldol reaction of mannosamine derivative 14 and pyruvate 15. The resulting sialic acid derivative 16 was reacted with CTP under the agency of CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase to give donor sialoside 17. In a sialyltransferase-catalyzed reaction, compound 17 was condensed with α-fluorolactoside 10 to give trisaccharide 18, in which the amine was unmasked by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis to give trisaccharide, equipped with an anomeric fluoride for glycosynthesis and an amine for chemical amide bond formation. The sequence commenced by condensation of synthetic sialic acid derivative 20 with the free amine in 19 under amide bond-forming conditions, to give 21. Condensation of tetrasaccharidyl fluoride 21 with the double (E351S/D341Y) mutant of the bacterial endoglycosidase EGCase II gave lysolipid 23 in good yield. The free amine in 23 can be condensed with a fatty acid or alternatively with a fluorescent reporter group.A combined glycosyltransferase/glycosynthase/chemical synthesis of a lysosphingolipid. Glycosynthases derived from endoglycosidases have been used for the construction of structurally well-defined N-glycoproteins (Figure 54.8). Hexosaminidases, both exo- and endo-types, hydrolyze N-acetylglucosamine-containing glycosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric configuration. In contrast to most other retaining glycosidases, some retaining hexosaminidases do not employ an enzyme active site nucleophile in the nucleophilic displacement of the aglycon, but rather utilize the N-acetyl group in the substrate for this purpose (Figure 54.8, insert). As a result, an intermediate oxazolinium ion intermediate is produced that after nucleophilic attack of water yields the hemiacetal with retention of configuration. Endo-hexosaminidases can be employed in transglycosylation reactions and, in mutant form, as glycosynthases.Glycosynthase mediated synthesis of homogeneous peptide N-glycans. A demonstration of an endo-hexosaminidase-derived glycosynthase in action is given by the synthesis of Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptide 28 from a glycoprotein from HIV-1. The sequence of steps commences with homogeneous Man9GlcNAc2Asn 24 that can be prepared by exhaustive proteolytic digestion of soybean glycoproteins by pronase. Wild-type endohexosaminidase, Endo-A, recognizes this high-mannose N-glycan and hydrolyses the GlcNAc-GlcNAc glycosidic linkage, to yield Man9GlcNAc 25. After peracetylation, treatment with trimethylsilyl bromide and borontrifluoride etherate, and global deprotection provided oxazolidinium ion 27. This compound is a good substrate for mutant (N175A) endohexosaminidase, endo-M, which was identified by site-directed mutagenesis as a putative glycosynthase activity. In the final step, the efficacy of the endo-M glycosynthase was demonstrated by the construction of high-mannose N-glycan 28 from 26 and 27.Enzymatic synthesis has proven to be a powerful methodology for the construction of complex glycans. Chemoenzymatic synthesis can be a suitable alternative for chemical synthesis, as demonstrated by the many applications of sialyltransferases for the construction of complicated or intractable sialic acid-containing glycans. The marriage of enzymatic synthesis and chemical synthesis is very promising. The elaboration by means of glycosyltransferases and/or glycosynthases has proven to be a highly effective strategy to prepare large and complex glycans and glycoconjugates. Advances in chemical and enzymatic syntheses provide the means to construct most natural or designed glycans.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Nathaniel Finney and David Rabuka and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Xi Chen.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Esko.The use of chemical tools to inhibit glycosylation is a powerful approach for studying glycan functions and can serve as a starting point for drug discovery. This chapter discusses various types of inhibitors including those present in nature, those identified through rational design followed by synthesis, and those found by screening of chemical libraries.Chapters 44, 45, and 49 describe natural and induced mutants with defects in glycosylation. These mutants have helped to define genes that encode various transferases and glycosidases, and in some cases alternate biosynthetic pathways have been uncovered. Mutants also provide insights into the function of glycosylation in cells and tissues and models for human inborn errors in metabolism and disease. However, one limitation of studying mutants is that the analyses are usually restricted to the cell or organism from which the mutant strain was isolated, and mutations in essential genes require conditional alleles.Inhibitors of carbohydrate-processing enzymes—in particular, glycosyltransferases and glycosidases—provide another approach for studying glycosylation in cells, tissues, and whole organisms that avoids some of the problems associated with genetic models. Many of these compounds are small molecules that are taken up readily by cells and the effects can be reversed, enabling experimental designs that are difficult to achieve using genetic methods. Some compounds can also be absorbed through the gut, providing an opportunity for designing drugs to treat human diseases and disorders correlated with altered glycosylation (Chapter 57). Because the field is broad, only a selection of inhibitors that act on specific enzymes or metabolic pathways and that illustrate certain basic concepts are discussed here (Figure 55.1).Different classes of compounds for inhibiting glycosylation including those that prevent the formation of biosynthetic precursors, those that directly act on glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, and those that serve as primers/decoys and chain terminators. (more...)A number of inhibitors have been described that block glycosylation by interfering with the metabolism of common precursors or intracellular transport activities. Some of these compounds act indirectly by impeding the transit of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and trans-Golgi network. For example, brefeldin A (Figure 55.1) causes retrograde transport of Golgi components located proximal to the trans-Golgi network back to the ER. Thus, treating cells with brefeldin A separates enzymes located in the trans-Golgi network from those found in the ER and Golgi and uncouples the assembly of the core structures of some glycans from later reactions, such as sialylation or sulfation. The drug can be used to examine if two pathways reside in the same compartment or share enzymes. Because the localization and array of the enzymes vary considerably in different cell types, extrapolating the effects of brefeldin A from one system to another is often difficult.Some inhibitors act at key steps in intermediary metabolism in which glycosylation precursors are formed. For example, a glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON; Figure 55.1) blocks many glutamine-dependent amidotransferases including glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, the enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that forms glucosamine from fructose and glutamine (Chapter 5). Depressing glucosamine production in this way has a pleiotropic effect on glycan assembly because all of the major families contain N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine. Given the nonspecific activity of DON, care should be taken to understand and limit nonspecific side effects.An array of sugar analogs have been made with the hope that they might show selective inhibition of glycosylation. Some examples include 2-deoxy-D-glucose and fluorosugar analogs (3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-glucosamine, 4-deoxy-4-fluoro-D-glucosamine, 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-D-N-acetylglucosamine, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-fucose, and 3-fluorosialic acid), which all inhibit glycoprotein biosynthesis (Figure 55.1). Early studies with 2-deoxyglucose showed that the analog was converted to UDP-2-deoxyglucose, as well as to GDP-2-deoxyglucose and dolichol-P-2-deoxyglucose. Inhibition of glycoprotein formation apparently occurs as a result of accumulation of various dolichol oligosaccharides containing 2-deoxyglucose, which cannot be elongated or transferred to glycoproteins normally. Although the mechanism of action of many of these molecules remains poorly understood, one better studied case is 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-fucose (Figure 55.1). This compound acts as a biosynthetic precursor of the fucose salvage pathway (Chapter 5) to form GDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-fucose within cells, but the analog is a poor substrate for mammalian fucosyltransferases because the highly electronegative fluorine atom close to the anomeric center inductively stabilizes the oxocarbenium ion-like transition states used by the superfamily of glycosyltransferases (Chapter 6). This compound also causes feedback inhibition of the GDP-fucose biosynthetic enzyme GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) leading to a loss of natural GDP-fucose within cells and a consequent decrease in the levels of fucosylation on all types of glycoconjugates. Notably, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-fucose is orally available and is active both in vitro on cells as well as in vivo, leading to decreases in the levels of the carbohydrate epitope sialyl-Lewis x (sLex) (Chapter 14). Consistent with these effects, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-fucose has shown potential, in preclinical models, at blocking tumor growth and metastasis as well as vaso-occlusive crisis caused by sLex-mediated adhesion of blood cells to selectin-expressing endothelial surfaces (Chapter 34) in transgenic sickle-cell mice. Similarly, 3-fluorosialic acid is converted by the NeuAc-salvage pathway (Chapter 5) within cells into CMP-3F-NeuAc and blocks formation of CMP-NeuAc, leading to profound decreases in sialylation of glycoconjugates both in cells and in vivo, suggesting potential use in cancers. Other sugar analogs, including 5-thio-N-acetylglucosamine and 4-deoxy-4-fluoro-N-acetylglucosamine, also lead to formation of unnatural donor sugars formed within cells that reduce pools of the natural nucleotide sugars and lead to consequent decreases in protein glycosylation. These compounds are proving useful research tools; however, care must be taken in interpreting the results of experiments using these compounds because they may have pleiotropic effects on glycan assembly caused by overlap of nucleotide precursors in different pathways.A number of natural products have been found to alter glycosylation. Tunicamycin belongs to a class of nucleoside antibiotics composed of uridine, an 11-carbon disaccharide called 2-amino-2,6,-dideoxyundecodialdose (tunicamine), and a fatty acid of variable length (13 to 17 carbons), branching, and unsaturation (Figure 55.1). Tunicamycin derives its name from its antiviral activity, which occurs by inhibiting viral coat (or “tunica”) formation. The biosynthesis of tunicamycin has been defined, which may lead to analogs that are selective for different species.Tunicamycin inhibits N-glycosylation in eukaryotes by blocking the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P (catalyzed by GlcNAc phosphotransferase; GPT), thereby decreasing the formation of dolichol-PP-GlcNAc (Chapter 9). Other GlcNAc transferase reactions are not inhibited (e.g., GlcNAcTI–V), but the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to undecaprenyl-P and the formation of undecaprenyl-PP-MurNAc pentapeptide (which is involved in bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis) are sensitive to tunicamycin (Chapter 21). The compound is a tight-binding competitive inhibitor, presumably because it resembles the donor nucleotide sugar. The Ki value for tunicamycin is ∼5×10−8m, whereas the Km value for UDP-GlcNAc is ∼3×10−6m. Given the key role of N-glycosylation in protein folding and quality control in the ER (Chapter 39), tunicamycin is cytotoxic to cells, and resistant mutants overproduce GPT. Similarly, transfection of cells with the cloned GPT confers resistance, suggesting that the variable dose of inhibitor required in different cells may reflect variation in enzyme levels. A more recently identified compound, NGI-1, offers an approach to blocking N-glycosylation that is complementary to use of tunicamycin. This compound acts as a direct inhibitor of oligosaccharyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for transferring the dolichol-PP-loaded glycan to asparagine.Tunicamycin has been used extensively for studying the role of N-glycans in glycoprotein maturation, secretion, and function. The drug induces apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells, presumably because of alterations in glycosylation of various cell-surface receptors and signaling molecules and by inducing ER stress (Chapter 39). Thus, inhibition of N-glycan formation could be useful for treating cancer patients. Other potential applications include substrate reduction therapy for treatment of lysosomal storage disorders (Chapter 44), congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45), or naturally occurring mutations that create N-glycosylation sites in cell-surface receptors (gain-of-glycosylation mutants; Chapter 45). In a related vein, amphomycin, a lipopeptide, inhibits dolichol-P-mannose synthesis by apparently forming complexes with the carrier lipid dolichol-P. Other lipophilic compounds that bind lipid intermediates in bacterial cell wall synthesis also have been studied (Chapter 21).Many different inhibitors of enzymes involved in glycoside formation or cleavage have been described, spanning a wide range of compound classes. These include natural products and synthetic derivatives, as well as acceptor and donor analogs obtained by chemical synthesis. The high-throughput screening of compound libraries and subsequent optimization of hits using medicinal chemistry approaches has also led to compounds that are both useful chemical tools and drugs. In this section, we highlight a few examples.Plant alkaloids block N-linked glycosylation by inhibiting the processing glycosidases (α-glucosidases and α-mannosidases) involved in trimming nascent chains (Figure 55.2). Unlike tunicamycin, which blocks glycosylation of glycoproteins entirely, these alkaloids inhibit the trimming reactions that occur after the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide is attached to a glycoprotein (Chapter 9). Treatment of cells with alkaloids results in the display of glycoproteins on the cell surface lacking the characteristic termini found on mature N-glycans (Chapter 14). α-Glucosidase inhibitors involved in the initial processing of N-glycans and in quality control of protein folding (Chapter 39) include castanospermine (from the seed of the Australian chestnut tree, Castanosperum australe), which inhibits α-glucosidases I and II, australine (also from C. australe), which preferentially inhibits α-glucosidase I, and deoxynojirimycin (from Streptomyces species), which preferentially inhibits α-glucosidase II (Figure 55.2). Castanospermine and australine cause accumulation of fully glucosylated chains, whereas deoxynojirimycin results in chains containing one to two glucose residues. Unexpectedly, treating cells with these inhibitors revealed that some trimming of the mannose residues occurs independently of removal of the glucose residues through the action of the mechanistically intriguing GH99 endo-mannosidase (Chapter 9).Examples of alkaloids that inhibit glycosidases involved in N-linked glycan biosynthesis. Swainsonine was first discovered in plants from the western United States (Astragalus species, also known as locoweed) and Australia (Swainsona canescens). Consumption of these plants by animals causes a severe abnormality called locoism and accumulation of glycoproteins in the lymph nodes. Swainsonine inhibits α-mannosidase II, causing accumulation of paucimannose oligosaccharides (Man4GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2) and hybrid-type chains at the expense of complex oligosaccharides. In addition, swainsonine inhibits the lysosomal α-mannosidase. Mannostatin A works in a similar way, but differs significantly in structure from swainsonine (Figure 55.2). Other mannosidase inhibitors include deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensin, which selectively inhibit α-mannosidase I. These agents cause the accumulation of Man7–9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides on glycoproteins.All of the above listed inhibitors have in common polyhydroxylated ring systems that mimic the orientation of hydroxyl groups in the natural substrates, but a strict correlation between stereochemistry and enzyme target (α-glucosidase vs. α-mannosidase) does not exist. The compounds contain nitrogen, usually in place of the ring oxygen. To explain their activity, it is proposed that the nitrogen, which is protonated at physiological pH, mimics the transition state during the hydrolysis reaction, which has substantial positive character. Crystal structures for the α-mannosidase are available with a range of different bound inhibitors.Diastereomers as well as alkylated and acylated analogs of the alkaloids have interesting and useful properties. Notably, the galactose-configured analog of deoxynojirimycin (Galafold; Figure 55.1) has been approved as a pharmacological chaperone of the lysosomal α-galactosidase for the treatment of the lysosomal storage disease known as Fabry disease (Chapter 44). Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme generally impair its ability to fold and traffic from the ER to lysosomes. Galafold can bind to the mutant α-galactosidase in the ER and help it fold and avoid degradation leading to its improved trafficking and activity within lysosomes. N-Butylation of deoxynojirimycin makes this glucosidase inhibitor an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis, which is discussed in more detail further below. In other cases, alkylation of the amino group or acylation of the hydroxyl groups can improve the potency of the compound, presumably by facilitating uptake across the plasma and Golgi membranes. Some of these compounds have shown positive effects for treating diabetes, cancer, HIV infection, and lysosomal storage diseases (see Chapter 57), but some also induce male sterility. A major challenge with all of these enzymes is their limited specificity; thus while convenient and widely used, some caution is needed when interpreting resulting observations.The importance of O-GlcNAc addition to many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Chapter 19) has stimulated interest in developing agents to inhibit its addition by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or its removal by O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase [OGA]). These enzymes provide excellent examples of successful rational design and medicinal chemistry efforts directed to the development of glycoside hydrolase and glycosyltransferase inhibitors. Alloxan and streptozotocin affect O-GlcNAc addition, but these compounds lack specificity. The first potentially useful OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1; Figure 55.3) was obtained by screening chemical libraries for compounds that displaced a fluorescent derivative of the donor sugar, UDP-GlcNAc. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry led to quinoline-containing ester (OSMI-4), which is a high-quality OGT inhibitor that is effective in cells. The active compounds do not block other N-acetylglucosamine addition reactions—for example, one involved in formation of the polysaccharide backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan (Chapter 21). In addition, 5SGlcNAc is another inhibitor of OGT that acts as a metabolic precursor leading to formation of UDP-5SGlcNAc. Its peracetylated form (Ac-5SGlcNAc) crosses cell membranes and undergoes deacetylation by nonspecific esterases to generate cell-active inhibitors. Modification of the N-acetyl group to give S5GlcNHex eliminated the need to have O-acetylation and provided a compound that could be used in vivo, although, like other metabolic precursor inhibitors, their use requires care because of possible off-target effects on other enzymes (e.g., GlcNAc transferases [Chapter 9]).Inhibitors of O-GlcNAc-specific β-glucosaminidase (OGA) and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Several O-GlcNAcase inhibitors are based on N-acetylglucosamine. The first described, PUGNAc (Figure 55.3) inhibits O-GlcNAcase at nanomolar concentrations, but also inhibits lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (HexA and HexB; Chapter 44). 1,2-Dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NButGT) and the more potent aminothiazoline Thiamet-G are more specific and potent in cells than PUGNAc (Figure 55.3). A rationally designed glucoimidazole, GlcNAcstatin, also potently inhibits O-GlcNAcase with good selectivity over HexA and HexB. These compounds inhibit the enzyme in cells and tissues, and Thiamet-G, in particular, has been used in animal models, providing new tools to study the function of O-GlcNAc. Use of these compounds has uncovered the potential of O-GlcNAcase inhibitors in various neurodegenerative diseases, which has spurred industrial pharmaceutical interest that has led to OGA inhibitors, such as the Thiamet-G analog MK-8719 (Figure 55.3), advancing into Phase I clinical trials. Noncarbohydrate O-GlcNAcase inhibitors have also been uncovered, and highly potent brain permeable analogs have been used as positron emission tomography agents to examine the inhibition and distribution of O-GlcNAcase in human brain.A number of specific glycosyltransferase inhibitors have been developed based on the concept that donor and acceptor substrate analogs might serve as inhibitors. For acceptor substrate analogs, the general strategy is to modify the hydroxyl group that acts as the nucleophile during formation of the glycosidic bond or groups in its immediate vicinity (Table 55.1). Many designer compounds lack inhibitory activity, because modification of the targeted hydroxyl group prevents binding of the analog to the enzyme by interfering with hydrogen bonding networks that position the substrate; that is, these groups serve as “key polar groups.” In a smaller number of cases, the analogs show Ki values in the approximate range of the Km values for the unmodified substrate. As one might expect, the analogs usually act competitively with respect to the unmodified substrate, but in a few cases the inhibition pattern is more complex, suggesting possible binding outside the active site.Synthetic substrate-based inhibitors of glycosyltransferases Nucleotide sugar analogs provide opportunities for blocking classes of enzymes that use a common donor (e.g., all fucosyltransferases use GDP-fucose). Many nucleotide sugar derivatives have been synthesized (e.g., N- and O-substituted analogs of UDP-GalNAc), and several inhibit the enzymes in vitro. These have proven less useful in living cells because of poor uptake, but there are some notable exceptions, including the fluorescently tagged CMP-NeuAc analog in which the carbohydrate is replaced with an aryl group (1-G-m, Figure 55.1), which has a nanomolar Ki values for a range of sialyltransferases. This compound has also been reported to block sialyltransferases within cells, although this compound has not been more widely adopted by the community. “Bisubstrate” transition-state analogs consist of the nucleoside sugar donor covalently linked to the acceptor substrate by way of a bridging group. In principle, this approach could lead to high-affinity inhibitors, in turn justifying the usually complex routes needed for their synthesis. However, the compounds reported to date have been only modest inhibitors with Ki values, at best, in the range of the Km values for the donors. Although such transition state mimics remain attractive targets, the results to date suggest new features need to be incorporated into their design.Reagents that alter the assembly of glycolipids in cells have been described. Xylosides (Figure 55.1) have a mild effect on glycolipid formation, possibly because of the similarity between xylose and glucose and the assembly of a GM3-like compound (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Xylβ-O-R) on the primer. Because cells take up intermediates in glycolipid biosynthesis, they behave like synthetic glycoside primers. For example, glucosylceramide produces complex glycolipids when fed to cells. More direct competitive inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) have been generated with a view to their potential benefit in Gaucher disease (Chapter 44), which stems from accumulation of glucosylceramide caused by loss-of-function mutations in β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). D-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (D-PDMP; Figure 55.4) has been a widely used compound; however, it also inhibits the activity of purified lactosylceramide synthase. Medicinal chemistry efforts have led to the close analog eliglustat, which although it does not gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), is approved for treating type I Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder in which glucocerebrosidase is missing (Chapter 44). Its beneficial activity occurs through “substrate deprivation” by blocking synthesis of glycosphingolipids, thereby “depriving” the lysosome of substrate. Subsequent efforts have led to CNS permeable GCS inhibitors including venglustat, which is advancing through late stage clinical trials. The α-glucosidase inhibitor, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, known commercially as miglustat, also inhibits GCS and is approved for treating Niemann–Pick disease type C and Gaucher disease.Inhibitors of glycosphingolipid metabolism. The search for active compounds often benefits from serendipity and the synthesis of disaccharide (or larger) acceptor analogs with appropriate modifications is labor intensive, as is the preparation of complicated nucleotide sugar analogs. Nevertheless, the approach has yielded insights into the binding and reactivity of the glycan-processing enzymes, and substrate analogs with selectivity for particular enzymes have been developed in this way. Improvements in recombinant expression systems have led to increasing numbers of X-ray crystal structures, which provides clues for deriving mechanism-based inhibitors in the future (Chapter 6).The utility of any glycosyltransferase inhibitor ultimately depends on its ability to cross the plasma membrane and enter the Golgi where the glycosyltransferases reside. Unfortunately, many of the compounds described above lack activity in cells, presumably because their polarity and charge prevents their uptake. More than 40 years ago, Okayama and colleagues found that D-xylose in β-linkage to a hydrophobic aglycone (the noncarbohydrate portion of a glycoside) was taken up efficiently and inhibited the assembly of glycosaminoglycans on proteoglycans. Xylosides mimic the natural substrate, xylosylated serine residues in proteoglycan core proteins, and thus act as a substrate. “Priming” of chains occurs on the added xyloside, which diverts the assembly process from the endogenous core proteins and causes inhibition of proteoglycan formation. In general, cells incubated with xylosides secrete large amounts of individual glycosaminoglycan chains and accumulate proteoglycans containing truncated chains. The success of β-D-xylosides in altering proteoglycan biosynthesis suggested that other glycosides might function similarly (Figure 55.5). Subsequent studies showed that β-N-acetylgalactosaminides prime oligosaccharides found on mucins and inhibit O-glycosylation of glycoproteins. Other active glycosides include β-glucosides, β-galactosides, β-N-acetylglucosaminides, and even disaccharides and trisaccharides. These latter compounds require conjugation to appropriate aglycones and acetylation to mask the polar carbohydrate hydroxyl groups. Cells contain several carboxyesterases that remove the acetyl groups and render the compounds available to the transferases in the Golgi.Examples of glycoside primers. Structures shown are the compounds administered to cells; the depictions of the disaccharides do not show their acetylation. Below the names of the compounds are the glycan classes that are impacted. Priming by glycosides occurs in a concentration-dependent manner, but the efficiency varies widely among different compounds and cell types. These variations may relate to the relative abundance of endogenous substrates, enzyme concentration and composition, the solubility of different glycosides, their susceptibility to hydrolysis, their uptake across the plasma membrane and into the Golgi, and their relative affinity for the glycosyltransferases. The type of chain made on a given primer also depends on concentration and aglycone structure, which may reflect selective partitioning of primers into different intracellular compartments or into different branches of biosynthetic pathways. Like priming, inhibition of glycoprotein, glycolipid, or proteoglycan formation occurs in a dose-dependent fashion, but the blockade is rarely complete, probably because of the inability of glycosides to mimic the entire endogenous substrates.Primers represent starting points for tight-binding inhibitors with the properties described above. The compounds described in Figure 55.5 could be converted to permeable acylated glycosides and tested in live cells for inhibitory activity. Active compounds could potentially become lead compounds for drugs to treat glycosylation-dependent diseases. Oligosaccharide priming may have beneficial effects as well. Xylosides, for example, can be absorbed through the gut, and when consumed at sufficient concentration, show antithrombotic activity. Many glycosides occur naturally because various organisms (especially plants) produce hydrophobic compounds as part of chemical defense and conjugate them to sugars to render them soluble. Thus, the human diet may contain various types of glycosides with interesting (and unknown) biological activities.Care must be taken in interpreting the results of experiments using glycoside primers. For example, β-D-xylosides also prime glycans related in structure to glycosphingolipids and HNK-1. In some cases priming per se is not the mechanism responsible for inhibition of glycosylation, but rather inhibition occurs because of competitive binding of the primer to a target enzyme. Finally, primers could deplete cells of nucleotide sugars and have multiple effects on glycosylation. For example, 4-methylumbelliferone can be used to block hyaluronan biosynthesis. The precise mechanism of action is unknown but is thought to involve depletion of UDP-GlcA due to glucuronidation of the glycoside primer. Reduction in cellular UDP-GlcA levels in turn affects formation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and other glucuronic acid–containing glycans and alter the pools of other nucleotide sugars, such as UDP-Xyl, which is produced in one step from UDP-GlcA (Chapter 5).Chain terminators are compounds that are introduced into a growing glycan by a glycosyltransferase, but in so doing introduces a functionality that prevents further elongation. Mannosamine acts as a metabolic inhibitor that inhibits GPI anchor formation both in Trypanosoma brucei and in mammalian cells by the formation of ManNH2-Man-GlcNH2-PI. Apparently, mannosamine in its activated form (GDP-ManNH2) is used as a substrate in the second mannosyltransferase reaction, but the ManNH2-Man-GlcNH2-PI intermediate will not act as a substrate for the next α2-mannosyl-transferase (Chapter 12). GlcNR-phosphatidylinositols with different substituents (R) act as substrate analogs and some act as suicide inhibitors in vitro. Another class of inhibitors is based on fatty acid analogs that only trypanosomes incorporate into GPI anchors. Trypanosomes, unlike their mammalian hosts, incorporate myristic acid into GPI anchors by exchanging myristic acid for other fatty acids in the phosphatidylinositol moiety. By making a series of analogs, an inhibitor was found that is highly toxic to trypanosomes in culture and nontoxic to mammalian cells (10-(propoxy)decanoic acid). Such reagents are drug candidates for treating trypanosomiasis, which is endemic in sub-Saharan regions of Africa. Additional examples of chain terminators have been reported. For example, fluorinated sugar nucleotides (Figure 55.1) are incorporated into growing oligosaccharides by carbohydrate polymerases, but the resulting products lack the hydroxyl group to enable further polymerization.The increasing number of X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM investigations of carbohydrate processing enzymes has provided structural information that has facilitated the rational design of new inhibitors, often with very high potency. These compounds have been used as research tools and some have also advanced to clinically used drugs.Studies of influenza neuraminidase exemplify the power of rationally designed drugs that have successfully been marketed as drugs. The crystal structure for influenza neuraminidase was obtained in 1983, and many other enzymes have since been characterized from other sources. Even before the crystal structure had been obtained, a neuraminidase inhibitor was designed by assuming that the hydrolysis reaction involved an oxocarbenium ion–like transition state with significant positive charge accumulation at the anomeric center. This would result in C-2 and C-3 adopting a planar configuration, and therefore compounds that mimicked this geometry were hoped to have inhibitory activity. Indeed, Neu5Ac-2-ene (DANA; Figure 55.6) has a micromolar Ki value. Interestingly, this compound inhibits most sialidases, but does not inhibit the trypanosome trans-sialidase and only weakly bacterial sialidases.Structure of neuraminidase inhibitors. Chemical structure of sialic acid (Neu5Ac, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetyl neuraminic acid), DANA; 4-amino-DANA; 4-guanidino-DANA (Relenza, zanamivir); (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxyl)-1-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic (more...)A visual inspection of the X-ray structure of influenza neuraminidase with DANA bound showed that two glutamate residues lined a pocket near carbon 4 of the sialic acid analog. The pocket is fairly open, suggesting that a bulkier substituent at this position might be tolerated. A substrate analog containing a positively charged guanidinium group instead of the hydroxyl at carbon 4 (4-guanidino-DANA; Figure 55.6) is a remarkably potent influenza neuraminidase inhibitor (Ki=10−11m). The higher affinity is presumably due to a salt bridge formed between the charged guanidinium group and the carboxylates lining the pocket. The analog is nearly a million times less potent on human sialidases, leading to its approval and use as the anti-influenza drug Relenza (Chapter 57). It does not work on bacterial sialidases, however, because the equivalent pocket is filled with an arginine group and is only a modest (low-micromolar) inhibitor of the human neuraminidases. Next-generation analogs of Relenza including the close derivative laninamivir as well as the guanidinium-containing peramivir have also been developed.The presence of the guanidinium group requires these drugs to be either inhaled or injected. Subsequent studies focused on dispensing this functionality. Replacement of the pyranose ring with a cyclohexene to mimic the planar ring of the proposed intermediate in hydrolysis, protecting the carboxylate as an ester that is hydrolyzed after ingestion, and replacing the guanidinium with an amine led to an orally active, widely used analog, the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu (Figure 55.6; Chapter 57). Crystal structures for other sialidases have allowed the design of species-specific analogs. This rational approach to inhibitor design holds great potential, not only for neuraminidase inhibitors, but also, as described above, for O-GlcNAcase and OGT inhibitors. These examples illustrate how structure can guide design of carbohydrate-based inhibitors as well as heterocyclic inhibitors that have been more commonly advanced as drugs.These advances have stimulated greater interest into influenza neuraminidase as well as the four human neuraminidases, which have poorly understood physiological roles. A major challenge associated with viral neuraminidase inhibitors—most strikingly, Tamiflu—is the rapid development of mutations that confer resistance. An alternative approach to circumvent this problem has been to develop mechanism-based inhibitors that covalently inhibit the enzyme. One example, FaxGuDFSA, has a fluoride leaving group, the displacement of which by the neuraminidase forms a glycosyl–enzyme intermediate. This intermediate has an appreciable half-life because the electronegative fluorine destabilizes the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state that leads to its breakdown. Accordingly, this compound can protect mice against infection. Moreover, the emergence of resistant influenza strains is slower than against Tamiflu.In addition to driving increased effort against influenza neuraminidase, efforts to create inhibitors of the human neuraminidases have benefited from the fact that DANA and Relenza are modest and nonselective inhibitors of these enzymes. Medicinal chemistry efforts using DANA as a starting point has yielded useful inhibitors for these enzymes by exploiting structural differences in their active sites. One example, C9-4HMT-DANA (Figure 55.6), is the most potent and selective inhibitor of any of these enzymes having an ∼100 nm Ki value and exhibiting 500-fold selectivity over any of the other family members. Doubtless, structures of these human enzymes are likely to accelerate the development of new selective inhibitors.The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Manfred Wulhrer.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Schnaar.Knowledge of the cellular pathways of glycosylation across phylogeny provides opportunities for designing glycans via genetic engineering in a wide variety of cell types including bacteria, fungi, plant cells, and mammalian cells. The commercial demand for glycosylation engineering is broad, including production of biological therapeutics with defined glycosylation (Chapter 57). This chapter describes how knowledge of glycan structures and their metabolism (Chapters 2–27) has led to the current state of glycosylation engineering in different cell types. Perspectives for rapid advances in this area using precise gene editing technologies are also described.There is a long history of engineering glycosylation in mammalian cells, plants, fungi (yeast), and bacteria using genetic strategies, and many well-characterized glycosylation mutants are available (Chapters 20–27 and 49). This chapter focuses on approaches and methods for designing glycosylation in cells, whereas other active areas of engineering glycans to produce structural bioproducts, foods, and fuels are not covered. Today, cellular glycoengineering is often used to produce recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins that require glycosylation for their efficacy and at the same time must have human-compatible glycosylation to avoid immune responses to nonhuman glycans. Glycosylation can alter the size, charge, and solubility of therapeutic glycoproteins to prevent rapid clearance from the circulation. In addition, glycoengineering has been used to improve or develop new therapeutic modalities (Chapter 57). Glycans can also serve as ligands for lectin receptors that target therapeutics to certain cells. Of particular importance is the role of N-glycosylation for effector functions of IgG antibodies; therapeutic IgG antibodies with N-glycosylation designed to improve their cytotoxic properties are in clinical use. In the past decade, new methods have emerged to precisely engineer glycosylation by gene editing, and with increased knowledge the field seems to be limited only by imagination.Cell lines are widely used as factories to produce recombinant glycoproteins from introduced gene constructs. The most common factories for glycoproteins include yeast, plants, insect cells, nonhuman mammalian cells, and, more rarely, human cells. More recently, bacteria are also being engineered to accommodate production of glycoproteins. The glycosylation capabilities of different species vary substantially in terms of both the sites of glycan attachment and the glycans attached (Figure 56.1 and Chapters 9–27). A first step in glycoengineering strategies is therefore to consider which cell type to use. This decision requires detailed knowledge of glycosylation pathways and genes. Historically, the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line has played a dominant role, and today most biologics are produced in CHO cells (Chapter 49). The CHO line was selected for human therapeutic production because its glycosylation capacities are relatively simple and resemble those of humans. The CHO cell line produces a comparatively narrow repertoire of glycans that are not immunogenic in humans; glycoengineering can expand their native glycosylation capabilities and provide optimization of glycoforms. Alternate host species in which native glycosylation (or lack thereof) provides a simpler starting point for engineering can also be selected. For example, glycoproteins for enzyme replacement therapies have been produced in yeast and glycan vaccines in bacteria.Overview of species-specific glycosylation features. The figure presents the different classes of glycoconjugates present in mammalian, plant, insect, and yeast cells with a representative glycan from each class. Structures to the right of the break are (more...)There have been major achievements in glycoengineering of cells from bacteria to yeast and “higher” eukaryotes (Table 56.1 and Chapter 49). New precise gene editing technologies described below enable glycoengineering in a wide variety of species and open opportunities for selection of host cells based on optimal production efficiency and production of human-like glycans. Common principles in glycoengineering via gene editing are described below, followed by more detailed descriptions of progress in cells from various species.Examples of major achievements in glycoengineering of cells Although the glycomes of different species have distinct features (Figure 56.1), the basic biosynthetic machinery and pathways are remarkably conserved in eukaryotes, and there are even similarities with glycosylation pathways in some bacteria and Archaea. Most enzymes involved in glycosylation in eukaryotes are highly conserved in fungi, plants, and animals, facilitating the design and execution of glycoengineering strategies in these organisms. Nevertheless, current knowledge is far from complete, and glycoengineering across species is still in its infancy. Whereas expression of a particular protein in a heterologous host may require only introduction of the single gene for that protein, precise glycosylation engineering of that protein may require introduction of a suite of genes, including those required for the biosynthesis and transport of appropriate activated nucleotide sugar donors, as well as multiple glycosyltransferases.Successful glycoengineering requires knowledge of the glycosyltransferase genes and substrates required to direct synthesis of a particular glycan. Certain genes may need to be removed and others inserted to create biosynthetic pathways that produce the glycans of interest. Four decades of glycogene discoveries have resulted in the identification of many genes encoding glycosyltransferases, hydrolases, and other enzymes involved in synthesizing and metabolizing the glycans of eukaryotic cells and the biosynthetic pathways involved (Chapters 8–19). Different glycosylation pathways may function independently using different sets of enzymes or, in some cases, may share enzymes. Enzymes working in consecutive order to assemble mature glycans generally work independently, although there may also be cooperative effects. In principle, there is sufficient knowledge to predict the role of individual enzymes and assign them to specific pathways, allowing prediction of the enzyme repertoire required to generate a particular glycan on a particular glycoconjugate. An excellent resource in this regard is the classification of homologous gene families from diverse species in the “Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes” (CAZy) database (Chapter 8).Among the prerequisites for glycoengineering a desired glycan in a chosen host is that the appropriate repertoire of activated sugar donors and their transporters are present (Chapter 5). This is especially important when engineering glycosylation in prokaryotes or nonmammalian eukaryotes in which the nucleotide sugar donors required to synthesize therapeutics with human glycosylation may not be present. For example, yeast does not produce UDP-GalNAc, and many organisms do not produce CMP-sialic acids.Different genetic strategies may be used to alter the glycosylation capabilities of cells. Knockdown and nontargeted overexpression in eukaryotes have been used for many years, and precisely targeted gene editing strategies are now well-established.Reducing undesirable glycosyltransferase activities in cells has been achieved by gene silencing strategies. Whereas this has been particularly successful in plants and Drosophila, silencing has not gained wide use in glycoengineering mammalian cell lines because the low efficiency of knockdown often leaves undesirable levels of target glycosyltransferase activity remaining.Adding desirable glycosyltransferase activities to eukaryotic cells is achieved by transfection of glycogenes from any organism, random integration of plasmid DNA, and antibiotic selection of stable clones. Although this strategy is successful, it provides no control over site(s) of genomic integration (unless specific strategies are used), gene copy number, or gene expression levels. Overexpression of enzymes can lead to disruption of normal glycosylation patterns and unpredictable glycosylation. Instability of the introduced glycosylation genes and the use of antibiotics for selection have also been problematic for the long-term use of such engineered cells for production of therapeutic glycoproteins.Knockout of glycosylation genes to eliminate unwanted glycans has long been a simple task in bacteria and yeast. Although powerful, knockout or knock-in strategies have been time-consuming and difficult to use in “higher” eukaryotic cells (see Fut8 knockout below). However, these difficulties were substantially reduced with the introduction of nuclease-based precise gene editing tools including zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator–like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/targeted Cas9 endonucleases (CRISPR/Cas9), which enable highly specific gene manipulation in all cell types (Figure 56.2; Chapters 27 and 49). These tools can also be used to activate endogenous silent genes, edit gene sequences to mimic hypomorphic disease mutations, and insert foreign genes at specific genomic sites.Precise gene editing modalities. Glycosyltransferases are represented with their catalytic domains and amino-terminal membrane spanning domains. Examples of gene editing for gene disruption (knockout), mutation, tagging, and insertion of heterologous (more...)Precise gene editing can insert foreign genes at “safe harbor” sites in the genome to ensure stable expression and avoid interfering with endogenous gene expression. One such safe harbor in human cells is the AAVS1 site on chromosome 19 known to enable stable expression of transgenes without adverse effects. However, precise genetic engineering allows insertion of one or more foreign genes at any position in the genome. For example, precise knock-in of glycogenes can be combined with knockout by inserting an exogenous gene in place of an unwanted endogenous gene. Precise knock-in strategies also enable control of the number of copies inserted and can be used to insert entire landing platforms of multiple genes inserted consecutively.Successful expression of an enzyme or transporter for glycoengineering requires that the expressed protein finds its way to the correct subcellular compartment. Heterologous expression of type 2 Golgi transmembrane glycosyltransferases, for example, often requires testing different Golgi retention sequences. Although design guidance is available, this is often a trial and error exercise, and in some cases a combinatorial screening is required to identify the optimal construct.The most common bacterium used for heterologous protein production, Escherichia coli, does not have the native capacity to glycosylate proteins. However, research in the last two decades identified N- and O-glycoproteins, and the glycosylation pathways responsible for their biosynthesis, in the pathogenic proteobacterium Campylobacter jejuni and other bacterial species. Moreover, several bacterial toxins have glycosyltransferase domains that exert their pathogenicity by glycosylating highly specific amino acids in key host proteins to interfere with essential cellular functions. Chapter 21 discusses glycosylation in Eubacteria. Another unique feature of bacteria is that sugar nucleotide donors are synthesized and remain in the cytosol, so that engineered glycan assembly on a lipid carrier (for systems based on en bloc glycosylation) or on proteins directly (for systems based on processive glycosylation) must take place in the cytosol unless nucleotide sugar transporters are introduced to the periplasmic membrane.Bacteria efficiently produce free and lipid-linked oligo- and polysaccharides including capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) (Chapter 21), and these pathways have been engineered to produce a variety of complex human-like glycans. In particular, the LPS pathway has been used to engineer and display glycans in E. coli. LPS consists of a base lipid (lipid A) linked to a core oligosaccharide followed by highly diverse O-polysaccharides (O-antigens). Genetically interrupting biosynthesis of the lipid A core oligosaccharide prevents coupling of the O-antigen, thereby allowing engineering of novel glycans on lipid A for display on the cell surface. This strategy has been used to engineer the synthesis of a variety of human glycan epitopes, including blood group antigens (Chapter 14) and cancer-associated glycolipid glycans (Chapter 11).In a complex example of engineering large free complex glycans in bacteria, 4-O-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (Chapter 17), was produced in E. coli by deleting a fructosyltransferase (kfoE), introducing bacterial UDP-Glc/-GlcNAc 4-epimerase and chondroitin synthase genes, and introducing a mutated human chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase gene, opening the way for glycosaminoglycan production in bacteria.Two types of native protein N-glycosylation occur in some bacteria, although not in E. coli. One type is similar to eukaryotic cell N-glycosylation with production of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide in the cytosol, which is then transferred en bloc to Asn by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) in the periplasm. The OST of C. jejuni, PglB, is a single polypeptide related to the catalytic STT3 subunits of the multiprotein OST complex of eukaryotes (Chapter 9). PglB shows a more restricted acceptor sequence motif than the eukaryotic N-X-S/T, with requirement of an acidic residue (D/EXNXS/T, in which X cannot be P) (Chapter 21). This places some restrictions on the usefulness of engineering human-like N-glycans, because most N-glycan sites in mammalian proteins do not conform to this extended consensus sequence. PglBs from other species, or mutants evolved by adaptive evolution, have been identified to address this problem, but further improvements are needed. Importantly, PglB has rather relaxed donor substrate specificity. Although bacterial lipid-linked oligosaccharides are distinct from those in eukaryotes, PglB can use mammalian-type lipid-linked oligosaccharides as donors.An important feature for using prokaryotes for glycoengineering is the arrangement of entire glycosylation machineries in multigene operons. This enables the transfer of large genetic elements of 10–20 kb between species. A major achievement was the successful transfer of the entire N-glycosylation operon from C. jejuni to E. coli, producing N-linked glycoproteins in E. coli. Production of glycoproteins carrying a Man3GlcNAc2 core N-glycan has been achieved by introduction of eukaryotic enzymes (Table 56.1). Bacterial N-linked glycosylation is being exploited as an alternative method for glycoconjugate vaccine production, and vaccines against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have been developed.Another type of N-glycosylation found in γ-proteobacteria involves a cytosolic N-glycosyltransferase (NGT) that targets the N-X-S/T acceptor sequence motif recognized by mammalian OST (Chapter 9). NGT transfers a single monosaccharide (e.g., Glc) from an activated sugar nucleotide donor, with loose donor substrate specificity that includes both UDP and GDP sugar nucleotides. This provides an entirely new approach to engineering alternate types of N-glycosylation. Engineering this pathway in bacteria resulted in the assembly of glycan motifs including α1-3-galactose epitopes as well as fucosylated and sialylated lactose or poly-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units primed by Glc residues on glycoproteins (Table 56.1).Although most bacteria do not have the capacity for sialylation, there are exceptions (Chapters 15 and 21). Bacterial genes for CMP-sialic acid synthesis and for sialyltransferases with specificities similar to those in mammals have been introduced with plasmids or integrated into the genome of host bacteria cells, enabling the production of sialylated N- and O-glycoproteins.Some bacteria have processive O-glycosylation pathways controlled by glycosyltransferases using activated sugar donors. These pathways inspired the engineering of human O-glycosylation reactions in E. coli. By introducing mammalian polypeptide GalNAc-transferase genes and a UDP-Glc/GlcNAc 4-epimerase, O-GalNAc protein glycosylation (Chapter 10) has been achieved. Further introduction of a β1-3-galactosyltransferase enabled biosynthesis of core 1 O-glycans (T antigen) on cytoplasmic acceptor proteins. Introduction of GalNAc residues has been used for postexpression enzymatic addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatized sialic acids to enhance the therapeutic properties of protein drugs.Other bacteria possess a protein O-glycosylation mechanism that is unlike the stepwise biosynthesis of O-glycans in eukaryotes (Chapter 10), in that preassembled undecaprenol-PP-linked oligosaccharides are transferred en bloc to proteins by several OSTs with relaxed donor substrate specificities and poorly understood acceptor substrate specificities. Engineering of this endogenous glycosylation machinery has been used for en bloc transfer of human O-GalNAc glycans (Tn, T, sialyl-Tn, and sialyl-T antigens) onto acceptor proteins (Table 56.1).Yeast natively produce N-glycans and O-mannosyl glycans on diverse glycoproteins. The general features of the biosynthetic pathways for initial glycan transfer are common in eukaryotes from yeast to human, and the enzymes involved are highly homologous. However, subsequent glycan processing in yeast generally results in polymannosylated glycans instead of the complex N- and O-glycans found in “higher” eukaryotes (Figure 56.1). Yeast have similar systems for protein folding, quality control, and posttranslational modifications to other eukaryotic cells, in contrast to bacteria. Because genetic engineering in yeast has long been rapid and easy, experience with glycoengineering is more advanced in this organism compared with most others. Several commercial ventures have been based on engineering “humanized” N-glycosylation in yeast; the Pichia GlycoSwitch platform uses engineered yeast to add simple human N-glycans to expressed proteins.N-glycans on yeast glycoproteins differ from those in vertebrates (Chapter 9), comprising large polymannosyl glycans on a poly(Manα1-6)n backbone, which are highly immunogenic in mammals (Chapter 23). A key α1-6-mannosyltransferase, Och1p largely initiates polymannosylation. Knockout of the och1 gene, however, does not completely abrogate polymannosylation, and additional knockouts of mannosyl- and phosphomannosyltransferases, depending on yeast strain, are needed to achieve a homogenous Man8GlcNAc2 N-glycan suitable for further engineering. Reducing Man8GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 is achieved by expressing an α1-2-mannosidase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), creating a convenient platform for generating complex N-glycans. Introduction of GlcNAcT-I (MGAT1) in the Golgi initiates complex N-glycan synthesis, and further addition of α3/6-mannosidase II (MAN2A1) and GlcNAcT-II (MGAT2) results in the biantennary GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 N-glycan suitable for appending galactose and sialic acid by further engineering. Some yeast species, including Pichia pastoris, do not contain UDP-Gal, and all yeast lack the native ability to synthesize CMP-Neu5Ac, so considerable engineering with introduction of multiple genes is required to obtain mature complex N-glycans. Although the engineering appears simple in silico, considerable efforts have been devoted to identifying optimal chimeric gene constructs with respect to both catalytic efficiency and ER/Golgi targeting.Yeast perform extensive co- and posttranslational ER protein O-mannosylation (Chapter 23) using several polypeptide mannosyltransferases (PMTs). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has six PMTs, and only a subset can be knocked out without reducing viability. Protein O-Man residues undergo polymannosylation in the Golgi. Muticellular eukaryotes also perform O-mannosylation and express two PMT orthologs, POMT1 and POMT2 (Chapter 13), but these have narrower acceptor substrate specificities. However, multicellular eukaryotes perform several other types of O-glycosylation (Figure 56.1) (Chapters 10, 13, and 14), and their O-GalNAc glycans tend to be located in similar regions and protein sites as O-Man glycans in yeast. This means that expression of human O-glycoproteins in yeast may result in O-mannosylation at sites that carry O-GalNAc in mammals. Examples of this include the hinge region of IgA and mucin sequences. Because it is still difficult to predict types of O-glycosylation, human proteins expressed in yeast must be tested to determine if they are O-mannosylated.Human O-GalNAc glycans have been successfully engineered into yeast by introducing human polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (Chapter 10) along with UDP-Glc/GlcNAc C4-epimerase and a UDP-Gal/GalNAc Golgi transporter. The entire biosynthetic machinery for CMP-Neu5Ac synthesis and transport has also been introduced together with a human sialyltransferase, and sialylated O-glycans have been produced in yeast. The problem with competing endogenous O-mannosylation can be partly eliminated by including a mannosyltransferase inhibitor (rhodanine-3-acetic acid). A deeper understanding of the yeast O-Man and human O-GalNAc glycosylation pathways is needed to provide new strategies to circumvent competition between the two systems and enhance O-glycan engineering in yeast.Plants offer a simpler starting point than yeast for N-glycan humanization because the predominant native N-glycans of plants are paucimannose (Man3GlcNAc2) and biantennary terminating in GlcNAc (GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2). The abundance of paucimannose N-glycans appears to be due to a β-hexosaminidase that removes attached GlcNAc residues in competition with GlcNAc-transferases, a feature also found in insect cells. Two plant-specific N-glycan modifications include core α1-3-Fuc (instead of mammalian core α1-6-Fuc) and β1-2-Xyl linked to the β-Man in the N-glycan core. Both modifications are potentially immunogenic in humans. Plants also produce unique types of O-glycosylation not found in other species that pose potential problems for the generation of therapeutic glycoproteins.Great advances in engineering plants for human-like N-glycosylation have been achieved. Knockdown or knockout of the β-hexosaminidase that inhibits complex N-glycan formation, as well as the α1-3 fucosyltransferase and β1-2 xylosyltransferase, have been achieved in different plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Nearly homogeneous biantennary GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 N-glycans were produced. These were further engineered by the introduction of Gal (using B4GALT1) and sialic acid (using ST6GAL1 along with the enzymes needed to synthesize and transport CMP-Neu5Ac) in an engineering design using up to six gene constructs. Such humanized plants produced α2-6-Neu5Ac capped biantennary N-glycans without core fucose on a variety of recombinant glycoproteins. These achievements depended on combinatorial screening strategies to identify appropriate chimeric constructs of exogenous enzymes to drive the engineered glycosylation toward homogeneity.Glycoproteins produced in plants carrying native paucimannose N-glycosylation are in use as approved drugs. For enzyme replacement therapy, the terminal mannose N-glycans of glucocerebrosidase (taliglucerase alfa) produced in carrots is beneficial for targeting to endogenous human mannose receptors, despite α1-3-Fuc and β1-2-Xyl modifications, and is in clinical use. Moreover, glycoengineered N. benthamiana cells without α1-3-Fuc and β1-2-Xyl have been used to produce a triple-antibody cocktail used to treat Ebola virus infections.Plants do not have the types of O-glycosylation found in other eukaryotes but produce extensins and arabinogalactan proteins with two unique O-glycans. A family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4H) converts selected Pro residues to hydroxyproline that may be arabinosylated by a series of enzymes. In addition, Ser residues may be O-glycosylated by the addition of Gal residues. Although a number of the P4Hs and glycosyltransferases have been knocked out in different plants, it is unclear whether these modifications can be completely eliminated without affecting viability. Nonetheless, the human machinery for O-GalNAc glycosylation has been engineered into plants by introducing the necessary polypeptide GalNAc-transferases and elongation enzymes, whereas UDP-Glc/-GlcNAc 4-epimerase and a UDP-GalNAc transporter may not be required. Human core 1 O-glycan biosynthesis and sialylation machinery including ST3GalI sialyltransferase have also been successfully introduced into plants. If issues related to hydroxyproline can be resolved, plants offer a valuable system in which different types of mammalian O-glycosylation could be engineered and exploited. A clear highlight of glycoengineering in plants was the combined introduction of 14 genes for production of the major human therapeutic glycoprotein erythropoietin with human sialylated biantennary N-glycans and core 1 O-glycans in tobacco cells (Table 56.1).Engineering in insect cells involves multiple strategies. Two different platforms are generally used for recombinant expression of proteins—transient expression in the baculovirus-insect cell system and constitutive expression in Sf9 Spodoptera frugiperda or S2 Drosophila melanogaster cells. The baculovirus-insect cell platform can be glycoengineered by including glycosylation genes in either the recombinant baculovirus vector genome or the insect cell line host genome. Engineering host insect cell lines has been the more common strategy, but remarkable success has been achieved by incorporating up to nine glycogenes in a baculovirus vector (Table 56.1). CRISPR/Cas gene targeting of Sf9 insect cells has been established, and their use for glycoengineered baculovirus protein expression is feasible.Insect cells produce mostly high-mannose and paucimannose N-glycans despite having the genetic capacity to produce complex sialylated N-glycans (Figure 56.1). This is due in part to the action of a processing β-hexosaminidase, FDL, which removes attached GlcNAc residues from the α1-3-Man branch, and in part to low levels of GlcNAcT-II (MGAT2) activity. Like plants, some insect cells may add a potentially immunogenic core α1-3-Fuc and do not typically add terminal sialic acids. However, sialylation has been engineered by introducing genes encoding a CMP-sialic acid synthase and an N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate 2′-epimerase into insect cells. For efficient sialylation, a dedicated CMP-sialic acid transporter appears to be needed as well. Using different strategies, production of glycoproteins carrying biantennary N-glycans with galactosylation and sialic acid capping has been achieved. Precision gene editing was used to knock out fdl in Sf9 and S2 cells to greatly improve complex N-glycan formation.Insect cells perform the same range of O-glycosylation reactions as mammalian cells (Figure 56.1), although the extent to which O-GalNAc glycans are attached at the same sites as in mammals is unexplored. Moreover, processing of O-glycans is limited to mainly truncated core 1 structures (Tn and T). Although insect cells offer a straightforward host for production of glycoproteins with human O-glycans, little has been investigated in this regard.The cores of all types of glycoprotein glycans (Figure 56.1) are highly conserved among mammals, although there are terminal glycan variations (Chapter 14). At least 16 different glycosylation pathways have been delineated in mammalian cells; maps of the predicted genetic regulation of biosynthetic steps by more than 170 distinct glycosyltransferases have been generated. The most popular mammalian cell line used for glycoengineering is the CHO cell line established more than 60 years ago. The success of the CHO cell line is partly due to the ease with which glycosylation mutants could be isolated (Chapter 49), and it was the first cell used to manufacture a recombinant therapeutic with relatively simple human-type terminal glycans without expression of antigenic nonhuman glycans or unusual modifications of the glycans. As discussed in Chapter 49, the CHO cell line has an important place in glycoengineering history, exemplified by the Lec mutant lines generated by lectin selection. These cell lines with distinct mutations in glycosylation genes have provided tools for the scientific community for more than three decades and illustrate the importance of access to recombinant proteins with particular glycoforms for discovery of biological functions of glycans.CHO cells can be considered as Glycobiology\\'s gift to Biopharma. Major successes have been achieved in engineering CHO and other mammalian cell lines for production of human therapeutics (Table 56.1 and Chapters 49 and 57). The field is, however, undergoing a revolution with the new methods for facile, targeted, precise gene editing that allow the design of almost any conceivable glycosylation capacity in any mammalian cell by combining knockout and knock-in events.The first major feat in gene editing of mammalian cells was elimination of the core α1-6-Fuc for production of recombinant IgG antibodies with enhanced binding to the Fcγ-IIIa receptor (Table 56.1). Overexpression of bisecting GlcNAcT-III (MGAT3) resulted in stable CHO cells with highly limited capacity for core fucosylation (commercialized by Roche). A second strategy involved a tour-de-force approach using homologous recombination (HR) to knock out the two Fut8 alleles in CHO cells. More than 10,000 CHO clones were screened to identify the final knockout cell. Although this was an impressive achievement, such laborious random selection limits options for selecting cell clones that retain the attributes needed for optimal bioprocessing. Using precise gene editing, the same engineering was rapidly replicated, providing ample clones for selection of those with optimal properties. Glycoengineered CHO lines optimized for antibody production are now commercially available (Potelligent CHOK1SV, Lonza/Kyowa Kirin BioWa). Another elegant strategy introduced GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase to deflect the endogenous production of GDP-Fuc and enable fine-tuning of fucosylation by exogenous addition of fucose.Engineering N-glycan sialylation has been another focus in the field. CHO cells produce only α2-3-linked sialic acids on N-glycans, whereas human HEK293-T cells (for example) produce a mixture of α2-3- and α2-6-linked sialic acids. Most soluble glycoproteins in human blood (including IgG) have α2-6-linked sialic acids on N-glycans, and reports have suggested that the sialic acid linkage may influence immunomodulatory functions as well as circulatory half-life. It has therefore been of interest to engineer more homogeneous α2-6-sialylation in cells. These efforts have mainly been limited to the overexpression of α2-6-sialyltransferases to override endogenous α2-3-sialylation with variable results, illustrating the complexity of engineering glycosylation in cells with competing pathways.An innovative glycoengineering strategy (GlycoDelete) reduced the inherent heterogeneity of mammalian N-glycan structures. Human HEK293-T cells lacking MGAT1 were stably transfected to express a fungal endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoT) that efficiently truncated N-glycans to a single GlcNAc, which was an acceptor for galactosylation and sialylation. Recombinant antibodies with truncated N-glycans had lower affinity for Fcγ receptors, suggesting that this glycoengineering strategy may be suitable for use with neutralizing antibodies.Deconstruction of the N-glycosylation pathway in CHO cells was performed by precise gene editing to knock out 19 glycosyltransferases, including all four α2-3-sialyltransferases that function on N-glycans (Figure 56.3). Combining knockout of St3gal4 and St3gal6 with site-specific knock-in of St6gal1 resulted in homogeneous α2-6-sialylation. Combinatorial knockout of all isoenzymes involved in N-glycan sialylation, galactosylation/LacNAc formation, branching, and core fucosylation has provided a design matrix for improving the homogeneity of N-glycans in CHO cells. A combination of five gene knockouts and the knock-in of St6gal1 created the glycoprotein therapeutic erythropoietin having homogeneous biantennary N-glycans with terminal α2-6-Neu5Ac. Wider engineering of almost all genes involved in N-glycosylation in CHO cells has shown that there are few limitations for engineering of glycosylation. For example, the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (Gnptab) that tags select oligomannose N-glycans on glycoproteins destined for lysosomal targeting was knocked out to produce lysosomal enzymes bearing complex-type sialylated glycans with extended blood circulation and improved biodistribution.(A) A complex N-glycan with glycosyltransferases responsible for each reaction. Combinatorial knockout of the glycosyltransferase isoenzyme genes indicated led to the identification of the primary genes (highlighted in bold) controlling N-glycan branching (more...)Therapeutic glycoprotein production still suffers from heterogeneity, including variations in which Asn residues are glycosylated (site occupancy, macroheterogeneity) and/or the diversity of mature glycan structures at any one site (microheterogeneity). This is currently addressed by ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through the use of highly standardized bioprocessing protocols, but this strategy is far from optimal. For example, incompletely sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins may be cleared by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell–Morell receptor), resulting in inconsistent circulatory half-lives of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 34). Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sialylation by overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases as well as inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases in host cells. Protein-specific glycosylation patterns and heterogeneity are more difficult to control.Nonhuman mammalian cell lines can produce two immunogenic nonhuman glycans: α1-3-Gal added to N-acetyllactosamine and Neu5Gc added to Gal or GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 15). The α1-3-galactosyltransferase and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydrolase genes responsible are inactive in humans. Although α1-3-Gal and Neu5Gc are not produced in CHO cells, both genes have been knocked out as a precaution. Even so, Neu5Gc scavenged from animal glycoproteins used in cell culture can appear in expressed glycoproteins, so use of defined media lacking nonhuman glycoproteins is also necessary. In engineering mammalian cell lines, it is important to consider that the glycosylation capacity is driven by the expression of a subset of available enzyme genes, but unexpressed genes can become activated. Thus, cell-specific glycosylation features are generally controlled by transcriptional regulation rather than mutations or gene aberrations. Analysis of all known glycosylation genes in five distinct CHO production cell lines derived from the original CHO-K1 cell line found no apparent deleterious mutations or loss of genes, despite severe chromosomal alterations. This suggests that one must consider all the known glycogenes in a mammalian cell line for glycoengineering strategies.Engineering the glycosylation capacity of CHO cells has also enabled more homogeneous bioconjugation of therapeutic drugs. For example, therapeutic drugs may be chemically conjugated with PEG chains to enhance circulatory half-life, but chemical conjugation is difficult to direct to specific sites in glycoproteins. A strategy for enzymatic modification of glycans postproduction has been developed that involves desialylation of recombinant glycoproteins, followed by in vitro transfer of a modified (PEGylated) Neu5Ac (as its CMP analog) to exposed Gal/GalNAc residues by a sialyltransferase. The process is in use with approved drugs, although heterogeneous modifications occur when multiantennary N-glycans are targeted. CHO cells have now been engineered to produce monoantennary, unsialylated N-glycans, which circumvent heterogeneity while retaining multiple exposed Gal acceptor sites for sialo-PEGylation.Mammalian cells perform many different types of O-glycosylation (Figure 56.1), and although these exert diverse and important biological functions, the interest in O-glycans for recombinant therapeutics has been limited. Nevertheless, recombinant coagulation factors in clinical use carry O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, and/or O-Glc glycans, and many other approved drugs including erythropoietin and Enbrel have O-GalNAc glycans. O-GalNAc glycans are also used for site-specific bioconjugation.Engineering O-GalNAc glycans involves a new level of complexity because up to 20 isoenzymes (polypeptide GalNAc-transferases) direct the initiation of O-GalNAc glycans. It may therefore be important to consider the repertoire of these enzymes in a cell line. In theory, a protein that is naturally found with an O-glycan may not be O-glycosylated when expressed in a specific production cell line, and vice versa. An illuminating case is the important phosphaturic factor FGF23, a potential drug for patients with a congenital deficiency associated with hyperphosphatemia, which requires an O-GalNAc glycan for activity. The repertoire of polypeptide GalNAc-transferases in CHO and HEK293 cells has been extensively engineered by knockout and also knock-in of GALNT genes, revealing adaptation of mammalian cells to loss of O-glycosylation capacities.Glycoengineering of cell lines has vast potential to address a number of unmet needs in the glycosciences. As already mentioned, the CHO Lec, Ldl, Pgs, and Pig mutant cell lines (Chapters 12 and 49) served the research community for decades by providing defined alterations in glycosylation that enable studies of the functional roles of glycans. For example, CHO and HEK293-T mutant cells with MGAT1 deficiency have been widely used to produce recombinant proteins with homogeneous N-glycans suitable for crystallization studies.Moreover, targeting glycosylation genes in whole organisms has provided immense insight into the importance of glycosylation and has revealed biological functions of specific glycosylation genes (Chapter 41). However, discovery of distinct biological functions of specific glycans, and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in multicellular organisms, is complicated by cell-type regulation of glycosylation and the cellular heterogeneity of tissues. Cell lines help to answer certain specific questions and complement whole organism studies.Precise gene editing provides vast opportunities for glycoengineering cell lines and designing new strategies to probe glycan functions. Truncation of O-glycan elongation was used to produce homogeneous simple O-glycoproteomes (SimpleCell strategy), which enabled enrichment and sensitive mapping of the O-GalNAc and O-Man glycoproteomes of human cell lines. The development of isogenic cell lines differing in only one glycosyltransferase gene allows comparative studies to explore the function of a particular glycan or glycosylation pathway. For example, truncation of O-GalNAc glycans by targeting of the COSMC chaperone (Chapter 10) induced oncogenic features (proliferation, growth, and invasive behavior) of human nontransformed keratinocytes, an interesting finding in light of the frequent overexpression of truncated O-glycans (Tn, sialyl-Tn) in cancer. Large libraries of isogenic cells with comprehensive engineered glycosylation are used for cell-based glycan arrays and are useful for studying glycan binding in the natural context of the cell surface. The strategy has been expanded to organotypic tissue models used to address the more complex functions of distinct types of glycoconjugates (glycolipids, N-glycans, O-GalNAc, O-Fuc, O-Glc glycans) in human tissue formation.A related approach is to use glycoengineering for discovery of host glycans required for microbial and viral infectivity. In one remarkable study using binding of Lassa virus to a haploid cell line, the large number of glycogenes required for synthesis of the extended O-Man glycan termed matriglycan (Chapter 13) that are bound by Lassa virus were identified and validated using a combination of selection for virus resistance and TALEN-mediated gene knockout.Glycoengineering of cells has entered a phase that may be described as “LEGO toying” because of the efficiency of precise gene editing. Entire glycosylation machineries can be deconstructed and rebuilt in various cell types. Cells show remarkable plasticity for engineering glycosylation pathways, with only a few glycosylation enzymes essential for cell growth in vitro. The essential functions for viability of mammalian cells are the initial steps of N-glycosylation (Chapter 9) and nuclear/cytosolic O-GlcNAc modifications (Chapter 19). These aside, essentially all glycosylation pathways in cells can be genetically deconstructed. Combining engineering of glycosylation pathways in creative ways by introducing completely foreign enzymes can be used to produce novel glycans for study.Large-scale glycosylation screening and discovery strategies are possible. The CRISPR/Cas9 editing tool is particularly suited for multiplexed screening strategies, and whole-genome lentiviral-based knockout libraries have already been used for screening mutations that result in altered biological function. Although knockdown strategies have been successful for screening biological functions of glycogenes in multiple organisms (worms, flies, frogs, and zebrafish), these have generally not been effective in mammalian cells because of the low efficiency of knockdown. It is now possible to apply whole-glycogenome screening strategies in cell lines to probe and dissect the roles of glycosylation. These tools are dramatically improving options for dissection of structure–function relationships in the field.Glycoengineered cell lines and validated targeting constructs (knockout, knock-in, and mutated) including libraries for screening will become important community resources that will advance the glycoscience field and help disseminate and integrate glycosciences more broadly in biology. Large libraries of engineered isogenic cells with subtle differences of all types of glycosylation are available for dissection of glycan functions using different assays not limited to binding. Expanding these to organotypic tissue models is providing deeper insights. The ability to produce glycoproteins with a large variety of glycans opens up for unbiased testing of different glycoforms and determines the optimal design for therapeutic uses. Glycans can be custom designed, for example, to improve homogeneity, circulation time, targeting to select organs, or stimulating immunity.A word of caution, however: Whereas glycoengineering by knockout is fairly straightforward, there is still considerable work needed to establish methods to build robust complex glycosylation capabilities requiring multiple gene insertions in cells. Here, activation of endogenous genes in mammalian cells may provide a solution. Gene editing technologies caused a revolution in the glycoscience field, and we have only begun to see the new possibilities for manipulating glycosylation in cells and organisms and for exploiting glycoengineering in therapeutic glycoproteins and biologics.Finally, the well-established power and cost efficiency of using bacteria as reactors for production of proteins is now being harnessed to generate designer glycoproteins. There remains much to be explored in this rapidly developing area, but the potential is enormous.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Catherina Steenhoft and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Jenny Mortimer.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cummings.Several classes of successful commercial products are based on isolated or synthetic glycans or agents that alter their expression and recognition. This chapter summarizes the use of glycans as vaccines and therapeutics. Applications of glycan mimics as drugs are also discussed.Many well-known small-molecule drugs, such as antibiotics and anticancer therapeutic agents, are natural products that contain glycans as part of their core structure and/or as a sugar side chain (i.e., a glycoside). Some modern examples of natural products that bear glycan side chains are shown in Figure 57.1. The well-established area of natural product chemistry will not be reviewed in detail here, though many natural products are glycosylated such as the well-known digitalis. Modified glycans gave rise to synthetic drugs such as small-molecule inhibitors of influenza virus neuraminidase (see also Chapter 55). Recent advances in the functional understanding of carbohydrate–protein interactions have enabled the development of glycomimetics, a new class of small-molecule drugs that are briefly described.Examples of natural products that contain glycan components. Streptomycin and erythromycin A are antibiotics, doxorubicin is chemotherapeutic drug, and digoxin is used to treat cardiovascular disease. Influenza virus has two major surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (see Chapter 34). The hemagglutinin initiates infection by binding to cell-surface sialic acids. The neuraminidase assists virus release by cleaving sialic acids to prevent unwanted retention of newly synthesized virus on the cell surface. Neuraminidase may also function during the invasion phase by removing sialic acids on soluble mucins that would otherwise inhibit cell-surface binding. Because neuraminidase is essential to the viral life cycle, based on the crystal structure of the enzyme a rational drug design program yielded zanamivir (Relenza). The addition of a bulky guanidino side chain at C-4 of a previously known neuraminidase inhibitor, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, markedly increased the affinity for influenza neuraminidase, without affecting host-cell neuraminidases (Figure 57.2; see also Chapter 55). Relenza blocks the influenza virus life cycle by interrupting the spread of the virus during the early phase of an infection and subsequently preventing infection. Because of poor oral availability, Relenza has to be inhaled to work at the mucosal sites of infection in the upper airway. Because of the ease of use the orally available drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) achieves the same effects and has taken over most of the market.The synthetic influenza neuraminidase inhibitors Relenza and Tamiflu. The fear of avian influenza virus (“bird flu”) spreading into human populations has prompted stockpiling of Tamiflu. Fortunately, widespread use of the drug has not become necessary to date. The development of Tamiflu is a textbook example for rational glycan-based drug design resulting in a powerful drug against a devastating disease.Most biotherapeutic products are glycoproteins, including erythropoietin, various other cytokines, antibodies, glycosyltransferases, and glycosidases. This class of molecules sells in the tens of billions of U.S. dollars annually worldwide. Therapeutic glycoproteins or glycan-processing/recognizing proteins are typically produced recombinantly in cell culture systems or, less commonly, in the milk of transgenic animals. Control of glycosylation is of major importance during the development of these drugs, because their glycan chains have marked effects on stability, activity, antigenicity, and pharmacodynamics in intact organisms. Frequently, glycosylation must be optimized to ensure prolonged circulatory half-life in the blood. Manipulation of glycans to promote targeting to specific tissues and cell types has also been a useful element of drug design.Erythropoietin (EPO) is the most successful biotechnology product to date. It is a circulating cytokine that binds to the erythropoietin receptor, inducing proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. EPO was developed to treat anemias caused by bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy or lack of erythropoietin (e.g., renal failure). Natural and recombinant forms of erythropoietin carry three sialylated complex N-glycans and one sialylated O-glycan. Although in vitro the activity of deglycosylated erythropoietin is comparable to that of the fully glycosylated molecule, its activity in vivo is reduced by ∼90%, because poorly glycosylated EPO is rapidly cleared by filtration in the kidney. Undersialylated EPO is also rapidly cleared by galactose receptors in hepatocytes and macrophages (see Chapter 31). Fully sialylated chains and increased tetra-antennary branching reduce these problems and increase EPO activity in vivo nearly tenfold. Addition of an N-glycosylation site also increases half-life and activity in vivo. Covalently linking polyethylene glycol to the protein also reduces clearance by the kidney.Erythropoietin is unusual because it is small enough to be cleared by the kidney if it is underglycosylated. For most glycoprotein therapeutics, a more important consideration is minimizing clearance by galactose-binding hepatic receptors by ensuring full sialylation of glycans. Glycans greatly influence the efficacy of these drugs; therefore, controlling glycosylation during production is crucial considering regulatory requirements for batch-to-batch product consistency. Changes in culture pH, the availability of precursors and nutrients, and the presence or absence of various growth factors and hormones can each affect the extent of glycosylation, the degree of branching, and the completeness of sialylation. Sialidases and other glycosidases that are either secreted or released by dead cells can also degrade the previously intact product in the culture medium. These issues were hotly debated with the advent of “biosimilars” or generic versions of glycoproteins. The need to prove composition has fueled efforts devoted to glycan analysis and sequencing.Patenting new therapeutics is typically based on the composition of matter in the claimed molecule. Small molecules of defined structure and nonglycosylated proteins are easily captured in this manner. However, glycoproteins, especially those with multiple glycosylation sites, render it virtually impossible to obtain preparations that contain only a single glycoform. For examples of glycosylated therapeutics, please see Table 57.1. Thus, most biotherapeutic glycoproteins consist of a mixture of glycoforms. Licensing bodies allow for a certain range of variation in glycoforms and complexity of the mixture. However, the manufacturer and the agency must agree on the extent such variation is acceptable for a given drug formulation. Biopharmaceutical companies therefore spend considerable effort in assuring that their products fall within these defined ranges, once these are approved by licensing bodies. The inherent difficulty in reproducing complex glycoform mixtures also complicates efforts to make generic forms of recombinant glycoprotein drugs. Given the complexities of producing glycotherapeutic agents in mammalian cells, licensing agencies use consistency in glycoform composition as an indirect measure of the quality of process control in production. Glycosylation differences can have implications for the patentability of agents in which the polypeptide remains constant. Marked glycosylation differences have been used to define agents as being unique. However, it is usually necessary to show that the differences in glycosylation being claimed have a correspondingly significant effect in changing the functionality of the drug in question. The associated pharmaceutical licensing and legal issues are rapidly evolving to keep pace with scientific advances in this area.Examples of glycan-based drugs, their target diseases, and modes of action There are limits as to how much of a biotherapeutic glycoprotein an animal cell line can produce. Production becomes an issue in cases where very large amounts of a particular glycoprotein are needed. Glycoprotein production in plants or yeast is attractive but makes it necessary to eliminate risks arising from the nonhuman glycans of plant and fungal cells that could cause excessively rapid clearance and/or antigenic reactions. Many plant and yeast glycans are immunogenic and elicit glycan-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in humans when delivered parenterally. A variety of mammalian genes have been introduced into yeast and/or genes that are producing nonhuman glycosylation have been eliminated. Extensively engineered yeast strains are capable of producing biantennary N-linked glycans with the human sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) but the productivity of such yeast strains is often low. Efforts to engineer yeast to make human-like O-glycans are underway.Plants and algae as well as insect cell lines have also been used to engineer recombinant glycoproteins, but, as in yeast, the glycans produced by plants differ from those found in vertebrates. The antigenic differences that arise in recombinant glycoproteins produced in plants become less problematic if used for topical or oral administration, because humans are normally exposed to plant glycans in the diet. The cost of production is much lower than in animal cell culture systems and animal sera are not needed. As in yeast, “humanizing plants” with respect to glycosylation may allow the production of nonimmunogenic glycoproteins. Chemical methods for synthesizing entire glycoproteins from scratch have been developed and single glycoforms of EPO have been prepared by total synthesis. Given the complexity of glycoprotein synthesis, scale-up of these processes is challenging and an area of intense research activity (see Chapter 49).All monosaccharides needed for cellular glycan synthesis can be obtained from glucose through metabolic interconversions (see Chapter 4). Alternatively, monosaccharides can be derived from the diet or salvaged from degraded glycans. The relative contributions of different sources can vary with the cell type. For instance, even though all mammalian cells use sialic acid, only some contain high amounts of UDP-GlcNAc epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), which is required for the de novo synthesis of CMP-sialic acid. But sialic acid salvage from degraded glycans is quite efficient, decreasing the demand on the de novo pathway. Similarly, galactose, fucose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine can come from diet or be salvaged for glycan synthesis, whereas glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, and xylose cannot. All monosaccharides derived from diet or degraded glycans can be catabolized for energy, and, again, cells vary in their reliance on the different pathways.The variable contributions of these pathways are important for therapy of some diseases. Patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ib (CDG-Ib), who are deficient in phosphomannose isomerase, benefit greatly from oral mannose supplementation to bypass the insufficient supply of glucose-derived mannose 6-phosphate. A few CDG-IIc patients defective in fucose transporters have been treated with fucose to restore synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x on leukocytes (see Chapter 42). Some patients with Crohn\\'s disease show clinical improvement with oral N-acetylglucosamine supplementation, but the mechanism is unknown. Mice deficient in GNE activity have kidney failure, but providing N-acetylmannosamine in the diet prevents this outcome. Clinical trials using N-acetylmannosamine to treat GNE-deficient patients with hereditary inclusion body myopathy type II (HIBM-II) have been conducted but have yielded inconclusive results.Some monosaccharides and disaccharides can be toxic to humans who lack specific catabolizing enzymes. For example, people who lack fructoaldolase (aldolase B) accumulate fructose-1-phosphate, which ultimately causes ATP depletion and disrupts glycogen metabolism. Prolonged fructose exposure in these people can be fatal, and fructose-limited diets are critical. Deficiencies in the ability to metabolize galactose (see Chapter 4) are mostly due to a severe reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity and cause galactosemia. Although these patients are asymptomatic at birth, ingesting milk leads to vomiting and diarrhea, cataracts, hepatomegaly, and even neonatal death. Low-galactose or galactose-free diets can prevent these life-threatening symptoms. However, even these diets do not prevent unexplained long-term complications, which include speech and learning disabilities and ovarian failure in females with galactosemia.Infants hydrolyze lactose (Galβ1-4Glc) quite well, but the level of intestinal lactase catalyzing the breakdown of lactose can be much lower or absent in adults because of down-regulation of lactase gene expression after childhood. About two-thirds of the human population has lactase nonpersistence, making milk products a dietary annoyance. Unabsorbed lactose provides an osmotic load and is metabolized by colonic bacteria, causing diarrhea, abdominal bloating, flatulence, and nausea. Lactase persistence has evolved in certain pastoral populations from northwestern Europe, India, and Africa, allowing milk consumption in adult life. However, many adults either avoid lactose-containing foods or use lactase tablets to improve lactose digestion.The failure to turn over glycans by lysosomal degradation driven by a plethora of glycoside hydrolases causes serious problems for patients with lysosomal storage disorders. Deficiencies in individual lysosomal enzymes or their trafficking lead to pathological accumulation of their substrates in inclusion bodies inside the cells (see Chapter 41). One approach to treating these disorders is to inhibit initial glycan synthesis, a strategy termed substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Reduced synthesis of the initial compound decreases the load on the impaired enzyme, and some patients show significant clinical improvement. A small-molecule drug used for SRT is N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (or N-butyl-DNJ) (miglustat, Zavesca), which was approved in 2002 to treat Gaucher\\'s disease (glucocerebrosidase deficiency).Another approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders is enzyme replacement therapy. Unlike most therapeutic glycoproteins that interact with target receptors on the surface of cells, lysosomal enzymes developed for replacement therapy must be delivered intracellularly to lysosomes, their site of action. During the normal biosynthesis of lysosomal enzymes, their N-glycans become modified with mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues, which target them to lysosomes using Man-6-P receptors (see Chapter 30). The challenge for enzyme replacement therapy is to get the enzymes targeted properly to lysosomes, where they can degrade accumulated substrate. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher\\'s disease targets the lysosomes of macrophages via the cell-surface mannose receptor (see Chapter 31). The four recombinant enzyme products imiglucerase (approved in 1995), velaglucerase (approved in 2010), taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso, approved in 2012), and eliglustat (Cerdelga, approved in 2014) are marketed to treat Gaucher\\'s disease.The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry\\'s disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe\\'s disease. The replacement therapies clearly have beneficial effects and prolong life but are extremely expensive.A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Low-molecular-weight competitive inhibitors of some of these enzymes can act as “chaperones,” which stabilize the folded enzyme in the ER and effectively rescue the mutation and increase the steady state concentration of active enzyme in the lysosome. The dose of the inhibitor must be carefully adjusted to ensure that the inhibitory effects on enzyme function do not overshadow beneficial effects on folding. Only a low level of enzyme restoration is needed to significantly reduce the accumulation of undigested glycan substrates, indicating that lysosomal hydrolases are normally present in large catalytic excess.The use of purified glycans as therapeutics has received less attention than the development of glycoprotein-based treatments. Difficulties in establishing structure–activity relationships because of the large number of stereocenters and functional groups, undesirable pharmacokinetics of available formulations, poor oral absorption of the compounds, and low-affinity interactions with drug targets have limited their development. Some successful glycan drugs, such as the anticoagulant heparin, are given by injection, although efforts are under way to convert heparin into an orally absorbable form by complexing it with positively charged molecules. It may be possible to deliver other hydrophilic and/or negatively charged glycan drugs in this way to allow penetration of the intestinal barrier. Glycans are also sometimes attached to hydrophobic drugs to improve the drugs’ solubility and ability to cross biological membranes to enter cells and alter their pharmacokinetics.The anticoagulant heparin is, as discussed in Chapters 16, 43, and 46, one of the most widely prescribed drugs today. Heparin binds and activates antithrombin, a protease inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. Antithrombin activation leads to rapid inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa, shutting down the production of fibrin clots. Billions of doses of heparin (several metric tons) are produced by autodigestion of pig intestines, followed by graded fractionation of the products. Unfractionated heparin produces a variable anticoagulant response as it also binds to several plasma, platelet, and endothelial proteins. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins are derived from chemical or enzymatic cleavage of heparin to form smaller fragments. The pharmacological properties and the relative efficacy of the various LMW heparins are superior to those of unfractionated heparin and fewer secondary complications are reported. LMW heparins have replaced unfractionated heparins as therapeutic of choice in virtually all developed countries. In price-sensitive markets the unfractionated products are still heavily used. The preparation of recombinant heparin based on heparin biosynthesis enzymes is still under development. Arixtra, a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide that binds antithrombin exactly as isolated heparin is used to prevent deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and has gained market share in recent years even though it is more costly.To prevent excessive bleeding, rapid neutralization of heparin is desirable. Administration of the basic protein protamine, which binds to heparin, neutralizes its activity, and results in clearance of the complex by the kidney and liver. Heparin is also used to treat protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), likely working by competing for proinflammatory heparin-binding cytokines that trigger PLE in susceptible patients (see Chapter 43).Hyaluronan (see Chapter 15) is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan that is extensively used in surgical applications. Because of its viscoelastic properties, hyaluronan has lubricating and cushioning properties that have made it useful for protecting the corneal endothelium during ocular surgery. Hyaluronan is also useful in postsurgical wound healing. The mechanism of action is not well-understood, but may involve hyaluronan-binding proteins that mediate cell adhesion (see Chapter 15). Intra-articular injections of hyaluronan are used to treat knee and hip osteoarthritis. Modest improvement in patients treated with hyaluronan, may be the result of a mechanical (as a viscosupplement) and/or a biological (via signaling pathways) effect. Hyaluronan is used in very large quantities as a tissue filler in cosmetic medicine.“Glyconutrient” is a term used by the nutritional supplement industry to describe some of their products with wide-ranging claims concerning potential benefits. In most cases, these claims have not been substantiated through placebo-controlled, double-blind trials with defined, quantifiable outcomes. Much work is needed in this area to obtain insight into the potential role of dietary glycans on human health and to help consumers make informed decisions regarding their use.Mixtures of plant polysaccharides such as larch bark arabinogalactan and glucomannan are often termed “glyconutrients” that are claimed to contain “essential monosaccharides” needed for “cell communication.” Because all monosaccharides can be made in vivo from glucose (except in patients with rare genetic deficiencies; see Chapter 42), none of the other monosaccharides are actually known to be “essential.” Moreover, arabinogalactan and glucomannan are not degraded to available monosaccharides in the stomach or small intestine. Instead, anaerobic bacteria in the colon metabolize them and produce short-chain fatty acids. No peer-reviewed clinical studies support the efficacy of such “glyconutrients” for any disease or condition. Nevertheless, the following examples demonstrate how dietary glycans might have beneficial effects.Glucosamine (often mixed with chondroitin sulfate) has been promoted to relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis, which involves the age-dependent erosion of articular cartilage. Cartilage provides a cushion between the bones to minimize mechanical damage, and a net loss of cartilage occurs when the degradation rate exceeds the synthetic rate. Claims that glucosamine improves osteoarthritis symptoms and restores partially the structure of the eroded cushion in the knees are controversial. Superficially, this would seem to make sense, because primary glycans of cartilage include hyaluronan (see Chapter 15) and chondroitin sulfate, both of which contain hexosamines within their structure (see Chapter 16). Nevertheless, veterinarians report positive results after treating animals with glucosamine for more than two decades.Positive effects of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis are not well-documented. It remains unclear how the acidic chondroitin sulfate polymer can be absorbed and delivered to its proposed site of action.Some studies suggest that chewing gum containing sugar alditols, such as xylitol and sorbitol, can help control the development of dental caries. The benefit of these reduced sugars seems to be based on stimulation of salivary flow and an antimicrobial effect by inhibiting a glucosyltransferase that blocks glucose utilization by Streptococcus mutans. Xylitol also inhibits the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages and inhibits the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the suspected causes of periodontal disease.Human milk contains ∼70 g/L of lactose and 5–10 g/L of free oligosaccharides. More than 130 different glycan species have been identified with lactose at the reducing end, including poly-N-acetyllactosamine units. Some glycans are α2-3- and/or α2-6-sialylated and/or fucosylated in α1-2, α1-3, and/or α1-4 linkages. In contrast, bovine milk, the typical mainstay in human infant formulas, contains much smaller amounts of fucose oligosaccharides. These differences may account for some of the physiological advantages seen for breastfed versus formula-fed infants. The glycans may also favor growth of a nonpathogenic bifidogenic microflora and/or block pathogen adhesion that causes infections and diarrhea. Surprisingly, a substantial number of human milk oligosaccharides remain almost undigested in the infant\\'s intestine and are excreted intact into the urine. Whether supplementing infant formula with specific, biologically active free glycans enhances infant health is unknown.Polysaccharide vaccines consisting solely of glycan components typically elicit poor immunity, especially in infants. Since glycans are T-cell-independent antigens they do not effectively stimulate T-helper-dependent activation and class switching of B-cell-mediated immunity. Conjugate vaccines consisting of glycans coupled to carrier proteins have proven to be highly effective. Three major conjugate vaccines are marketed today: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) causes an acute lower respiratory infection among young children that constitute a high-risk group for H. influenzae type B infections. Consequently, the Hib polysaccharide vaccine introduced in 1985 was withdrawn from the market in 1988 and replaced by capsular polysaccharide (CPS-)protein conjugate vaccine formulations. A conjugated form of a Hib-derived oligosaccharide coupled to a protein carrier is part of routine vaccination schedules and has been so successful that infectious diseases caused by this bacterium are nearly eradicated in vaccinated populations. The first semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccine QuimiHib marketed in Cuba contains glycan chains with an average length of 16 monosaccharide residues. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been developed to cover an increasing number of serotypes, and current formulations are 10- (Synflorix, GlaxoSmithKline) and 13-valent (Prevnar13, Pfizer). Prevnar 13 provides protection against serotypes that account for >70% of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease worldwide and is the best-selling vaccine with revenues of six billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Conjugate vaccines to protect from Neisseria meningitides are also very successful on the market. Because of the fast onset and rapid progression of meningococcal infections, vaccination is required to protect against this disease. Several conjugated CPS vaccines are licensed in different parts of the world: The tetravalent serogroup A, C, W, and Y (Menactra, Menveo, and Nimenrix) and a few monovalent vaccines based on serogroup C CPS (Meningitec, Menjugate, NeisVac-C). Two combination vaccines for N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b (Hib) are available against meningococcal serogroups C/Y (MenHibrix) and against meningococcal serogroup C (Menitorix). A monovalent serogroup A vaccine (MenAfriVac) is widely used in the sub-Saharan meningitis belt of Africa.Currently, several new vaccines based on synthetic oligosaccharide antigens are being developed to protect children and the elderly from a variety of bacterial infections. Vaccines to protect from hospital acquired infections caused by Clostridium difficile and Klebsiella pneumoniae that are increasingly antibiotic resistant are in preclinical evaluation.Several carbohydrate-based cancer vaccines are at different stages of development to treat cancer. Ganglioside immunogens present on certain types of cancer cells such as gangliosides GM2 and GD2 in melanomas and Globo H in breast cancer are being explored. Treatment strategies targeting the shorter glycan sequences such as sialyl-Tn (sialylα2-6GalNAcα-) found on cancer mucins (see Chapter 44) have seen little progress in 20 years. The synthetic Globo H hexasaccharide (see Figure 57.1) resembling the breast and prostate cancer antigen reached Phase 3 clinical trials but failed to gain marketing approval. Further human clinical trials are ongoing. Instead of active immunization of immunocompromised patients, the use of humanized anti-glycan antibodies (passive immunization) is now explored in preclinical evaluations.As discussed in Chapter 34, many microbes and toxins bind to mammalian tissues by recognizing specific glycan ligands. Thus, small soluble glycans or glycan mimetics can be used to block the initial attachment of microbes and toxins to cell surfaces (or block their release), and thus prevent or suppress infection. Because many of these organisms naturally gain access through the airways or gut, the glycan-based drugs can be delivered directly without being distributed systemically. Milk oligosaccharides are natural antagonists of intestinal infection in infants (see above). Glycosylated polymers block the binding of viruses such as influenza. Although backed by a strong scientific rationale and robust in vitro studies, such “antiadhesive” or “mimicry” therapies have not yet found much practical application.When specific glycan-protein interactions are responsible for selective cell–cell interactions and a resulting pathology, then administration of small-molecule glycomimetics of the natural ligand is a useful means of intervention. Selectin-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and other leukocytes into sites of inflammation or ischemia/reperfusion injury involves specific selectin–glycan interactions in the vascular system (see Chapters 31 and 46). The use of sialyl-Lewis x tetrasaccharide derivatives failed because of poor oral availability and a short serum half-life. Glycomimetics that preserve the essential functionality of the parent tetrasaccharide but eliminate unwanted polar functional groups and synthetically cumbersome glycan components have been successful. The design of a monosaccharide glycomimetic starting from sialyl-Lewis x is shown in Figure 57.3. First, the sialic acid residue was replaced with a charged glycolic acid group, the N-acetylglucosamine residue was then replaced with an ethylene glycol linker, and finally the galactose residue was replaced with a linker moiety. The resulting glycomimetic had E-selectin binding affinity comparable to sialyl-Lewis x.Glycomimetic E-selectin inhibitors based on sialyl-Lewis x. GMI-1070, targeting E-, P-, and L-selectin, yielded unconvincing results in Phase 3 clinical trials as a treatment for sickle cell crisis and is under further investigation.A variety of glycans, including the classical A and B blood group determinants, can act as barriers to blood transfusion and transplantation of organs (Chapters 13 and 46). Rejection of mismatched blood or organs occurs because hosts have a high titer of preexisting antibodies against the glycan epitopes, presumably as a prior reaction to related structures found on bacteria or other microbes. In the case of the ABO blood groups, incompatibility is routinely managed by blood and tissue typing and finding an appropriate donor for the recipient. Bacterial enzymes can be used in vitro to remove the A and B blood group determinants from A and B red cells, converting them into “universal donor” O red cells.A related problem is found in xenotransplantation (i.e., the transplantation of organs between species), which is actively being pursued as a solution for the shortage of human organs for patients. The animal donors of preference are pigs, because many porcine organs resemble those of humans in size, physiology, and anatomy. However, unlike humans and certain other primates, pigs and most other mammals produce the terminal “α-Gal” epitope on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Because humans have naturally occurring high-titer antibodies in blood directed toward this epitope, this results in hyperacute rejection of porcine organ transplants, via reaction of the antibodies with endothelial cells of blood vessels. Attempts to prevent this reaction, include blood filtration over glycan affinity columns to remove xenoreactive antibodies and blockade of the interaction by infusing soluble competing oligosaccharides. Transgenic pigs lacking the reactive epitope have also been produced, as have animals with an excess of complement-controlling proteins on their cell surfaces. Pig organs also have high levels of the nonhuman sialic acid (Neu5Gc), against which most humans have antibodies. Even if this problem is solved, there are other glycan and protein structural differences between humans and pigs that cause later stages of graft rejection, thus necessitating immunosuppression.The authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Morten Thaysen-Andersen.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.58Martina Delbianco, Benjamin G. Davis, and Peter H. Seeberger.Nanomaterials offer tunable chemical and physical properties, such as electronic, photonic, and magnetic properties. Decoration of nanomaterials with glycans increases solubility and biocompatibility and lowers cytotoxicity, while allowing for multivalent glycan presentation. Given the central role of multivalency in glycobiology, glycosylated nanomaterials are interesting probes to study cellular, tissue, and organismal interactions. Nanomaterials purely composed of glycans, such as polysaccharide nanoparticles or nanocrystals, are interesting imaging agents, drug delivery systems, and tissue scaffolds that illustrate the potential of glycans in nanotechnology.Glycoproteins and glycolipids are natural glycoconjugates that take part in cellular communication, inflammation, and immune response using carbohydrate–protein or carbohydrate–carbohydrate interactions. Certain glycan sequences are characteristic markers of diseases such as cancer, asthma, and diabetes. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms requires tools that mimic the presentation of glycans on the cell surface.Individual protein–carbohydrate interactions are often of low affinity and broad specificity, complicating the description of glycan function. Nature enhances specificity by utilizing multivalent interactions. The number and the presentation of carbohydrate residues on a biomolecule are major determinants of binding avidity of ligands to cell-surface receptors. The transition from monovalent to multivalent is often associated with a larger variation in affinity/avidity, suggesting a “thresholding” effect, and in some cases cooperativity.To elucidate those mechanisms, glycans have to be displayed in a scenario closer to that found on the cellular scale. “Nanotechnology” moves from the angstrom to the nanometer range (from ∼10−10 to ∼10−7 m), offering the tools to create, manipulate, and characterize structures on those scales.Large glycoconjugates bearing multiple copies of a carbohydrate on various scaffolds, such as glycodendrimers or glycopolymers, have been generated to probe carbohydrate–protein interactions. Several glyconanomaterials with inherent high surface/volume ratios have been developed to allow for a greater contact surface area and explore multivalency effects. The integration of nanomaterials in the glycosciences has already enabled biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems, imaging agents, diagnostic platforms, or precise sensing tools that operate through biological mimicry. Further cooperation between the glycosciences and nanotechnology will improve our understanding of glycobiology.Glyconanomaterials based on metal particles, semiconductors, or carbon-based scaffolds take advantage of the unique physical properties of the nanoscale, such as catalytic, photonic, electronic, or magnetic properties that are not seen in the bulk. The glycan portion ensures water solubility, exceptional stability in water and biological buffers, biocompatibility, structural diversity, and passive and active targeting properties. As a result, biocompatible nanomaterials offering a multivalent glycan presentation are generated` for sensing and drug delivery applications.Nanoformulations, exclusively based on polysaccharides, have been developed as well. Polysaccharides such as chitosan, dextran, hyaluronic acid, and heparin have given rise to polysaccharide-based nanoparticles (NPs) for pharmaceutical use with superior biocompatibility and biodegradability. Low toxicity, low cost, and easy chemical modifications are additional advantages of polysaccharide-based NPs compared to synthetic polymers. These glyconanomaterials are currently used for drug delivery and tissue engineering, and electronics and device applications are emerging.Hybrid materials based on inorganic nanostructures and biomolecules are a major focus of nanotechnology. Iron oxide, noble metal, and semiconductor nanoparticles served as synthetic scaffolds to multimerize glycans and enhance the affinity for receptors (Figure 58.1). The physical properties, such as magnetism or fluorescence, of these hybrid materials have given rise to applications in sensing, delivery, and imaging.Overview of different types of glyconanomaterials created by coupling glycans to the surface of diverse nanomaterials. The unique optoelectronic properties and facile chemical modification make gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) an important tool to monitor biological binding events. The functionalization of AuNPs with glycans generates materials with high aqueous solubility/dispersibility and biocompatibility. The resonance between collective oscillations of electrons in AuNPs (plasmons) and the incident electromagnetic radiation, gives rise to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Resonance frequencies of gold surface plasmon bands lie in the visible region (400–750 nm), giving rise to color effects. The high surface area/volume ratio results in high LSPR sensitivity and colorimetric changes, making AuNPs extremely valuable analytical reporters.AuNPs are produced by reduction of gold salts with sodium citrate and surface modification with “capping” agents. Size, shape, and morphology are tuned by adjusting reaction conditions, allowing access to the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. Colorimetric carbohydrate–lectin analyses exploiting LSPR of AuNPs have typically used 10-nm particles capped with thiol-poly(ethylene glycol) (thiol-PEG) aldehydes decorated with simple mono- or disaccharides. AuNPs Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120) or cholera toxin induced a reversible color change.Direct visualization is a particularly attractive feature in biology. Stable colloidal gold was first described by Faraday in 1857, but applied in biology only in the 1970s when immunogold-staining procedures were used to observe microorganisms by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Immunogold staining with mannosylated AuNPs permitted users to probe complement activation and opsonization processes in macrophage-mediated endocytosis. Carbohydrate–protein interactions were visualized by TEM thanks to the mannosylated AuNPs ability to target Escherichia coli type 1 pili mannose-specific receptors.Very small gold glyconanoparticles can be prepared by reducing a gold salt in the presence of glycosylated thiol ligands (Figure 58.2). Ligand density and composition can be adjusted precisely. These glyconanoparticles conserve the chemical properties of the ligands and can be advantageously characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), TEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).(Left) A calculated representation of a 2-nm-sized gold glyconanoparticle formed by 102 gold atoms and coated with 44 molecules of 5-mercaptopentyl α-D-mannopyranoside and (right) the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image. (more...)The smaller glyco-clusters lack a LSPR band, but can be observed by TEM. Visualization of AuNPs helped to unambiguously demonstrate some weak, previously controversial, effects. For example, Lex-decorated AuNPs provided visual evidence for the existence of Ca-mediated sugar–sugar interactions and were used to explore potential mechanisms of sugar-mediated self-assembly of sponge cells.Small gold glyconanoparticles were helpful in clarifying mechanistic aspects of multivalent carbohydrate recognition and have been exploited as antiadhesion agents to prevent melanoma metastasis, as vaccine candidates, and for cellular and molecular imaging.Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), including iron oxide and manganese oxide nanoparticles, are interesting contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI can generate internal tomographic tissue images by using a radio frequency (RF)-induced electromagnetic field; modulation of that field\\'s signal by MNPs (so-called “contrast”) helps to detect their location. In clinical practice, gadolinium complexes are commonly used as MRI “contrast” agents. MNP–biomolecule hybrids are typically more sensitive, as they can be loaded with multiple copies of the same ligand for better receptor targeting. Multimodal imaging can be achieved by attaching labels (i.e., a fluorescent dye) that allow for additional detection modes.The surface functionalization of MNPs is crucial for molecule-specific binding and “molecular MRI.” Antibodies have been widely used as targeting ligands because of their superb specificity, but suffer from high cost, short lifetime due to thermal instability, and potential immunogenicity. Structurally defined ligands, such as glycans, provide an attractive alternative.Glyco-MNPs allow for detection of early stage disease by successfully mimicking leukocyte recruitment during inflammation (see Figure 58.2). By taking advantage of their high surface/volume ratio, glyco-MNPs can display multiple copies of oligosaccharides, thus increasing multivalency of binding interactions. Tetrasaccharide sialyl-Lewis x (SLex)-functionalized MNPs successfully targeted E-/P-selectins. Notably, SLex-MNPs detected inflammation events, both in vitro and in vivo, without any significant signs of associated cytotoxicity. Specific binding to the activated endothelium of blood vessels allowed for the detection of lesions in clinically relevant brain mouse models of stroke (Figure 58.3). Cross-species efficacy is easier to achieve with sugars than with antibody ligands. Thus, glyco-MNPs may be translated more readily from mammalian models to the clinic.(A) In vitro binding studies using SLex-MNPs to rat E-selectin; (B) magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and their 3D reconstruction of SLex magnetic nanoparticles. (Adapted from van Kasteren SI, et al. 2009. Proc Natl Acad Sci106: 18−23.) Quantum dots (QDs) are luminescent semiconducting nanomaterials, typically made of binary cadmium or zinc selenides or sulfides. QDs can emit light in the entire spectrum, and their optical properties are tunable depending on their size. Compared with organic dyes, QDs also have a broader excitation spectrum and sharper emission bands, allowing for multicomponent analysis with a single excitation source. Glyco-QDs functionalized with carboxymethyldextran and polylysine were used to study carbohydrate–protein interactions. The addition of maltose-modified dendrimers rendered the QDs water-soluble and biocompatible, while enhancing stability.Using a host–guest strategy, β-cyclodextrin-quantum dots (β-CD-QDs) were prepared. Synthetic β-CD-QDs behaved much like PEGylated QDs and agglutinated lectins such as ConA, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), and peanut agglutinin (PNA).Elemental carbon has several allotropes, including tetravalent diamond and trivalent graphitic structures, which provide potential scaffolds for glycan presentation. Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope and the basic structure of important carbon-based materials. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is a discrete spherical construct that, although larger than many small molecules, can be manipulated using techniques common to small molecules. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be considered cylindrical, elongated fullerenes. As a consequence of their curvature, hybridization, and boundary/inner atom ratios, both fullerenes and CNTs possess different reactivity that other carbon allotropes.Glycosylated-fullerenes such as α-D-mannosyl fullerenes and fullerenols inhibit erythrocyte aggregation. These “sugar balls” are generated by introduction of a reactive group, such as a terminal alkyne, followed by attachment of azido sugars. Thereby, a near-spherical display of glycans is possible. The glycosylated C60s with 0.7-nm diameter can be considered the smallest “nanoparticles” in glyconanotechnology.CNTs are classified based on the number of graphene-like sheets that make up the sidewalls of the cylinder. Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) have a typical diameter of 1–2 nm and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) have diameters of ∼2–25 nm. The CNT length can range from 10s of nanometers to 10s of micrometers or even longer. Both the inner hollow space and the outer surface may be exploited to create functionalized CNTs (f-CNTs) to serve as delivery systems.Broader use of CNTs has been hampered by their cytotoxicity and poor solubility. CNTs have been coated with glycopolymers. A C18-lipid tail “wrapped” the CNT surface through hydrophobic interaction, to expose α-GalNAc residues. Glycopolymer-coated CNTs were nontoxic in vitro, whereas noncoated CNTs induced death in certain cells. Noncovalent functionalized CNTs have the risk of losing their coating materials once introduced into a biological milieu, and the ultimate fate of such products is unclear.Covalent surface glycosylation or glycoconjugation of CNTs creates more stable probes for in vivo studies. Oxidation of the CNT surface introduces carboxylic acids that can be used for the covalent attachment of amino-functionalized sugars. Galactosylated SWCNTs can “capture” pathogenic E. coli. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show a strongly bound matrix formed by cells binding to the glycosylated nanotubes.Direct attachment of β-GlcNAc residues via “one-pot” Staudinger reduction and amidation allows for good control of the anomeric configuration. Upon monosaccharide attachment, glycosyltransferases were used for regio- and stereoselective glycan elaboration. The sugar hydroxyl groups were used as “tagging” sites for heavy element-bearing labels to visualize the glycans via TEM.1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition of reactive azomethine ylides, generated in situ from α-amino acids, created pyrrolidine derivatives of fullerenes and CNTs. This covalent approach avoided oxidative “cutting” and provided filled-and-functionalized glycosylated CNTs for in vivo applications.CNTs can be considered “1D hollow pores” with an associated capillarity. Through capillary action, molten salts or their solutions can be encapsulated inside CNTs. Glyco-CNTs were used for encapsulation of the radioemitter Na125I and in vivo localization of high levels of this radionuclide. Multiple copies of GlcNAc improved both water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Thanks to the high aspect ratio and surface area to volume ratio of such CNTs, sugars can be efficiently displayed in a multivalent format (Figure 58.4). These glyco-CNTs are alternative radiotracers for in vivo imaging or radiation-delivery systems with high radioisotope-loading capacity and high sensitivity. The rapid uptake of iodide by the mammalian thyroid served as a test of any potential leakage of radioactive iodide “cargo.” Although “free” iodide 125I rapidly entered the thyroid, iodide encapsulated in the glyco-CNT remained at its target site even after a month.In vivo localization of filled-and-functionalized glyco-single-walled nanotubules (SWNTs). (TH) thyroid, (LU) lungs, (ST) stomach, (LI) liver, (KI) kidney, (BL) bladder. (Adapted from Hong SY, et al. 2010. Nat Mater9: 485−490.) The chemical flexibility of graphene-based materials allowed for the formation of dynamic supramolecular constructs. A carbohydrate-functionalized two-dimensional (2D) surface was prepared by decorating thermally reduced graphene sheets with multivalent sugar ligands. Host–guest inclusion provided a versatile strategy to present biofunctional ligands on the carbon surface. The multivalent sugar-functionalized graphene sheet agglutinates bacteria and inhibits their motility. Taking advantage of the supramolecular design, the captured bacteria can be partially released by adding a competitive guest. The unique thermal IR-absorption properties of graphene allow for the killing of the captured bacteria by IR-laser irradiation of the captured graphene–sugar–E. coli complex.Dendrimers are nanosized branched compounds that can be decorated with ligands, permitting control over their number and orientation. Several scaffolds based on organic molecules, metal complexes, and supramolecular assemblies have been exploited for the formation of multivalent glycodendrimers to study lectin-binding properties. “Click” chemistry and amide bond formation have been used to tether sugar molecules to the dendrimer scaffold. Mannose-conjugated glycodendrimers bind specifically to ConA. Galactose functionalized dendrimeric arms have been conjugated to β-cyclodextrin (βCD). The βCD can incorporate either a drug, such as doxorubicin, or a fluorescent dye, to monitor the uptake of the dendrimeric structure. Specific delivery of doxorubicin to hepatocytes was achieved with the help of targeting galactose units.Metal complexes like Ru(bpy)3 were also employed as scaffold for the assembly of three-dimensional supramolecular glycodendrimers. βCDs decorated with seven mannose functional groups were bound, via hydrophobic interactions, to the ruthenium core appended with adamantyl groups. The resulting supramolecular assemblies bind E. coli that express mannose receptors in the bacterial pili.Supramolecular glycodendrimers have been prepared to display carbohydrates in a defined manner, offering controlled multivalency. Supramolecular particles, vesicles, or fibers have been created, offering a dynamic representation of a biological system. Synthetic molecules that mimic glycolipids self-assembled into nanovesicles displaying oligomannosides on their outer surface, resembling the glycocalyx coating of eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. The supramolecular approach permitted the formation of raft-like nanomorphologies on the synthetic vesicle that could shine light on important binding mechanisms.Glycodendrimers can also be combined with particles to create multiple levels of multivalency. In one example, glycodendrimers displayed on protein-derived particles (virus-like particles) allowed for picomolar inhibition of Ebola virus–related adhesion events.Natural polysaccharides are very useful for the preparation of nanosized carriers. The low toxicity, biocompatibility, stability, low cost, hydrophilic nature, and availability of reactive sites for chemical modification render polysaccharides attractive building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. Polysaccharides can be used as NP backbone or coating. Polysaccharide-based nanoparticles are prepared by covalent or ionic cross-linking, polyelectrolyte complexation, or self-assembly of hydrophobically modified polysaccharides.Chitosan-based NPs are common drug delivery systems. Positively charged chitosan gives rise to ionic cross-linked particles with polyanions to deliver proteins, oligonucleotides, and plasmid DNA. Multifunctional chitosan NPs, incorporating a NIR fluorophore for fluorescence imaging, can encapsulate anticancer drugs or complex small interfering RNA (siRNA) for sequential drug delivery. Hyaluronic acid and heparin-based NPs are promising platforms in cancer therapy; unlike chitosan NPs, they display inherent targeting properties. Hyaluronic acid binds to CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many types of cancer. This targeting property has promoted the application of hyaluronic acid-based NPs as theranostic agents.Polysaccharides have also been used to coat polymeric or metallic nanoparticles, improving their water solubility, stability, and long-term circulation. Chitosan-PEG-coated iron oxide NPs improve intracellular delivery of a DNA repair inhibitor (O6-benzylguanine) to glioblastoma multiform cells and enable treatment monitoring by MRI. Dextran was also employed to increase the water solubility and stability of iron oxide MNPs. Sulfated dextran electrostatically interacts with positively charged polycations. Functionalization of dextran-coated iron oxide NPs with sLex tetrasaccharide helped to monitor inflammation events in mouse brains in vivo. Hyaluronic acid–coated superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs have been used for imaging and for drug delivery to cancer cells.Nanocarriers based on heparin and heparin derivatives have been applied to combat cancer via targeted, magnetic, photodynamic, and gene therapy. Gold and magnetic NPs have been coated or modified with heparin to improve their biocompatibility for applications in heparin-mediated events. Polysaccharide-functionalized gold NPs have given rise to multifunctional NPs with a wide range of applications including imaging, photodynamic therapy, and induction of apoptosis of metastatic cells.Because of their natural abundance, nanomaterials based on cellulose have become extremely popular, offering biocompatibility, easy surface functionalization, and outstanding mechanical properties. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are rod-like particles obtained on acid hydrolysis of cellulose fibers. Because of their stiffness, twist, and aspect ratio, CNCs can assemble into chiral nematic phases, resulting in iridescent colors. Applications include functional paper, optoelectronics, engineered tissues, drug delivery, and biosensors.Glycans are suitable biomarkers for medical diagnostics. Glyconanotechnology aids the development of biosensors and methods for the detection of glycans, lectins, or cancer cells and pathogens. Nanoengineered glycan sensors may help glycoprotein profiling, avoiding labeling or glycan liberation steps. A variety of nanomaterials are being explored as specific probes for label-free lectin or glycan detection. AuNPs and CNTs are the most widely used nanomaterials. Nanoengineered materials can be detected by mass changes with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and cantilever sensors, by field-effect transistor (FET) sensors based on carbon nanotubes, or optical sensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in combination with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of glycans or lectins.Cancer cells and pathogens can be detected using glyconanomaterials. Glycan-functionalized nanodiamonds functioned as cross-linkers for bacteria and permitted water decontamination by filtration of the resulting aggregates through a 10-mm membrane. Mannan-coated gold glyconanoparticles incubated with a human gastric cell line in the presence of the mannose-binding lectin ConA detect and quantify cell-surface mannose glycans and silver signal amplification. The specific detection of cancer cells requires further refinement of the system, such as the substitution of ConA by a panel of lectins that recognize aberrant glycosylation specific to cancer.The translation of biomolecular binding events into nanomechanics using a nanosized cantilever array of mannosides was applied to detect and discriminate different strains of E. coli. Methods exploiting intrinsic optical properties can be explored for biomedical “nonlabeled” imaging applications. QDs and AuNPs allow for spectral tuning, whereas SWCNTs show characteristic Raman peaks as well as photoluminescence in the NIR range. These intrinsic properties have yet to be systematically explored in vivo, but hold significant potential.Glyconanomaterials based on different glycan-coated scaffolds have been created. Given the specific roles of endogenous glycoconjugates, nanomaterials that display glycans on similar length scales provide chemical platforms to advance our understanding of carbohydrate-mediated biological events.Tailored glycomaterials that resemble more closely natural systems are under development to uncover hidden biological mechanisms. The challenge is now to create functional structures based on the appropriate scaffold and combine it with the proper glycan. Systems with increased control on the glycan presentation (i.e., spacing and conformation) is the next goal. At the same time, more complex glycans need to be incorporated into glyconanomaterials. Given the many functions carbohydrates in Nature, the glyconanotechnology field should evolve from simple binding studies involving the prototypical mannose-concanavalin A interaction to the exploration of new and more relevant avenues.By taking advantage of the physical properties and inducible sizes, translation of fundamental studies to biomedical glyconanotechnology appears to be imminent. Promising examples include the use of glycomaterials for pathogen detection and as diagnostic tools. Biomedical imaging, using multimodal imaging techniques, such as PET/MRI or fluorescence/MRI, is an attractive vision for using glyco-NPs. Still, much effort has to be put to improve glycan stability in biological samples. Glycomimetics offer an interesting approach to avoid enzymatic degradation.Polysaccharide-based materials are a green alternative to petroleum-based chemicals. A better molecular level understanding of these materials will fuel their application in biotechnology, as tissue scaffolds or nanoformulation for drug delivery. Polysaccharides are major component of the extracellular matrix, playing important roles in cellular communication and evolution. Being able to reproduce these complex natural environments will be game changing for tissue engineering.The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Soledad Penades and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Sriram Neelamegham.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Darvill, Kamil Godula, Breeanna Urbanowicz, and Debra Mohnen.Plants provide large amounts of glycans that are used by humans for many purposes. Wood, which is composed predominantly of lignified secondary walls, is used as an energy source, as a building material, and for papermaking. Pectins isolated from the primary cell walls of fruits and polysaccharides isolated from seeds are used as thickeners, stabilizers, and gelling agents in many foods and beverages. Plant cell walls are the major component of forage used as animal feed. These walls, as dietary fiber, also contribute to human health. Recent concerns about the environmental costs of fossil fuel extraction and consumption have led to renewed interest in using plant glycans as feedstocks for energy production, for the generation of polymers with improved or new functionalities, and for the generation of high-value chemical precursors. In this chapter, we briefly describe four broad categories—bioenergy, fine chemicals and chemical feedstocks, polymeric materials, and nanomaterials—in which plant glycans have the potential to replace or to provide alternatives to petroleum-based products.Plant glycans are used by humans as an energy source, as a building material, and for making numerous bioproducts including paper. Cellulose from diverse plant sources is the primary component of many valuable materials, including textiles and plastics. Pectins are used as thickeners, stabilizers, and gelling agents in many foods and beverages. Plant cell walls are used as animal feed and, as dietary fiber, also contribute to human health. The well-established adverse effects of the extraction and use of fossil fuels on the Earth\\'s climate have led to worldwide efforts to develop plant-derived glycans as a renewable raw material to displace or supplement fossil fuels for energy production, for the generation of polymers with improved or new functionalities, and for the generation of high-value chemical precursors.The process of photosynthesis by terrestrial plants has been estimated to assimilate at least 100 billion metric tons of CO2 annually. The chemical energy generated in this manner is stored predominantly in the form of carbohydrates. Some of these carbohydrates are used directly for plant growth and development, whereas others are converted to storage polysaccharides (starch and fructans) that provide plants with a readily available form of energy. A considerable portion of the carbohydrate formed via photosynthesis is used to produce the polysaccharide-rich walls that surround plant cells (Chapter 24). Thus, plant cell walls account for a substantial amount of biological carbon sequestration and are a potentially sustainable and economical source of nonpetroleum-based energy and high-value chemicals.First-generation bioethanol produced by fermenting the starch present in corn grains currently accounts for virtually all of the liquid transportation fuel generated from plant materials in the United States. The starch is first treated with enzymes that convert it to glucose, which is then fermented to ethanol and carbon dioxide by adding yeast. Yeast can convert 1 kg of glucose to 0.33 gallons (1.25 L) of ethanol and an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The United States and Brazil together account for as much as 84% of world ethanol production (https://afdc.energy.gov/). In 2019, 16.9 billion gallons (64 billion liters) of ethanol were produced in the United States according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (www.eia.gov). Brazil produces approximately 8.57 billion gallons (32 billion liters) of ethanol annually by fermenting the sucrose extracted from sugarcane (https://afdc.energy.gov/). Corn and cane bioethanol are then blended with gasoline in varying amounts or used directly as a transportation fuel.Concerns about the negative impacts of the large-scale production of corn-based ethanol on food production and the environment has led to renewed interest in generating ethanol and other liquid transportation fuels from sustainable plant lignocellulosic biomass that can be grown on marginal land. This biomass is comprised predominantly of lignified secondary walls (Chapter 24) that are composed of cellulose (40%–50% w/w), hemicellulose (25%–30% w/w), and lignin (15%–25% w/w) and lesser amounts of pectin and protein. Several different plants, including poplar, switchgrass, sorghum, miscanthus, eucalyptus, and sugarcane, are being considered for use as bioenergy crops.The biomass from energy crops can be converted to liquid fuel by fermentation or gasification. In gasification, the biomass is heated in a low-oxygen environment to generate syngas (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide) and heat. The syngas can then be reacted to produce diverse chemicals including alcohols or alkanes via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis that can be further transformed into fuels (mainly diesel oil and jet fuel). Most of the technical challenges to commercial biomass gasification are understood. However, the process has not been widely adopted because of the high capital costs involved.The generation of liquid fuel from lignocellulose by fermentation currently involves using a cocktail of enzymes to convert the biomass to sugar, which is then fermented to give the desired product. This approach may be superseded by the development of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) technologies in which the microorganism that deconstructs plant biomass into sugars also converts those same sugars into products such as fuels and chemicals. The fermentation approach is simple in concept but there are many technical challenges that must be solved before it becomes commercially viable. One major obstacle is that the cellulose and hemicellulose in lignocellulosic biomass are not readily accessible to hydrolytic enzymes and thus are not efficiently converted to fermentable sugars. The biomass must be pretreated with dilute acid, ammonia, or steam to decrease this recalcitrance. Cost-effective and environmentally sound pretreatment technologies need to be developed if the commercial production of bioproducts by fermentation is to become a reality. The efficiency of the enzymes used to convert the cellulose and hemicellulose to sugar must also be improved. To this end there is extensive ongoing research to engineer thermophilic microorganisms to more efficiently deconstruct biomass and to convert the released sugars to the desired product, avoiding the necessity of releasing sugars from the biomass with enzyme cocktails before fermentation.Increased understanding of cell wall structure, together with knowledge of polysaccharide and lignin biosynthesis, is expected to facilitate the engineering of plants to produce biomass that is more amenable to bioprocessing and an improved resource for biofuel, value-added chemicals, and bioproducts. However, the susceptibility of such modified plants to biotic and abiotic stress in the field will need to be addressed. Such concerns, together with those regarding the introduction of genetically modified plants into the environment, may be lessened by identifying natural plant variants that produce lignocellulosic biomass with the desired properties including reduced recalcitrance to saccharification.Lignin is poised to become a major by-product of commercial biorefineries, as it is not converted to a liquid fuel during fermentation. Early concepts of biorefineries envisioned burning the lignin to generate power. However, there is now a greater emphasis on valorization of the recovered lignin to produce value-added compounds for the chemical industry. Considerable resources are being allocated to research and development worldwide to create a viable and sustainable lignocellulosic advanced biofuels and bioproducts industry. Nevertheless, many technical, environmental, and societal challenges must be solved if this industry is to develop and contribute to a biobased economy and to reduce the demand for fossil fuels.Several of the sugars released from lignocellulosic biomass, including glucose and xylose, are being investigated for use in the production of functional chemical precursors that can be used to make industrially relevant compounds and polymers including plastics. Some examples of functional chemical precursors are alcohols (ethanol, propanol, and butanol), sugar alcohols (xylitol, and sorbitol), furans (furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural), biobased hydrocarbons (isoprene and long-chain hydrocarbons), organic acids (lactic acid, succinic acid, and levulinic acid), and biobased polyurethanes. Current research is focused on optimizing the bioconversion of polysaccharides (yield, rate, separation, titer, and product specificity) by identifying and engineering improved fermentation organisms and fermentation processes and developing enhanced chemical catalysts.Plant-derived cell wall polysaccharides (Chapter 24) including cellulose, xyloglucan, mannan, and xylan (Figure 24.1) are used to produce diverse polymeric materials used by industry. They are both biorenewable and biocompatible, making them advantageous over their petroleum-based counterparts. Cellulose has been extensively modified to develop synthetic cellulose-based polymers. Cellulose films (cellophane) and fibers (rayon) are produced using regenerated cellulose that is itself formed by dissolving natural cellulose (predominantly from wood pulp) in alkali and carbon disulfide and then precipitating the polymer in a process that has been used for at least 125 years (the viscose process).With society\\'s ongoing need for polymers with new properties and functions, there is increased effort to develop chemical or biocatalytic reaction pathways to modify the structure of a polysaccharide backbone or side chains to enable the production of polysaccharide derivatives with enhanced or new properties. Cellulose is one example of a plant polysaccharide that has been extensively modified to develop new biosourced polymers. Reaction pathways have been developed to generate specific cellulose derivatives by substituting accessible hydroxyl groups with other chemical groups. Such derivatives include cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrates, carboxymethyl cellulose, and cellulose butyrate succinate. These products are used in many industrial applications as coatings, inks, binders, and thickening/gelling agents. They are also used in the pharmaceutical industries to produce controlled-release drug tablets and in the cosmetics and food industries as thickening and gelling agents.Chitin is the second most abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose. It is present in crustacean shells and insect cuticles and may also be produced by fungi and algae (Chapter 23). Chitin is composed of 1-4-linked β-D-GlcNAc residues. It can be enzymatically or chemically deacetylated to produce chitosan, the cationic and more water-soluble form of the glycan. Large amounts (∼5 million metric tons) of chitin are produced as waste by the seafood processing industry, and thus, there is considerable interest in developing biobased processes to convert this waste into value-added products. Chitosan has reactive amino and hydroxyl groups that can be modified to generate materials with diverse properties and applications.Hemicellulosic polysaccharides, including xylan and mannan, have a backbone structure similar to cellulose and are abundant in agricultural and forestry sidestreams, including the pulping and the viscose processes. With the complexity and variability of polysaccharide structures there is considerable potential for the development of unique synthetic polysaccharides with new or enhanced functionality. Noncellulosic matrix polysaccharides present an attractive target for enzymatic synthesis and functionalization. They are easily extracted from biomass and, unlike cellulose, are typically soluble in aqueous solutions and are often substituted with both glycosyl and nonglycosyl substituents that can be modified to influence their material properties. To this end, current research aims to further understand and use new reaction pathways that target chemical or enzymatic modifications to functionalize and/or alter specific locations on the polysaccharide and thereby generate regioselective functionalization.Synthetic or naturally derived oligosaccharides can also be covalently appended to polymer chains built from petroleum-based monomers. This gives rise to glycopolymers with architectures resembling those of glycoproteins or proteoglycans. Such materials have found increasing use as research tools to study the biological functions of glycans and are currently explored as biomaterials for drug delivery or as antifouling and antifreeze agents.Nanomaterials from plants and crustacean shells offer new materials for the development of biorenewable and biocompatible products. These nano-sized particles, consisting of bundled polymer chains, have properties and function that are different from the isolated polymer chains from which they are made. Such nanomaterials can be produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, chitin and chitosan. A more focused description is given below on nanomaterials from cellulose.Polysaccharides that have little or no branching of their backbone can self-assemble to form ordered structures in which the individual polymer chains stack along the chain axis, thus forming a crystalline structure. Cellulose is one example of a plant polysaccharide that has this type of crystalline structure. During cellulose biosynthesis individual glucan chains assemble to form microfibril structures that contain both crystalline and disordered arrangements (see Figure 59.1A). The high mechanical stiffness and tensile strength along the length of the cellulose microfibrils provide high mechanical strength, high strength-to-weight ratio, and toughness to plant tissues and organs.(A) The stacking of cellulose chains showing that there are regions of “order” and “disorder.” (B) During one type of cellulose nanomaterial extraction process that uses acid hydrolysis, the disordered regions are preferentially (more...)The cellulose fibril structures and the crystalline regions can be isolated using specialized chemical–mechanical extraction methods. The resulting nano-sized particles, typically referred to as cellulose nanomaterials (CNs), have properties and functions that are considerably different than individual cellulose chains (CNs; Chapter 58). The CNs’ morphology, properties, and surface chemistry vary depending on the plant source and the conditions used to extract the cellulose. Plant CNs are typically classified as cellulose nanocrystals or cellulose nanofibrils. Cellulose nanocrystals are rod-like particles, which are between 3- and 20-nm-wide and between 50 and 500 nm in length (Figure 59.2A). Cellulose nanofibrils are fibril-like particles, which are between 5- and 100-nm-wide and between 500 nm to several microns in length (Figure 59.2B). Both types of CNs have high stiffness and tensile strength, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and surfaces that can be readily chemically modified to alter their physicochemical and materials properties. CNs are biorenewable and biocompatible and have minimal environmental, health, and safety risks. Thus, CNs are being used to develop new products including barrier films, separation membranes, antimicrobial films, food coatings, cement/concrete modifiers, rheology modifiers, biomedical applications, template scaffolds for catalytic supports, batteries, supercapacitors, and many others. Research, development, and commercialization in CNs is accelerating and covering an ever-broadening scope, all of which would benefit through advancements in glycoscience and the new characterization and synthesis tools being developed.Transmission electron microscopy images showing two types of cellulose nanomaterials. (A) Cellulose nanocrystals produced by acid hydrolysis. (B) Cellulose nanofibrils produced by mechanical defibrillation of wood pulp. Considerable resources are being allocated to research and development to create economically viable and sustainable biofuels and bioproducts industries that use plant glycans as feedstocks. In the future, there is likely to be a greater emphasis on using both the glycan and the lignin components of plant biomass to produce liquid transportation fuels and value-added chemicals. Such technologies will require the development of new chemical catalysts and robust enzymes in addition to plants engineered to produce biomass with enhanced processing and value characteristics. Many technical, economic, environmental, and societal challenges must be met if these industries are to develop and contribute to a biobased economy and to reduce the demand for fossil fuels. Despite the commercial and technological success of natural cellulose-based materials, glycans are yet to be systematically explored as building blocks for new materials. The development of controlled polymerization methods for making well-defined glycans, matching those used for producing polymers from petroleum-based building blocks, will need to be developed to fully realize the potential of glycans to produce materials with new properties and functions.The authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Martina Delbianco and Markus Pauly.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022. doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.60Gerald W. Hart and Ajit Varki.This closing chapter discusses the future potential of glycosciences for impacting basic and applied research, human health, material science, and renewable energy. Technological advances predicted to occur in the coming years are mentioned. Finally, a sampling of glycoscience-related questions that remain to be addressed in the future is presented.Every living cell in nature generates a complex and diverse array of glycans that is critical for the evolution, development, functioning, and survival of all natural biological systems (Chapter 1). A strong basic knowledge base regarding the genomics, chemistry, biochemistry, biosynthesis, and biological roles of these ubiquitous and diverse molecules is now well-established (Chapters 2–19). The broad outlines of their natural occurrence and evolution (Chapters 20–27) and their recognition by glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 28–38) are becoming clear, as is their important role in normal and abnormal physiology and disease (Chapters 39–47). Facile methods for their analysis, manipulation, and synthesis of glycans have also been established (Chapters 48–56), and their significance in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, nanotechnology, and bioenergy and materials science is obvious (Chapters 57–59). Given all these major advances in basic and applied research on glycans, there is no reason why this major class of biomolecules should continue to be the “dark matter of the biological universe.” However, since the 1980s an entire generation of scientists have been largely trained without much exposure to, or knowledge of, glycans. Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas.As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19).The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease.Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies. For the great potential of glycobiology to be realized, much greater efforts need to be directed toward education of all undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, clinicians, and basic scientists and toward advancing technologies that will allow ease of experimentation on glycans.Clearly, in the future, we will run out of fossil fuels, which are not renewable resources. Plants are by far the most efficient source of renewable energy because they efficiently use photosynthesis to trap the sun\\'s energy, mostly in the form of glycans. The challenge in using plants as a source of fuel is the difficulty in degrading plant cell walls into smaller glycans that can be converted into usable fuels at a low cost (Chapter 59). In the future, glycoscience will play a critical role in the evolution of our society from one based on burning fossil fuels to one based on the use of sustainable energy, in part derived from rapidly growing plants and algae.Carbon sequestration by photosynthesis to produce glycans is the major process preventing carbon dioxide from building up to levels that are already causing severe “greenhouse” warming of the planet, with unpredictable climate disruption and increased frequency of extreme weather events as major consequences. Wood, which is mostly made up of complex glycans, is already a major building material. Paper, textiles, cellophane, and rayon are other examples of everyday materials made from glycans. As our supply of petroleum runs out, glycans will increasingly be used to provide materials for the manufacture of plastics and a myriad of polymers (Chapter 59). Various forms of modified cellulose, for example, will be critical for the manufacturing of exotic materials and as carbon sources for various chemicals.Advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation and methods in recent years have been remarkable (Chapters 50 and 51). The ability to use mass spectrometry to map glycan attachment sites, to profile glycan structural variations, and to determine detailed fine structures of glycans has progressed rapidly because of technological advances in instrumentation, including electron capture and electron transfer dissociation fragmentation methods, and the development of ion traps with very high mass accuracy and sensitivity. In the future, ion-mobility separations in the gas phase will allow the identification of glycan isomers that have identical molecular masses in mixtures. In addition, there have been major advances in the chromatographic isolation and separation of complex glycans. New ultra-high-pressure pumps and very small particulate high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) resins that can withstand high pressures will also greatly increase the resolving power of chromatography. Advances in ion mobility and high-resolution mass spectrometric methods are, for the first time, allowing us to begin to decode the information content of glycosaminoglycans (Chapter 17). The development of induced hyperpolarization methods shows great promise in greatly increasing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of glycans (Chapter 50), which has been a major limitation in the analyses of biological samples. Recent advances in solution NMR spectroscopy that allows measurements of NOEs between OH groups have increased the number of distance restraints and improve the quality of glycan three-dimensional structures (Chapter 50). Bio-orthogonal labeling methods continue to be developed that will allow the study of changes in glycans in living cells in real time. Currently, for atomic structural analyses of glycoproteins, including X-ray crystallography, it is usually necessary to remove glycans to allow for crystallization. As electron imaging methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), continue to reach higher resolution approaching that achieved by crystallographic analyses, we will be able to obtain images of glycoconjugates at atomic resolution, without the need to remove the glycans. In fact, recent cryo-EM structures of the oligosaccharyltransferases have significantly impacted our molecular understanding of N-linked glycosylation. As NMR becomes more sensitive and can handle larger molecules, one will also be able to visualize glycoconjugates in physiologically relevant solvents and at appropriate temperatures. These developments will allow a much more accurate view of the 3D structures of glycoconjugates. Eventually, one will need to define the population of molecular species (glycoforms of glycoproteins and glycolipids) at an organismal and cellular level to fully understand structure/function relationships of glycoconjugates in response to extracellular stimuli. Existing technologies that show great promise include top-down glycoproteomics and high-throughput, high-resolution imaging methods. In the past few years, there have also been major advances in glycoproteomics. In contrast to glycomics, glycoproteomic approaches do not lose the context of where on a polypeptide glycans are attached (Chapter 51). In theory, if these methods live up to their promise, one day it may be possible to define the complete set of molecular species of glycoconjugates in a population and thus elucidate how they collectively contribute to the many individual functions of a gene product. However, all these methods still result in loss of information about labile modifications of glycans and also involve breaking apart the intact glycome into pieces before analysis. Ultimately, one will need to understand the actual structure of the intact glycome in situ in living systems.In parallel with advances in such sophisticated methods, it is also important to “democratize” the practical approach to glycobiology by developing simple methods that can be used by the average biologist working at the bench without sophisticated instrumentation. The NIH Common Fund has recently supported research designed to make the study of glycosciences more accessible to biologists and biochemists not in the field. In this regard, one should be able to take advantage of the fact that millions of years of pathogen and symbiont interactions with hosts have already generated a large number of highly specific glycan-binding proteins, which could be harnessed to interrogate glycosylation at multiple levels of resolution.The international glycoscience community has recently established a guideline called MIRAGE (minimum information required about a glycomics experiment) to help nonexperts to ensure that publications are understandable and reproducible. These guidelines address sample preparation, mass spectrometry, glycan arrays, and liquid chromatographic methods (Chapters 50–52).Because of their stereochemistry and water solubility, organic synthesis of glycans has proven to be one of the most challenging areas of synthetic organic chemistry (Chapter 53). The combined use of purified glycosyltransferases with chemically synthesized glycan precursors has proven to be invaluable in the stereoselective synthesis of complex glycans (Chapter 54). Automated synthesis of glycans is rapidly becoming a reality, and even the synthesis of the most complex glycans, such as glycosaminoglycans, is becoming possible. In the past five years, major advances have been reported in both the automated chemical and the automated chemico-enzymatic synthesis of complex glycans. In the future, it seems likely that the synthesis of glycans will become nearly as facile and widely available as the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. It should be possible for biologists to easily obtain glycoconjugates that have homogeneously uniform glycans to further explore the structural and functional roles of the glycans. The availability of nearly all of the major glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in recombinant form should also greatly increase our ability to modify glycoconjugates for investigations of structure/function relationships. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the NIH has established a Resource for Integrated Glycotechnology that makes widely available cDNAs and proteins for nearly all of the major mammalian glycoenzymes, including glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and other enzymes involved in glycan synthesis and degradation (Chapters 5 and 6). This resource is greatly facilitating the study of glycans by nonexperts in various areas of biology (http://glycoenzymes.ccrc.uga.edu). In addition, glycoengineering of proteins and lipids will make it possible to generate molecules with novel properties for a wide variety of applications.The complete mapping of multiple genomes continues to have a huge impact on the advancement of glycoscience. The identification, sequencing, and classification of genes important to glycosciences have already allowed us to understand the evolution and functions of genes that affect glycosylation (“glycogenes”) at an unprecedented rate (Chapters 8 and 52). The wealth of information in these databases has only just begun to be mined. These studies will lead to the identification of novel glycosylation enzymes and should shed light on how various species have evolved to produce their glycoforms and glycotypes. Current projects to make cDNAs, mRNA, and proteins for most of the common glycoenzymes available to the wider research community will greatly facilitate the study of glycoconjugates by all investigators.An international Computational and Informatics Resource for Glycosciences (GlyGen) supported by NIH has been established, which is a powerful tool to advance the field. Two annotated and searchable databases for O-GlcNAcylated (OGN) proteins have been established, which currently list nearly 8,000 OGN proteins in human cells. The CAZy database (www.cazy.org) of carbohydrate-active enzymes has also played an important role in advancing the field. The overall goal is to coordinate all of these efforts into bioinformatic databases that a nonexpert can explore in a manner similar to current resources for DNA, RNA, and proteins.The combination of organic synthesis and chemoenzymatic synthesis will allow the production of well-defined glycan arrays that contain the various binding epitopes for glycan-binding proteins. Recombinant glycosyltransferases will become common tools to generate specific glycans on glycoproteins and living cells, and these enzymes will greatly enhance the many studies that now rely on the use of lectins (Chapter 48), whose specificity is often not well-defined. Finally, the rapidly expanding analytical toolkit will be instrumental to decipher the regulatory mechanisms that mediate homeostasis of glycoconjugates at a cellular level. As with analytical methods, it is also important to “democratize” the approaches by developing simple methods for the average biologist working at the bench.In recent years, great advancements in the glycomic profiling of glycans from cells, tissues, or organisms have occurred. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has allowed the rapid profiling of the majority of N- and O-glycans in a sample (Chapter 51). As matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) instruments also gain the ability to perform tandem mass spectrometry, confidence in the structure of profiled glycans will continue to improve. However, detailed structural analysis of individual glycans still remains a low-throughput method that requires considerable expertise and expensive instrumentation. The development of glycan arrays presenting hundreds of different glycans of defined structure is perhaps one of the most impactful recent developments in glycobiology (Chapter 56). These arrays have allowed for rapid, high-throughput analysis of the binding specificities of numerous biologically important glycan-binding proteins, including lectins, antibodies, viruses, and bacteria. It has been estimated that these arrays will need to contain between 10,000 and 20,000 different glycans to cover most possible glycotopes (this highly conservative estimate does not take into account various common and labile modifications of glycans). In addition, more specialized arrays will be required to study glycan-binding proteins made by prokaryotes or to study proteins that bind to glycosaminoglycans, for example. Fortunately, the ability to make such large and diverse glycan arrays is on the horizon, and the remaining challenge will be to better understand the parameters of the glycan arrays, besides the glycans themselves, that influence binding, such as linkers, spacing, and density of glycans on solid supports. Mixtures of glycans need to be studied next, to mimic “clustered saccharide patches” that more closely mimic natural states.Significant progress has also been made in Systems Glycobiology by better integration of glycomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Our understanding as to how miRNAs and transcription factors regulate glycan expression has also improved in the last few years (Chapters 51 and 52).At the present time, the study of glycan structure/function relationships requires highly specialized expertise in synthetic and analytical chemistry. The inherent difficulty in studying glycans remains a major challenge preventing glycobiology—the study of glycan function—from entering mainstream conceptual frameworks of biology. In response to this challenge, strong emphasis has recently been placed on the development of facile technologies that will allow nonglycobiologists without specialized analytical chemistry skills to study glycans in a meaningful way. In fact, the use of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase probes to manipulate glycans is not any more difficult than the use of restriction enzymes and endonucleases to analyze DNA. The use of antibodies and lectins specific for glycans also exemplifies methods that can be readily applied by biologists lacking expensive analytical equipment or extensive glycobiology expertise (Chapter 49). In fact, several kits for the study of glycans have emerged, as companies recognize the future market potential of glycobiology. In addition, companies are offering highly purified enzymes, antibodies, and chemistries, making it much easier to study glycans. In contrast, few glycans are available for experimental purposes and most enzymes that act on glycans are not commercially available. Equally important, most investigators are not trained to know what questions to ask regarding the roles of glycans attached to their favorite glycoconjugate. In addition to new and facile methods to study glycans, education of the next generation of cell biologists and biochemists with respect to the importance of glycans will be key to advancing glycoscience to the next level.It is clear from the chapters in this book that glycans affect all aspects of life on this planet. Yet, there is still a great deal to learn about the functions of glycans in biology. Below is a sampling of some “big” questions in glycobiology that remain to be answered in the future.How Common Is the Occurrence, and What Are the Functions of “glycoRNAs” on the Surfaces of Mammalian Cells?Recently, using chemical and biochemical approaches, it was reported that small noncoding RNAs bear N-glycan-type (Chapter 9) sialylated (Chapter 15) glycans. These so-called “glycoRNAs” were found on the surfaces of multiple cell types and mammalian species, in cultured cells, and in vivo. This remarkable finding, if confirmed by other researchers, may bridge RNA biology and glycobiology and expand the roles of RNA at the cell surface.What Are the Roles of Glycans in the Organization of the Components in the Plasma Membrane, Glycocalyx, and Extracellular Matrix?Glycans affect the stability and turnover of cell-surface resident molecules, and many can self-associate in the plane of the membrane. Do they play a role in the organization and regional concentration of molecules at the cell surface? How do the various glycoconjugates on cell surfaces collaborate among themselves and with glycan-binding proteins to organize the glycocalyx of a given cell or its extracellular matrix? After all, most living cells in a multicellular organism exist within a glycan-enriched gel, not in the artificially fluid medium of the tissue culture dish.How Do Glycans Regulate Cellular Signaling from the Cell Surface to the Nucleus?Complex glycans clearly regulate the function, stability, and residence time of receptors at the cell surface, and the addition of O-GlcNAc to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins regulates many of the signaling pathways downstream from these receptors. Yet, still very little is known about the mechanistic roles of glycans in these pathways.Is There a Biological Significance for Site-Specific Glycan Diversity on Glycoproteins?Glycoproteins typically contain an array of many glycans with different structures at individual sites in the polypeptide. Evidence suggests that these arrays of glycans are site-specific and cell type–specific, and not random in distribution. How does site-specific diversity arise and how is it controlled? Does each glycoform have different biological functions or variable strengths and/or does the site-specific diversity control molecular interactions? Or is the complexity the natural outcome of evolutionary arms races between hosts and their pathogens, which exploit glycans in various ways?Can Specific Glycoforms of Glycoproteins Be Used to Improve Biomarkers for Disease?Many investigators are trying to discover biomarkers to help diagnose disease, such as cancer. It has been proposed that identification of specific glycoforms of a glycoprotein might improve the specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers.How Can the Marked Mobility of Glycans in Biological Systems Be Taken into Account?Unlike most other biomolecules, glycans have a substantial degree of mobility in aqueous solution. This further increases the potential information content of these molecules but also raises further challenges for their analysis and biological exploration.How Do Cell-Surface Glycans and Matrix Glycans Contribute to Cancer Progression and Metastasis?Data from glycan analysis, animal models, and correlations from the clinic strongly indicate that cell-surface glycans are critical to tumor progression and metastasis. Yet mechanistically, relatively little is known with respect to the roles glycans play in these processes.The Glycosciences Should Have a Huge Impact on Antiviral, Antibacterial, and Antifungal Diagnostics and Therapeutics—How Does One Make This Happen?It is known that glycans are critical to infectious disease and are key antigens in the generation of several vaccines. As conventional antibiotics become less effective, how does one exploit glycans to fight infectious disease?Can Glycan Analytical Methods Be Improved to Avoid Loss of Labile Modifications?Most current analytical methods for glycans result in a marked loss of labile modifications, particularly ester groups of various kinds. Given their location and potential biological importance, there is likely a large unexplored area of glycobiology that can only be approached with new techniques.What Is the True Extent of Diversity of the Nonulosonic Acids and What Are the Functions of This Diversity?The discovery that the highly diverse sialic acids are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg of the ancestral family of nonulosonic acids has raised many new questions. It appears that investigators are just beginning to scratch the surface of this enormous diversity and its potential biological significance.How Can One Decode the Information Content in Glycosaminoglycans and Proteoglycans at the Molecular Level?The potential information content of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans is enormous. Yet, investigators are only just beginning to be able to understand how the arrangement of sulfate esters and uronic acids affects affinity and protein-binding selectivity. Elucidating how such diversity is regulated temporally and spatially is also a major challenge going forward.What Are the Molecular Mechanisms by Which O-GlcNAcylation Regulates Transcription and Signaling in Response to Nutrients?Current data indicate that O-GlcNAc serves as a nutrient sensor to regulate signaling and transcription. Yet, mechanistically, almost nothing is known with respect to how the cycling of this sugar on and off proteins regulates these processes at the molecular level. More than 40% of proteins in the brain are O-GlcNAcylated. What are the roles of O-GlcNAc cycling at the synapse, in brain development, and in learning and memory?Has Nature Only Made Use of a Small Subset of All the Possible Monosaccharides?There are hundreds of known monosaccharides, and many can be present in different ring and/or modified forms. So far, it appears that natural systems have only incorporated a fraction of this diversity. Is this because of rate limits on genomic and enzymatic evolution in the opportunity to incorporate new monosaccharides or is this an ascertainment bias, owing to the fact that only a small fraction of species on the planet has been sampled. Is it possible that every possible monosaccharide has been used somewhere in nature?What Are the Complete Structures of All the Glycans within the Human Glycome or Any Animal or Plant Glycome?Every day witnesses new glycan structures being identified, with previously unknown and novel sugar linkages, along with unique and unanticipated modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphodiesters, and sulfation. How many such glycan structures exist within a glycome, to what glycoproteins or lipids are they attached, and where are they attached? Much of our knowledge of the human glycome comes from studying serum glycoproteins and several cell lines, but there is little information about the overall complexity of the human glycome either at the glycan level or the glycoprotein level.What Is the True Extent of Diversity of Glycans, Glycan-Binding Proteins, and Glycan-Degrading Enzymes in the Microbiome?It is clear that investigators are just beginning to scratch the surface of the organismal diversity within the complex diverse microbiomes that occupy various niches in nature. Each time a new species within a given microbiome is sequenced, the genomes are found to predict hundreds of “carbohydrate-active” enzymes. Understanding the mechanisms and functions of all these molecules is a major challenge for the future, as is the deciphering of the structures of the complex glycans they generate, bind, or degrade.Do More Complex Biological Systems Have Simpler Glycosylation?Of the hundreds of known monosaccharides in nature, less than a dozen are found in vertebrates, and many more tend to be found in simpler, earlier evolved systems. Is this an ascertainment bias or does increasing biological complexity place limits on the fraction of the genome that can be committed to controlling glycosylation?What Is the Significance of Lineage-Specific Gains and Losses of Specific Glycans during Evolution?Current data indicate that glycans are the most rapidly diverging components of life-forms, with distinct gains and losses that sometimes become (or stay) polymorphic in various lineages and clades. It seems likely that this is a consequence of the intimate involvement of glycans in the most rapidly evolving aspects of biological systems (i.e., host–pathogen interactions, immunity, and reproduction). Further studies are needed to ascertain if glycans are indeed involved in the process of speciation.When Will the Integration of Glyosciences into the Mainstream of Bioinformatics Be Achieved?Currently, searches of the main genome and protein databases used by essentially all biologists yield almost no information on the glycosylation state of glycoproteins. Indeed, there is as yet no central comprehensive database of glycan structures that an investigator can mine to determine the occurrence, provenance, or phylogeny of a specific glycan of interest. An international effort led by nearly every major country involved in the glycosciences has come together to agree on uniform standards for describing glycans in computer databases and to develop methods to curate and maintain glycan structural data. Together with the expanding use of uniform symbol nomenclature (Chapter 1), this is the first step toward integrating glycomic data into mainstream protein databases (Chapter 52).When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans. But a combination of advances in methodology and education will eventually integrate glycosciences into the general awareness of biologists who are currently not trained to understand the significance of glycans. As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA. In the long run, glycobiology will merge into a holistic approach to biological systems. When that intellectual singularity is eventually achieved, further editions of this book may no longer be necessary.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

With the exception of Entamoeba histolytica proteophosphoglycan (PPG) (panel I), all known protein-linked GPI anchors have the same minimal core structure embellished with species- and tissue-specific side-chain and lipid variations. In mammalian cells, ethanolamine-PO4 on α1-6-linked Man (Man-2) rather than α1-2-linked Man (Man-3) is preferentially used to attach GPI to some GPI-anchored proteins. Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan (panel II) is unusual in that it lacks the linking ethanolamine residue; instead its GPI portion is linked to the galactomannan chain via a fourth mannose residue. Those fungal GPI-APs that are present on the cell wall are normally linked to the underlying beta-glucan layer after loss of the glucosaminylphospholipid moiety. Soluble GPI structures are released from the cell surface by the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) or GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). (±) Glycosyl heterogeneity; curved arrows for the Saccharomyces examples in panel II, the two terminal αMan residues are mutually exclusive; (*) unknown lipid type or chain length.

It is a unique Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase with 3 TM domains.Side chain Man-5 modificationA Man α1,3 (5%) or a Man α1,2 (15%) is added to Man-4 in roughly 20% of yeast GPI-APs. The former is added in cis-Golgi and the latter in trans-Golgi.Note: The mannosyltransferases involved have not yet been identified.Side chain Man-4 modificationA Man α1,2 is also added to Man-3 of some proteins in several Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species by Gpi10/PIG-B (which is also responsible for addition of Man-3).Side chain β3GlcNAc modificationTbGT8: 377 AA, 1 TM, β1-3GlcNAc transferaseNote: Involved in branched poly-LacNAc synthesis.Side chain β6GlcNAc modificationTbGT10: 384 AA, 1 TM, UDP-GlcNAc: βGal β1-6 GlcNAc-transferaseNote: Elaborates the side chain in procyclin form by adding a β1-6GlcNAc branch at βGal.Side chain Gal modificationB3GALT4, 378 AA, 1 TM, GPI-Gal transferaseNote: B3GALT4 is a GM1 synthase, but is also involved in addition of β1-3Gal to the GalNAc on GPI side-chain. Presence of lactosylceramide on membrane enhances the GPI-galactosylation mediated by B3GALT4.Side chain Gal modificationTbGT3: 377 AA, 1 TM, UDP-Gal: β-GlcNAc-GPI β1-3Gal transferaseNote: Adds a Gal residue to the nonreducing-terminal GlcNAc residue.Side chain Sia modificationThe galactose is further modified by a sialic acid with α2-3 linkage.Note: The sialyltransferase has not been identified yet.Side chain Sia modificationTrypanosomes do not biosynthesize sialic acid. They use trans-sialidases to transfer host sialic acids to their own GPI anchors.Note: TbTS and TbSA C2 are two such trans-sialidases identified.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) releases the lipid portion of the GPI anchor and generates a myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate group that is part of the cross-reacting determinant (CRD) epitope. This reaction is blocked if the myo-inositol ring is acylated at C-2. Nitrous acid deamination of the GlcN residue releases the phosphatidylinositol (PI) component for mass spectrometric analysis. Nitrous acid deamination also converts the GlcN residue to 2,5-anhydromannitol (AHM) that can be radiolabeled by sodium borotritide reduction or fluorescently labeled by reductive amination with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB). Following dephosphorylation with cold aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF), the labeled glycans can be conveniently sequenced with exoglycosidases. Cold aqueous HF dephosphorylation followed by permethylation produces a positively charged permethylated GPI glycan amenable to tandem mass spectrometry. ES-MS-MS, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; TLC, thin-layer chromatography.The presence of GPI-APs in cell lysates may be inferred indirectly by the following methods.1) Treatment with PI-PLC: GPI-APs that are acylated at C-2 of inositol are not sensitive to PI-PLC and cannot be identified by this method. Other GPI-APs, when treated with PI-PLC, lose the lipid portion of the GPI anchor (as shown in the scheme above). This results ina) GPI-APs becoming soluble in aqueous buffers and shifting from the pellet to the supernatant fraction.b) GPI-APs partitioning into the aqueous phase from the detergent-rich phase when the enzyme treatment is followed by Triton X-114 (a nonionic detergent) phase separation.c) the appearance of an epitope known as the “cross-reacting determinant,” which can be detected by specific antibodies.2) Treatment with GPI-PLD: All GPI-APs are sensitive to serum GPI-phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) treatment, which releases the phospholipid portion of the GPI anchors. Treatment with GPI-PLDa) generally requires detergent solubilization of the substrate and does not generate a “cross-reacting determinant”.b) could leave one fatty acid attached to the protein, depending on the inositol-acylation status of the GPI-AP, and prevent complete Triton X-114 phase separation.3) Metabolic labeling with [3H]myo-inositol: Since PI modification is only present as part of the GPI anchor in proteins, metabolic labeling of cells with [3H]myo-inositol will result in the radiolabel being incorporated only into GPI-APs, which can then be detected with high sensitivity.4) Detection with fluorescently labeled aerolysin (FLAER): Certain pore-forming bacterial toxins such as aerolysin have been shown to bind to GPI anchors, and these may be used to detect GPI-APs directly on cell surfaces or to probe one- and two-dimensional gel western blots.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

Glycobiology16: 1R–27R.There are other animal proteins that recognize glycans in a lectin-like manner and do not appear to fall into one of the well-recognized classes (e.g., various cytokines).Hyaluronan (HA)-binding proteins (hyaloadherins) fall in between these two classes. On the one hand, some (but not all) of the hyaloadherins have shared evolutionary origins. On the other hand, recognition involves internal regions of HA, which is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan.The content of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported license.

This is used throughout this book. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) system was developed as a collaboration among the editors of this book and an extended community advisory group. The nomenclature now undergoes periodic updates at a separate NCBI SNFG page.The Organizations and Publications Adopting SNFG can be found here. It lists current initiatives, databases, journals, societies, or publishers that have thus far accepted or recommend the use of this SNFG nomenclature and includes suggested text for journal \"Instructions to Authors.\"Additional adoptions can be reported to editor Nicolle Packer (ua.ude.qm@rekcap.ikcin), for consideration of inclusion in future updates to the online listing.
