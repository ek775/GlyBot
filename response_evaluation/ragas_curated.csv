 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites.

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.']","This underscores their conformational flexibility, which is likely advantageous for the orientation of sulfate groups in heparin saccharides (HS) to maximize binding affinity to proteins.","Structural elements that dictate preferences for one form over the other, including the possible effects from the sulfated monosaccharide sequences around the IdoA/IdoA2S residue, are subject to further investigation. A second factor contributing to structural diversity and selective interactions with certain HS-binding proteins is the size of the sulfated saccharide domains. HS isolated from natural sources shows domain-like structures, with clusters of six to eight saccharides forming the highly sulfated domains known as S-domains. These regions are separated by nonsulfated saccharide residues, consisting of GlcA-GlcNAc RUs, known as NAc-domains. The S-domains contain primarily IdoA residues that likely contribute the flexibility needed to optimize binding to proteins and elicit desired biological activities.",0.0,0.6517441105298749,0.4660981342561127,0.6613298917005304,0.012658227848101266,0.699999999965,,0.0,0.8333333332916666,1.0,0.0,1.0

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","Here's a potential completion of the paragraph:

In bacteria, Archaea, and fungi, glycans serve critical structural roles in the cell wall and in resisting large differences in osmolarity between cytoplasm and environment. In eukaryotes, both secretory proteins and membrane proteins typically pass through an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi pathway, the cellular system in which many major glycosylation reactions occur (see below). Most proteins in the blood plasma of animals (with the exception of albumin) are also heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation of these and other secreted proteins may provide solubility, hydrophilicity, and negative charge, thus reducing unwanted intermolecular interactions and protecting against proteolysis. Cell-surface membrane proteins like receptors, adhesion molecules, and channels are typically glycosylated, and this modification can promote their proper folding, ensure their stability, and impact function.",1.0,0.6978974264084422,0.47062419901780855,0.823850260661297,0.0,0.9999999999666667,0.8,0.0,0.99999999998,1.0,1.0,1.0

For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D. Esko, Victor Nizet, and the late Nathan Sharon and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek and Ajit Varki.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Ramya and Gabriel Rabinovich.']",with over 100 distinct members identified to date.,"In many cases, they catalyze a group-transfer reaction in which the monosaccharide moiety of a simple nucleotide sugar donor (electrophile) substrate (e.g., UDP-Gal, GDP-Fuc, or CMP-Sia; Chapter 5) is transferred to the acceptor (nucleophile) substrate. In some instances, the donor substrates contain a lipid moiety, such as dolichol-phosphate, linked to mannose or glucose. For other glycosyltransferases, the donor substrate is dolichol-pyrophosphate, linked to an oligosaccharide, and in these cases the entire oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc to the acceptor substrate (Chapter 9). Similarly, other lipid-linked sugars serve as donor substrates for bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of peptidoglycan (e.g., GlcNAc-MurNAc(pentapeptide)-undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), lipopolysaccharide, and capsules (Chapters 21 and 22). Glycosyltransferases that use monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA as acceptor substrates have been characterized (activity to RNA has also been suggested), but only glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids are discussed in this chapter.",0.0,0.5589562552527044,0.27699067364886665,0.6793912660240381,0.015625,0.0,,0.0,0.8333333332916666,1.0,1.0,1.0
6,"Complete the following paragraph: Over the years, many theories have been advanced regarding biological roles of glycans. Although there is evidence to support all the theories, exceptions to each one can also be found. This should not be surprising, given the abundance and enormous diversity of glycans in nature. Complexities also arise because glycans are frequently bound by microbes and microbial toxins, making them a liability to the organism that synthesizes them. Biological functions of glycans can be divided into three broad categories:","['Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis. The groups of Stuart Kornfeld and Kurt von Figura then found, surprisingly, that some of the M6P moieties were “blocked” by α-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to the phosphate residue, creating a phosphodiester. Comparison of glycans with phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters predicted that the metabolic precursor of the M6P determinant was a phosphodiester and that phosphorylation was mediated not by an ATP-dependent kinase but by a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This was proven using a double-labeled donor and Golgi extracts: Another Golgi enzyme phosphodiester glycosidase was shown to remove the outer N-acetylglucosamine residue and “uncover” the M6P moiety. Pulse-chase studies confirmed the order of events, documenting that multiple glycans on a given lysosomal enzyme could acquire one or two phosphate residues and that removal of some mannose residues on the N-glycan by processing Golgi mannosidases was also required (Figure 33.2). In most cell types, the phosphate is eventually lost after exposure to acid phosphatases 5 and 2 (ACP5, ACP2) in lysosomes. The overall biochemical pathway is shown in Figure 33.2. Pathways for biosynthesis of N-glycans bearing the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. Following early N-glycan processing (Chapter 9), a single GlcNAc phosphodiester is added to the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes on one of three mannose (Man) (more...) The first two enzymes that mediate these reactions were then purified and characterized and the encoding genes cloned. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-P-T) is an α2β2γ2 complex encoded by two genes. The α- and β-subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene, whose 1256 amino acid type-III transmembrane product undergoes proteolysis in the Golgi by site-1-protease (S1P) to give rise to the two subunits, whereas the 305 amino acid γ-subunit is encoded by the GNPTG gene (Figure 33.3). The α/β subunits contain the catalytic function of the enzyme (Stealth domains) as well as elements (Notch1, Notch2, and DMAP [DNA-methylase-associated protein]) that mediate binding to protein determinants present on the lysosomal enzymes. The γ-subunit facilitates the phosphorylation of a subset of the lysosomal enzymes. It contains an M6P receptor homology (MRH) domain that is thought to bind oligomannosyl N-glycans on the lysosomal enzymes and present them to the catalytic site for phosphorylation, and a DMAP recognition domain. The second enzyme, α-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester glycosidase encoded by the NAGPA gene, is a complex of four identical 68-kDa subunits, arranged as two disulfide-linked homodimers. Unlike other Golgi enzymes, this is a type-I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with its amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi. GlcNAc-P-T is an α2β2γ2 hexamer encoded by two genes. The GNPTAB gene encodes a catalytically inactive type 3 transmembrane precursor that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage between Lys-928 and Asp-929 in the Golgi by site-1-protease (more...) The oligomannosyl N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes are identical to those of many other glycoproteins passing through the ER–Golgi pathway. Thus, specific recognition by GlcNAc-P-T is crucial to achieve selective trafficking. This recognition is not explained by any similarities in the primary polypeptide sequences of lysosomal enzymes.'
 'It has therefore been of interest to engineer more homogeneous α2-6-sialylation in cells. These efforts have mainly been limited to the overexpression of α2-6-sialyltransferases to override endogenous α2-3-sialylation with variable results, illustrating the complexity of engineering glycosylation in cells with competing pathways. An innovative glycoengineering strategy (GlycoDelete) reduced the inherent heterogeneity of mammalian N-glycan structures. Human HEK293-T cells lacking MGAT1 were stably transfected to express a fungal endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoT) that efficiently truncated N-glycans to a single GlcNAc, which was an acceptor for galactosylation and sialylation. Recombinant antibodies with truncated N-glycans had lower affinity for Fcγ receptors, suggesting that this glycoengineering strategy may be suitable for use with neutralizing antibodies. Deconstruction of the N-glycosylation pathway in CHO cells was performed by precise gene editing to knock out 19 glycosyltransferases, including all four α2-3-sialyltransferases that function on N-glycans (Figure 56.3). Combining knockout of St3gal4 and St3gal6 with site-specific knock-in of St6gal1 resulted in homogeneous α2-6-sialylation. Combinatorial knockout of all isoenzymes involved in N-glycan sialylation, galactosylation/LacNAc formation, branching, and core fucosylation has provided a design matrix for improving the homogeneity of N-glycans in CHO cells. A combination of five gene knockouts and the knock-in of St6gal1 created the glycoprotein therapeutic erythropoietin having homogeneous biantennary N-glycans with terminal α2-6-Neu5Ac. Wider engineering of almost all genes involved in N-glycosylation in CHO cells has shown that there are few limitations for engineering of glycosylation. For example, the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (Gnptab) that tags select oligomannose N-glycans on glycoproteins destined for lysosomal targeting was knocked out to produce lysosomal enzymes bearing complex-type sialylated glycans with extended blood circulation and improved biodistribution. (A) A complex N-glycan with glycosyltransferases responsible for each reaction. Combinatorial knockout of the glycosyltransferase isoenzyme genes indicated led to the identification of the primary genes (highlighted in bold) controlling N-glycan branching (more...) Therapeutic glycoprotein production still suffers from heterogeneity, including variations in which Asn residues are glycosylated (site occupancy, macroheterogeneity) and/or the diversity of mature glycan structures at any one site (microheterogeneity). This is currently addressed by ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through the use of highly standardized bioprocessing protocols, but this strategy is far from optimal. For example, incompletely sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins may be cleared by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell–Morell receptor), resulting in inconsistent circulatory half-lives of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 34). Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sialylation by overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases as well as inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases in host cells. Protein-specific glycosylation patterns and heterogeneity are more difficult to control. Nonhuman mammalian cell lines can produce two immunogenic nonhuman glycans: α1-3-Gal added to N-acetyllactosamine and Neu5Gc added to Gal or GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 15). The α1-3-galactosyltransferase and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydrolase genes responsible are inactive in humans. Although α1-3-Gal and Neu5Gc are not produced in CHO cells, both genes have been knocked out as a precaution. Even so, Neu5Gc scavenged from animal glycoproteins used in cell culture can appear in expressed glycoproteins, so use of defined media lacking nonhuman glycoproteins is also necessary. In engineering mammalian cell lines, it is important to consider that the glycosylation capacity is driven by the expression of a subset of available enzyme genes, but unexpressed genes can become activated. Thus, cell-specific glycosylation features are generally controlled by transcriptional regulation rather than mutations or gene aberrations.'
 'Signaling activity of C-type lectins (CTLs) in innate immune responses. CTLs expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages interact with different glycans, often expressed on pathogen-derived glycans. Activation of CTLs occurs through glycan binding, (more...) Among the myeloid CTLDs, CLEC-2 is expressed by NK cells, DCs, megakaryocytes, and platelets, but it is also expressed on some tumor cells. CLEC-2 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein whose signaling is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of a single tyrosine in the YXXL motif of its cytoplasmic domain. Signaling involves Src and Syk kinases and phospholipase Cγ2. CLEC-2 is also a receptor for the platelet-activating snake toxin rhodocytin, from the Malayan viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma. The major endogenous glycoprotein ligand for CLEC-2 is podoplanin (also called Aggrus), expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). CLEC-2 binds to the sialylated O-glycans and peptide portions of podoplanin. This is physiologically important and serves both as an alternative pathway for in vivo platelet activation, as well as fundamentally serving to drive lymphangiogenesis through the signaling functions of podoplanin. In the absence of extended O-glycans on podoplanin, as engineered in mice lacking C1GalT1 (T-synthase), due to loss of T-synthase or its chaperone Cosmc (C1GalT1C1), podoplanin is dysfunctional. This leads to defects in lymphangiogenesis, for lack of platelet involvement, a phenotype that closely phenocopies that seen in podoplanin-deficient mice. The CLEC-2-podoplanin pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cell motility and lymph node architecture and regulates inflammation notably during sepsis. Interestingly, different regions of the CTLD in CLEC-2 can bind the O-glycosylated podoplanin and the nonglycosylated rhodocytin. Another potential adhesion molecule is prolectin (CLEC17A), which is expressed in dividing B cells in germinal centers, and interacts with glycans containing terminal α-linked mannose or fucose residues. It may function within lymph nodes as an adhesion or colonization factor for invading tumor cells and shows preference for binding to epithelial rather than mesenchymal cells, which is relevant for tumor cells undergoing epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Both macrophages and DCs are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that internalize antigens via specific endocytic receptors or by fluid-phase pinocytosis; they process antigens for presentation to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. DCs also contribute to the balance between tolerance and the induction of immunity and help to distinguish harmless “self-antigens” from pathogens. TLRs and CTLs (for myeloid cells, these have also been termed CTL receptors or CLRs) act to help DCs discriminate between pathogens and self-antigens. TLRs are PRRs that interact with PAMPs, but, unlike CLRs, TLRs cannot directly promote phagocytosis of bound ligands. A CLR can signal by itself, but can also interfere in signaling pathways induced by various other myeloid PRRs, such as TLRs, and hence can provide diverse immunological response outcomes. For example, mycobacteria interact with DCs via TLR-2 and TLR-4, resulting in strong T-helper 1 (Th1) responses by the activated DCs. However, some virulent strains of mycobacteria secrete glycosylated factors (e.g., mannosylated lipoarabinomannan or ManLAM) that are bound by CLRs, but apparently not by TLRs, which lead to down-regulation of TLR activation and limitation of DC maturation. DC-SIGN can tailor immune responses toward specific self and foreign structures in interaction with the signaling of other PRRs. The recognition of mannose-carrying PAMPs expressed by M. tuberculosis and HIV-1 activates the kinase Raf-1 to modulate TLR-induced NF-κB activation and enhance the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-12.'
 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates. Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native fully glycosylated HIV-1 envelope trimer. Protein subunits are shown as gray surfaces and glycans are shown as ball and sticks (PDB entry 5FUU). Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'Figure 17.2 depicts schematic short segments of glycosaminoglycans and their characteristic features. Hyaluronan does not occur covalently linked to a protein core but instead interacts noncovalently with some proteoglycans via hyaluronan-binding motifs (Chapter 16). Generally, invertebrates produce the same types of glycosaminoglycans as vertebrates, except that hyaluronan is not present and the chondroitin chains are predominantly, although not exclusively, nonsulfated. Most proteoglycans also contain N- and O-glycans typically found on glycoproteins (see Chapters 9 and 10). The glycosaminoglycan chains are much larger than these other types of glycans (e.g., a 20-kDa glycosaminoglycan chain contains approximately 80 sugar residues, whereas a typical biantennary N-glycan contains 10 to 12 residues). Keratan sulfate is a sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain present on a limited number of proteins as an N-linked or O-linked chain. The composition of the glycosaminoglycan chains, the structure of the protein cores, and the distribution of the proteoglycan all determine the biological activities associated with proteoglycans. Proteoglycans consist of a protein core (brown) and one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chains (dark blue, HS, heparan sulfate; yellow, CS/DS, chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate; light blue, KS, keratan sulfate). Membrane proteoglycans (more...) Glycosaminoglycans consist of alternating N-acetylated (GlcNAc or GalNAc) or N-sulfated (GlcNS) glucosamine and either a uronic acid (GlcA or IdoA) or galactose (Gal). Hyaluronan lacks sulfate groups, but the rest of the glycosaminoglycans contain sulfates (more...) Virtually all mammalian cells produce proteoglycans and secrete them into the ECM, insert them into the plasma membrane, or store them in secretory granules. The ECM, an essential component of all multicellular animals, determines the physical characteristics of tissues and many of the biological properties of the cells embedded in it. The major components of the ECM are fibrillar proteins that provide tensile strength and elasticity (e.g., various collagens and elastins), adhesive glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, laminins, and tenascins), and proteoglycans that interact with other ECM components to promote ECM assembly, govern its physical properties, and serve as a reservoir of biologically active small proteins such as growth factors. A single cell type can express multiple proteoglycans. Vascular endothelial cells, for example, synthesize several different cell-surface proteoglycans, secretory granule proteoglycans, as well as several ECM proteoglycans. Compared with the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of glycoproteins that carry N- and O-linked glycans, to date, relatively few proteins have been identified that carry glycosaminoglycans (less than 50), but the application of new glycoproteomic approaches has already led to the discovery of several new proteoglycans. Tremendous structural variation of proteoglycans exists due to a number of factors. First, many proteoglycans can be substituted with one or more types of glycosaminoglycan chain; for example, glypicans contain heparan sulfate, whereas syndecan-1 contains both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. Some proteoglycans contain only one glycosaminoglycan chain (e.g., decorin), whereas others have more than 100 chains (e.g., aggrecan). Another source of variability lies in the stoichiometry of glycosaminoglycan chain substitution. For example, syndecan-1 has five attachment sites for glycosaminoglycans, but not all of the sites are used equally. Other proteoglycans can be “part-time”—that is, they may exist with or without a glycosaminoglycan chain or with only a truncated oligosaccharide. A given proteoglycan present in different cell types often shows differences in the number of glycosaminoglycan chains, their lengths, and the arrangement of sulfated residues along the chains.']","first, they can play structural roles, providing shape and stability to molecules or influencing protein-ligand interactions; second, glycans can act as recognition markers for cells and proteins, facilitating specific binding events; and third, they can participate in signal transduction pathways, modulating cellular responses to environmental cues.","(1) structural contributions (e.g., extracellular scaffolds: cell walls and extracellular matrices, protein folding and function); (2) energy metabolism (e.g., carbohydrates as carbon sources for storage and manipulation of animal behavior: pollination and seed dispersal); and (3) information carriers (e.g., molecular patterns recognized by glycan binding proteins [GBPs])",,,0.4812799768353496,0.4260747360716382,0.03278688524590164,0.4777777777618519,,0.0,0.99999999998,,,
7,"Complete the following paragraph: The glycome comprises all the glycan structures synthesized by an organism. It is analogous to the genome, the transcriptome, and/or the proteome but even more dynamic, and it has higher structural complexity that has yet to be fully defined. Cells of different types synthesize a subset of the glycome based on their differentiation state and physiological environment.","['Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored. The authors appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Cristina De Castro and Christopher Mark West.'
 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

The result is a unique set of glycomarkers that are essential for each cell type or organism's survival, growth, and interactions with its environment.","The human and mouse glycomes have many glycan structures in common, but a few are unique or have divergent functional properties. For example, unlike humans, rodents synthesize cytidine monophospho-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Gc), for the transfer of Neu5Gc to N- and O-glycans (Chapter 15). Similarly, the gene encoding α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (A3GALT2) is functional in the mouse but not in human (Chapter 20). The human and fly genomes include orthologous genes encoding GTs that catalyze the same reaction, but they also have GTs that are unique. Thus, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) in mammals and Ofut1 in flies transfer fucose to Notch receptors and are examples of an evolutionarily conserved GT. In contrast, flies do not make complex N-glycans with four branches, which are common in mammalian glycoproteins (Chapters 9 and 20). Additionally, flies make unique glycolipids absent from mammals that are important for conserved signaling pathways mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Notch receptors (Chapter 26).",0.2,0.5746524610596841,0.5639662112138049,0.7564286676504823,0.0,0.8666666666377778,0.5714285714285714,0.0,0.9166666666361111,1.0,1.0,1.0

Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5).

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'

This chapter illustrates and discusses some key mechanisms by which glycans influence the pathogenesis and progression of bacterial and viral infections and describes examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Infectious diseases remain a major cause of death, disability, and social and economic disorder for millions of people throughout the world. Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host. Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors. A human in good health is colonized by as many as 1013 bacteria on the skin and mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, a number that resembles the number of cells in our own body. Despite all these direct and continuous encounters, it is relatively rare that bacteria invade into the tissues to produce serious infections. Although not restricted to pathogenic species/strains, one feature shared by many of these disease-causing agents is the presence of diverse polysaccharide capsule structures, which encapsulate bacteria (Chapter 21). These structures can have many biological properties, both stimulating and thwarting immune detection in different settings. Capsules make key contributions to the virulence of multiple bacterial pathogens, reducing recognition by the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, capsular polysaccharides are also commonly the natural targets of the adaptive immune system. In fact, antibodies specific to different capsule structures often define the serology used to differentiate subtypes of particular bacterial species. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) encodes perhaps the most historically significant capsule in biology and medicine. Pioneering experiments by Frederick Griffith in 1928 showed the in vivo transfer of virulence from a dead encapsulated (smooth) disease-causing strain to an avirulent, nonencapsulated (rough) strain. Studies regarding immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharides (Figure 42.1) provided the framework for the discoveries of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, which showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information. Classical experiments on the role of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule in virulence. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) strains can be identified with either a “rough” (R) or a “smooth” (S) phenotype, the latter being (more...) Killing of bacteria by phagocytes of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils or macrophages, is aided by opsonization, a process in which the bacterial surface is tagged with complement proteins or specific antibodies. Phagocytes express receptors for activated complement and antibody Fc domains, allowing them to bind, engulf, and kill bacteria. Together these processes are referred to as opsonophagocytosis. Genetic mutagenesis of capsule biosynthesis genes and infectious challenge in small animal models have illustrated the roles of bacterial capsules in resisting opsonophagocytosis. Compared with the wild-type parent bacterial strains, isogenic capsule-deficient mutants of group A Streptococcus (GAS), group B Streptococcus (GBS), pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), and several other important human pathogens are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by opsonophagocytosis and fail to establish systemic infection.'

Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-protein anchors were first postulated in the mid-1970s when highly purified bacterial PI-specific PLCs were observed to release proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase, from mammalian plasma membranes.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5).

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection.

17,"Complete the following paragraph: Highly conserved homologs of OGT and OFT are found in numerous bacterial genomes, although studies of their functional roles are essentially nonexistent.","['In some cases, these latter lectins are encoded by separate but very similar genes. More than 100 of the seed legume L-type lectins have been characterized and are the most extensively studied proteins of this class. It also should be noted that the L-type fold has been observed in noncarbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectin-like receptor kinases in plants that are important in development and stress responses. A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet. The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand. An exception to this case is found in two lectins (ConA and the closely related Dioclea grandiflora lectin) in which the glycine is replaced with an arginine. Both the glycine and arginine form hydrogen bonds with the ligand via their main-chain amides. Loop C contains an invariant asparagine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via its side chain, and an invariant hydrophobic amino acid. Besides these invariant amino acids, backbone atoms of the residues of loop D also contribute to monosaccharide recognition. (Top) Three-dimensional structure of a peanut agglutinin (PNA) monomer showing the four loops involved in sugar binding: loops A, B, C, and D. The bound sugar (lactose) is shown as a “ball-and-stick” model. Calcium and manganese ions are (more...) The legume L-type lectins are generally classified into groups based on their carbohydrate specificities as often identified by the ability of monosaccharides to inhibit their agglutinating activity. These differences in specificities are brought about by variability in the conformation and size of the D loop and to some extent by the C loop. Although the main specificity regions of the legume lectins are determined by the loops, there are sites other than these that contribute to lectin specificity. There are several additional modes of refining these specificities, such as interaction with water, posttranslational modifications, and state of oligomerization. Legume L-type lectins are oligomeric—mostly dimeric or tetrameric in nature—and adopt a variety of quaternary structures. The back β-sheet in the monomeric unit is involved in oligomerization. Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class. Interestingly, some legume lectins have a hydrophobic binding site that binds adenine and adenine-derived plant hormones with micromolar affinity; this is two to three orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for monosaccharides.'

 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""
 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition.

A recent phylogenetic analysis of EF-P sequences revealed a subset of enzymes with an Arg in place of Lys, and a coevolving gene that was subsequently identified by biochemistry and mass spectrometry as an argininyl rhamnosyltransferase.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'

 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

For instance, certain glycan structures can serve as recognition signals for specific microbial adhesins or toxins, mediating host-microbe interactions that are essential for pathogenesis, commensalism, or mutualism. Secondly, bacterial glycans can also influence the immune response by interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells. This interaction can trigger various downstream signaling pathways, leading to activation of immune effector mechanisms or modulation of the immune response. Finally, microbial glycans can also play a role in the development and progression of certain diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders.","First, in addition to synthesizing surface structures, bacteria also produce intracellular glycans and cytoplasmic glycosylated proteins and glycolipids. For example, glycogen and trehalose act as storage compounds within some bacteria. Mycobacteria also contain a growing list of unusual glycosylated molecules, which may be related to their ability to withstand a variety of stresses. Second, bacteria produce a wide range of glycan-binding proteins. These include adhesins that facilitate bacterial colonization, exotoxins that bind to host membrane glycans, and single-sugar-binding proteins involved in metabolism (see Chapter 42). Third, bacterial lifestyles are often defined by their capacity to digest and/or metabolize glycans. Complex nanomachines have been described for the degradation of complex carbohydrate structures. Assembling the various enzymes into a highly organized complex affords synergy and efficiency. For example, the roles of glycosyl hydrolases in biomass conversion are well documented (Chapter 59).",0.75,0.5144910515182907,0.30121383225576015,0.7064054321088069,0.012658227848101266,0.19999999998,,0.0,0.19999999998,1.0,1.0,1.0

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'A third example is the formation of bony outgrowths (exostoses) in the growth plates of endochondral bones. In one background, heterozygous mutations in the Ext-1 copolymerase involved in HS biosynthesis cause infrequent exostoses, whereas in another background, the incidence of tumors increases severalfold. These experiments suggest the existence of modifiers that alter the expression level of an enzyme or the assembly of substrate, that salvage sugars from the diet, or that alter glycan turnover. In some mutants, phenotypes are only evident under environmental challenge. For example, deletion of both enzymes responsible for polysialic acid synthesis produces “no-fear” mice that tend to be more aggressive and ignore normally stressful or anxiety-producing situations. Deletion of syndecan-1, a major HS core protein (Chapter 17), gives no obvious changes under normal laboratory conditions, but the mice are more resistant to bacterial lung infections. Apparently, bacteria exploit the shed syndecan in the lung to enhance their virulence and modulate host defenses. Mice deficient in the synthesis of ganglioside GM3 appear to be normal except for enhanced insulin sensitivity, as well as deafness due to inner ear hair cell defects. These mice shunt glycosphingolipid synthesis toward more complex gangliosides that substitute for GM3 loss (Chapter 11). On the other hand, double-mutant mice that synthesize only ganglioside GM3 show tonic–clonic (epileptic) seizures, and 90% die because of seizures in response to sharp sounds. These examples show the importance of having the correct balance of glycans. They also show how phenotypes depend to a large extent on other genetic factors, diet, and environmental cues. Another major factor affecting the phenotype is now thought to be the microbiome, especially in the gut. Thus, mutations that appear silent in a controlled laboratory setting may elicit a strong phenotype in a more natural environment. Studies of humans and other primates have been limited by cost, ethical controversies, and (in the case of humans) genetically outbred populations. However, there are increasing examples in which findings (especially therapeutic ones) in mice fail to translate to the human conditions. Even chimpanzees (our closest relatives) seem to have markedly different disease profiles, some explained by alterations in sialic acid biology. Although ethically and practically feasible studies on other primates should continue, the late Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner has suggested (Chapter 7) that we now have enough information about humans to consider ourselves to be a viable “model organism” for in-depth study.

The cell wall of infectious forms of this fungus is covered with specific proteins and melanin, presumably to alter surface properties and mask these structures from recognition by host immune receptors. The hyphal wall has a core of branched β1-3-glucan covalently linked to other glucan components, chitin, and galactomannan, which consists of a mannose backbone with short galactofuranose side chains. Interestingly, galactomannan also occurs anchored to the plasma membrane by a GPI. This polysaccharide is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and is probably transferred to the cell wall by transglycosidases, in the same way as GPI-anchored proteins.",0.0,0.4782788985501057,0.36300091361081577,0.4525578625237951,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5).

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","This study has also benefited from the ability to manipulate glycosylation using RNA interference technology, allowing researchers to knockdown specific glycan-modifying enzymes or glycoproteins and observe the consequences for developmental and cellular processes.","Arthropods are among the most successful species on Earth and are found in all types of environments. One of their characteristic features is an exoskeleton composed of chitin, which provides support and physical protection. The best-studied example is the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. In 1910, T.H. Morgan published the first paper about the genetics of D. melanogaster, which showed that white eye color was a sex-linked trait. Since then, this organism has been the predominant model organism for genetic analysis in animals.

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand. The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Richard Cummings and Jeffrey Esko and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from T.N.C. Ramya and Gabriel Rabinovich.']","This phenomenon highlights the intricate mechanisms of sperm-egg interactions. The binding of bindin to EBR1 creates a strong foundation for fertilization, reminiscent of the binding between GBPs and their glycan ligands, where specific conformations enable optimal interactions. Just as lectins can recognize specific glycans, bindin likely exploits unique features on the surface of EBR1 to facilitate its binding, underscoring the importance of molecular recognition in biological processes.","Bindin is thought to recognize glycans on EBR1. EBR1 itself has lectin-like domains, but its glycan ligands are unknown. Most studies of glycosylation in sea urchins have identified glycosyltransferase activities and the glycans they synthesize (e.g., including N-glycans with antennal β1-3-linked Gal, β1-4GalNAc, Neu5Gc, and sulphate residues as well as traces of the “invertebrate” feature of core α1-3/α1-6-difucosylation) (Figure 27.2). The functions of glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) can be investigated using genetic strategies in sea urchins, antisense morpholinos or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down gene expression have been the methods of choice, but these will likely be superseded by more precise gene editing techniques such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) strategy or transcription activator–like effector (TALE) nucleases (TALENs).",0.25,0.6196378634933369,0.39058093913566116,0.7039156553896265,0.03125,0.699999999965,0.0,0.0,0.99999999998,1.0,1.0,1.0

 'Glycans are prepared to contain reactive primary amines at their reducing termini, but other chemical coupling methods are available. In addition, noncovalent immobilization can be used in which lipid-derivatized glycans or glycolipids are deposited onto nitrocellulose-coated slides. Also, neoglycoconjugates (e.g., glycans covalently attached to protein carriers as in neoglycoproteins) can be generated and then coupled to a surface to present glycans for interactions with GBPs. The glycans or glycan-containing materials are printed, much like DNA is printed for DNA microarrays, using contact printers or piezoelectric (noncontact) printing (Figure 29.6). Usually, a few nanoliters of solutions containing glycans in concentrations of 1–100 µm are deposited by a robotic printer on the glass surface in ∼100-µm-diameter spots. Slides are incubated for several hours to allow the chemical reactions to covalently fix the samples on the slides. The slides are then blocked to prevent nonspecific binding of reagents, and these microarrays overlaid with a buffer containing the GBP and incubated for several hours to allow equilibrium binding to occur. The slides are washed to remove unbound GBP and then analyzed. Analyses involve fluorescence detection, which means that either the GBP has to be directly fluorescent-labeled or a fluorescent-tagged antibody to the GBP must be used. Preparation of covalent glycan microarrays printed on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)- or epoxide-activated glass slides. In this example, the glycans have a free amine at the reducing end and are coupled to the glass slide. After washing to remove unattached (more...) The chief features of the successful microarrays are the variety of glycans they contain. However, the clustered and relatively high amount of glycans densely packed that can bind detectable amounts of GBPs, may also promote binding of even relatively low affinity multivalent GBPs. Thus, the density of the ligand should be taken into account when interpreting the results. The type of linker used and the state of the monosaccharide at the reducing end (i.e., open ring, open or closed ring form attached to the linker) can also affect binding. Binding is visualized or imaged as intensely fluorescent spots against a dark background. The data are visually imaged on a scanner and then graphically represented. In a typical successful analysis a GBP may bind to several glycans that share structural features, often termed glycan-binding determinants or motifs. If desired, the GBP can then be tested for its binding to the identified candidates by other methods such as titration microcalorimetry or fluorescence polarization, to define the Kd as discussed above. The use of microarrays in characterizing GBPs is a central component of functional glycomics (Chapter 51). Publicly available glycan microarray binding data repositories are increasingly used in the field. A variation of glycan microarrays is a bead-based Luminex-type assay. In this high-throughput approach glycans are covalently immobilized on Luminex beads of different fluorophore properties. Thus, a multiplexed approach is taken where a GBP is mixed with a set of conjugated beads each identifiable by its fluorescent properties. The GBP may be biotinylated, allowing detection by fluorescent streptavidin, or the GBP may be detected by binding to specific antibody or another reagent if the GBP is epitope-tagged. The degree of binding of the GBP is a measure of its affinity and specificity for a particular glycan. The advantages of this approach is that it is high-throughput, allowing thousands of assays to be performed automatically, as well as utilizing small amounts of both glycan and GBP. The collection of data and its analysis are also automated. A limitation of the approach is that each glycan to be derivatized must be activated by having a primary amine or other chemistry for conjugation, and each conjugation of a glycan needs to be independently validated. Multivalent GBPs interacting with multivalent ligands, as expressed on cells, can cause the cells to agglutinate. This can be exploited by allowing one to measure the ability of a soluble glycan to block the agglutination activity of the GBP. The concentration of the soluble glycan that provides 50% inhibition of agglutination is taken as the inhibitory concentration (IC50). Such approaches have been used for many years in studies on lectin-induced agglutination of cells and were useful in elucidating the nature of the human blood group substances.'

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs.

This process allows for the isolation and purification of specific glycans or glycoproteins that interact with the GBP of interest. The resulting sample can be analyzed by various methods such as mass spectrometry, chromatography, or Western blotting to identify the bound ligands.","The material bound to the bead-GBP may then be eluted for measurement and further analyses. Using this pull-down setup, one can perform a concentration-dependent binding assay to obtain an apparent Ka of the ligand for the immobilized GBP. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is one of the most rigorous means of defining the equilibrium binding constant between a glycan and a GBP or indeed any protein and its ligand. The binding of a glycan to the GBP is measured as a change in enthalpy using a commercial microcalorimeter. In this technique, a solution containing a glycan of interest is added in increments into a solution containing a fixed concentration of GBP. The glycan is added at many intervals and the heat evolved from binding is measured relative to a reference cell. Over the course of the experiment, the concentration of glycan is increased in the mixing cell over a glycan-to-GBP molar ratio of 0–10.

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Additional specificity can be conferred by the nature of the Sia moiety as well as sulfation of the underlying glycan.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","Here is a completed paragraph based on the provided context:

These proteins were initially referred to as S-type lectins to denote their sulfhydryl dependency, presence of free cysteine residues, and solubility, along with shared primary sequence. In the early 1980s, a 35-kDa protein termed CBP35 that also bound to β-galactosides was identified in mouse fibroblasts.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution.

With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

Carbohydrates are colored green and pale green (β- (more...) We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'In some cases, these latter lectins are encoded by separate but very similar genes. More than 100 of the seed legume L-type lectins have been characterized and are the most extensively studied proteins of this class. It also should be noted that the L-type fold has been observed in noncarbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectin-like receptor kinases in plants that are important in development and stress responses. A common feature of the legume L-type lectins is their monomeric structure. The structures of the monomers consist of three antiparallel β-sandwich: a flat six-stranded “back” sheet, a concave seven-stranded “front” sheet, and a short “top” sheet that keeps the two major sheets together (Figure 32.1A,B). All of these lectins require Ca++ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn++) for their carbohydrate-binding activity. The glycan-binding and metal-binding sites are localized in close proximity to each other at the top of the “front” sheet. The glycan-binding site is composed of four loops: A, B, C, and D (Figure 32.3, top). These loops contain four invariant amino acids that are essential for carbohydrate binding (Figure 32.3, bottom). Loop A contains an invariant aspartate, which forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain and the glycan ligand. This amino acid is linked to its preceding amino acid (usually alanine) by a rare cis-peptide bond, which is stabilized by the metal ions and is necessary for the proper orientation of the aspartate in the combining site. Loop B contains an invariant glycine, which also forms hydrogen bonds with the ligand. An exception to this case is found in two lectins (ConA and the closely related Dioclea grandiflora lectin) in which the glycine is replaced with an arginine. Both the glycine and arginine form hydrogen bonds with the ligand via their main-chain amides. Loop C contains an invariant asparagine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via its side chain, and an invariant hydrophobic amino acid. Besides these invariant amino acids, backbone atoms of the residues of loop D also contribute to monosaccharide recognition. (Top) Three-dimensional structure of a peanut agglutinin (PNA) monomer showing the four loops involved in sugar binding: loops A, B, C, and D. The bound sugar (lactose) is shown as a “ball-and-stick” model. Calcium and manganese ions are (more...) The legume L-type lectins are generally classified into groups based on their carbohydrate specificities as often identified by the ability of monosaccharides to inhibit their agglutinating activity. These differences in specificities are brought about by variability in the conformation and size of the D loop and to some extent by the C loop. Although the main specificity regions of the legume lectins are determined by the loops, there are sites other than these that contribute to lectin specificity. There are several additional modes of refining these specificities, such as interaction with water, posttranslational modifications, and state of oligomerization. Legume L-type lectins are oligomeric—mostly dimeric or tetrameric in nature—and adopt a variety of quaternary structures. The back β-sheet in the monomeric unit is involved in oligomerization. Small differences in the monomeric structure of the different legume lectins result in different modes of association of the β-sheet during oligomerization. For instance, although both ConA and PNA are tetrameric—being dimers of dimers—the quaternary association in ConA involves the association of the two six-stranded back β-sheets to form an extended 12-stranded β-sheet in each dimer, whereas the quaternary association in PNA involves a back-to-back arrangement of the back β-sheets. The tetrameric structure of ConA is shown in Figure 32.1C,D. Although some of the other lectins occur as dimeric and tetrameric structures, several other different orientations of the β-sheets account for the variability in dimeric and tetrameric structures of other lectins in this class. Interestingly, some legume lectins have a hydrophobic binding site that binds adenine and adenine-derived plant hormones with micromolar affinity; this is two to three orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for monosaccharides.'
 ""Even with low levels of viral exposure, C-type lectins on DCs trap and concentrate HIV for subsequent presentation to T cells, the main site of HIV replication. DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), mannose receptor, and Langerin are some of the C-type lectins that are important for this process. These lectins recognize dense arrays of mannose on pathogens including certain viruses (HIV, CMV [cytomegalovirus], hepatitis C virus, dengue virus), bacteria (Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Mycobacteria), fungi (Candida), and parasites (Leishmania, Schistosoma). Although T cells normally function to destroy pathogens and process their antigens for presentation, lectin-bound HIV evades destruction for extended periods. The natural role of DCs in presentation to T cells makes them ideal conduits for transmission of HIV to CD4+ T cells, in which CD4 and cytokine receptors support binding, fusion, and viral replication. This process is termed trans-infection and facilitates early establishment of the HIV infection. DCs are not the only cells co-opted by HIV; macrophages express the same lectins and may also facilitate trans-infection. Other host lectins on DCs and macrophages, such as Siglec-1 (Chapter 35) play a similar role in facilitating uptake of viruses with heavily sialylated envelopes. The nature of the relationship between microbes and the human host spans the spectrum from mutually beneficial (symbiotic), to benefiting the microbe without harming the host (commensal), to benefiting the microbe at the expense of the host (pathogenic). Glycans are key factors in the microbe–host interactions that occur along this continuum. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is an anaerobic bacterium that is a common member of the normal colonic microbiota in mice and humans. This microbe has evolved mechanisms to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with its mammalian host. A clue to this symbiosis came from examination of the gut epithelium of mice that are raised under germ-free conditions. Without bacterial exposure, the intestinal epithelium lacks expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates; when normal colonic bacteria are present, Fucα1-2Gal glycan expression is abundant on the surface of these host cells. B. thetaiotaomicron preferentially uses fucose both as an energy source and for incorporation into its own surface capsule and glycoproteins, phenotypes that are required for successful colonization and for proper immune development of the host. When dietary fucose is low, the bacterium induces the expression of host α1-2 fucosyltransferase, resulting in the expression of fucosylated (Fucα1-2Gal) glycoconjugates on the epithelium. B. thetaiotaomicron also expresses multiple fucosidases to cleave these terminal fucose residues and a fucose permease for uptake of the released sugar. Thus, the gut commensal has evolved a system for engineering the production of its own nutrient source from its host. This system is regulated for use only in times of need (during host fasting). B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved elaborate systems for regulating the expression of polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycosidases to forage and consume sugars from the host's diet or to switch over to glycans in the host mucus lining when sufficient polysaccharides are missing from the diet. Helicobacter pylori colonizes nearly half the world's population, but it triggers chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers (conditions that are known to increase the risk of stomach cancer) in a subset of these individuals. Glycans of both the host and microbe contribute to whether H. pylori persists as a benign commensal or triggers disease pathology. H. pylori expresses an adhesin (BabA) that can interact with terminal Lewis b blood group antigen-containing glycans of the gastric epithelium. Lewis b expression in human intestines is limited to mucus-producing pit cells in the gastric epithelium. Transgenic mice engineered to express Lewis b show enhanced binding of H. pylori to their gastric epithelium, which triggers an enhanced cellular immune response and more severe gastritis. This microenvironment of immune activation appears to set the stage for a glycan-based process of molecular mimicry that can promote further host cell damage.""
 'Treatment of lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase also abolished high-uptake activity. By this time, the general pathway for N-glycan processing had been defined (see Chapter 9). Because oligomannosyl N-glycans are rich in mannose residues, these were predicted to be phosphorylated on lysosomal enzymes. Indeed, the M6P moiety detected on oligomannosyl N-glycans was released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) from high-uptake forms of lysosomal enzymes, confirming the hypothesis. The groups of Stuart Kornfeld and Kurt von Figura then found, surprisingly, that some of the M6P moieties were “blocked” by α-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to the phosphate residue, creating a phosphodiester. Comparison of glycans with phosphodiesters and phosphomonoesters predicted that the metabolic precursor of the M6P determinant was a phosphodiester and that phosphorylation was mediated not by an ATP-dependent kinase but by a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This was proven using a double-labeled donor and Golgi extracts: Another Golgi enzyme phosphodiester glycosidase was shown to remove the outer N-acetylglucosamine residue and “uncover” the M6P moiety. Pulse-chase studies confirmed the order of events, documenting that multiple glycans on a given lysosomal enzyme could acquire one or two phosphate residues and that removal of some mannose residues on the N-glycan by processing Golgi mannosidases was also required (Figure 33.2). In most cell types, the phosphate is eventually lost after exposure to acid phosphatases 5 and 2 (ACP5, ACP2) in lysosomes. The overall biochemical pathway is shown in Figure 33.2. Pathways for biosynthesis of N-glycans bearing the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker. Following early N-glycan processing (Chapter 9), a single GlcNAc phosphodiester is added to the N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes on one of three mannose (Man) (more...) The first two enzymes that mediate these reactions were then purified and characterized and the encoding genes cloned. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-P-T) is an α2β2γ2 complex encoded by two genes. The α- and β-subunits are encoded by the GNPTAB gene, whose 1256 amino acid type-III transmembrane product undergoes proteolysis in the Golgi by site-1-protease (S1P) to give rise to the two subunits, whereas the 305 amino acid γ-subunit is encoded by the GNPTG gene (Figure 33.3). The α/β subunits contain the catalytic function of the enzyme (Stealth domains) as well as elements (Notch1, Notch2, and DMAP [DNA-methylase-associated protein]) that mediate binding to protein determinants present on the lysosomal enzymes. The γ-subunit facilitates the phosphorylation of a subset of the lysosomal enzymes. It contains an M6P receptor homology (MRH) domain that is thought to bind oligomannosyl N-glycans on the lysosomal enzymes and present them to the catalytic site for phosphorylation, and a DMAP recognition domain. The second enzyme, α-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester glycosidase encoded by the NAGPA gene, is a complex of four identical 68-kDa subunits, arranged as two disulfide-linked homodimers. Unlike other Golgi enzymes, this is a type-I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with its amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi. GlcNAc-P-T is an α2β2γ2 hexamer encoded by two genes. The GNPTAB gene encodes a catalytically inactive type 3 transmembrane precursor that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage between Lys-928 and Asp-929 in the Golgi by site-1-protease (more...) The oligomannosyl N-glycans of lysosomal enzymes are identical to those of many other glycoproteins passing through the ER–Golgi pathway. Thus, specific recognition by GlcNAc-P-T is crucial to achieve selective trafficking. This recognition is not explained by any similarities in the primary polypeptide sequences of lysosomal enzymes.'
 ""Note the alignment of positively (more...) Bacterial lectins occur commonly in the form of elongated multisubunit protein appendages, known as fimbriae (hairs) or pili (threads), which interact with glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on host cells. Similar to viral glycan-binding proteins, adhesin-receptor binding is generally of low affinity. Because the adhesins and the receptors often cluster in the plane of the membrane, the resulting combinatorial avidity can be great. An analogy for adhesin–receptor binding is the interaction of the two faces of Velcro strips. The most well-characterized bacterial lectins include the mannose-specific type-1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding F-17 fimbriae, which are produced by different strains of Escherichia coli. Fimbriated bacteria express 100 to 400 of these appendages, which typically have a diameter of 5–7 nm and can extend hundreds of nanometers in length (Figure 37.3) Thus, pili extend well beyond the bacterial glycocalyx comprised of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharides (see Chapter 21). Escherichia coli express hundreds of pili, as indicated by the fine filaments extending from the bacterium. (Reprinted, with permission of Elsevier, from Sharon N. 2006. Biochim Biophys Acta 1760: 527–537; courtesy of David L. Hasty, University (more...) Examination of a high-resolution, three-dimensional structure of FimH bound to mannose revealed that, although mannose exists as a mixture of α and β anomers in solution, only the former was found in the complex. Mannose binds FimH at a deep and negatively charged site of FimH (Figure 37.4). FimH has “catch-bond” properties, such that the binding strength of individual FimH adhesins is augmented by increasing the shear forces on surface-bound E. coli cells. This is relevant for urinary tract infections, in which type-1 fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia on the surface of bladder epithelial cells. Uroplakin Ia presents high levels of terminally exposed mannose residues that are capable of specifically interacting with FimH. Alternatively, type-1 fimbriae can bind to high mannose glycans on the soluble urinary Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein/uromodulin, that forms long fibers. The resulting bacterial aggregates are flushed out of the urinary tract. Mice lacking the gene encoding the Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein are considerably more susceptible to bladder colonization by type-1-fimbriated E. coli than normal mice.

FimH prefers to bind D-mannose in the (more...) Most bacteria (and possibly other microorganisms) have multiple adhesins with diverse carbohydrate specificities. Many of these have been described (examples in Table 37.2), wherein the specificity of lectin binding can help define the range of susceptible tissues in the host (i.e., the microbe's ecological niche). The columnar epithelium that lines the large intestine expresses receptors with Galα1–4Gal-Cer residues, whereas cells lining the small intestine do not. Thus, Bacterioides, Clostridium, E. coli, and Lactobacillus only colonize the large intestine under normal conditions. P-fimbriated E. coli and some toxins bind specifically to galabiose (Galα1–4Gal) and galabiose-containing oligosaccharides, most commonly as constituents of glycolipids. Binding can occur to either internal (i.e., when the disaccharide is capped by other sugars) or terminal nonreducing galabiose units. P-fimbriated E. coli adhere mainly to the upper part of the kidney, where galabiose is abundant. The fine specificity of bacterial surface lectins and their relationship to the animal tropism of the bacteria can be further illustrated by E. coli K99.""]","...by preventing aberrant glycosylation patterns that can trigger an immune response. This interaction may help maintain a stable pool of glycoproteins in the ER that can facilitate proper protein folding and maturation, thus preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can trigger an immune response.","The OST complex becomes dysfunctional in the presence of carboxy-terminal truncated TREX1. This leads to the release of free glycans from dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which has been hypothesized to lead to the activation of genes with immune system-related functions and the production of autoantibodies. Thus, TREX1 may safeguard the cell against free glycan buildup in the ER and thereby prevent glycan and glycosylation defects that can lead to immune disorders. N-linked glycans have a role in the correct folding of glycoproteins in the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process in which they are retrotranslocated into the cytosol (Chapter 39). The glycans are then released from the glycoprotein by the N-glycanase NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially de-mannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter.

Following birth, mammals produce milk containing an array of glycoproteins and a complex mixture of species-specific milk oligosaccharides (Chapter 14).","['Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'
 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

The causes of these lethal outcomes usually cannot be linked to specific glycoconjugates, but sometimes can be ascribed to a single mechanism such as the disruption of protein O-fucosylation, which impacts global Notch receptor signaling (Chapter 13).

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

MVB formation starts with inward budding of the limiting endosomal membrane. Lipids and proteins are sorted to either the internal or the limiting membrane. Ubiquitination of cargo proteins targets them to internal vesicles of MVBs, but ubiquitin-independent routes also exist. Intra-endosomal membranes and limiting endosomal membrane have different lipid and protein compositions. Membrane segregation and lipid sorting prepare the internal membranes for lysosomal degradation. During maturation of the internal membranes, cholesterol is continually stripped away (to <1%) and a negatively charged lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) increases up to 45%. This molecule is highly resistant to phospholipases. BMP also stimulates sphingolipid degradation on the inner membranes of acidic compartments. Because BMP is not present in the lysosomal outer membrane, the unique lipid profile ensures that degradation by hydrolases and membrane-disrupting SAPs occurs without digesting the lysosomal outer membrane. Degradation of glycans is not always complete.",1.0,0.5855491122507589,0.1536686851577777,0.6108128787259128,0.015625,0.8666666666377778,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.94999999997625,1.0,1.0,1.0

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac.

 'It has therefore been of interest to engineer more homogeneous α2-6-sialylation in cells. These efforts have mainly been limited to the overexpression of α2-6-sialyltransferases to override endogenous α2-3-sialylation with variable results, illustrating the complexity of engineering glycosylation in cells with competing pathways. An innovative glycoengineering strategy (GlycoDelete) reduced the inherent heterogeneity of mammalian N-glycan structures. Human HEK293-T cells lacking MGAT1 were stably transfected to express a fungal endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoT) that efficiently truncated N-glycans to a single GlcNAc, which was an acceptor for galactosylation and sialylation. Recombinant antibodies with truncated N-glycans had lower affinity for Fcγ receptors, suggesting that this glycoengineering strategy may be suitable for use with neutralizing antibodies. Deconstruction of the N-glycosylation pathway in CHO cells was performed by precise gene editing to knock out 19 glycosyltransferases, including all four α2-3-sialyltransferases that function on N-glycans (Figure 56.3). Combining knockout of St3gal4 and St3gal6 with site-specific knock-in of St6gal1 resulted in homogeneous α2-6-sialylation. Combinatorial knockout of all isoenzymes involved in N-glycan sialylation, galactosylation/LacNAc formation, branching, and core fucosylation has provided a design matrix for improving the homogeneity of N-glycans in CHO cells. A combination of five gene knockouts and the knock-in of St6gal1 created the glycoprotein therapeutic erythropoietin having homogeneous biantennary N-glycans with terminal α2-6-Neu5Ac. Wider engineering of almost all genes involved in N-glycosylation in CHO cells has shown that there are few limitations for engineering of glycosylation. For example, the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (Gnptab) that tags select oligomannose N-glycans on glycoproteins destined for lysosomal targeting was knocked out to produce lysosomal enzymes bearing complex-type sialylated glycans with extended blood circulation and improved biodistribution. (A) A complex N-glycan with glycosyltransferases responsible for each reaction. Combinatorial knockout of the glycosyltransferase isoenzyme genes indicated led to the identification of the primary genes (highlighted in bold) controlling N-glycan branching (more...) Therapeutic glycoprotein production still suffers from heterogeneity, including variations in which Asn residues are glycosylated (site occupancy, macroheterogeneity) and/or the diversity of mature glycan structures at any one site (microheterogeneity). This is currently addressed by ensuring reproducibility in batch-to-batch production through the use of highly standardized bioprocessing protocols, but this strategy is far from optimal. For example, incompletely sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins may be cleared by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell–Morell receptor), resulting in inconsistent circulatory half-lives of therapeutic glycoproteins (Chapter 34). Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sialylation by overexpressing relevant sialyltransferases as well as inhibiting or knocking out endogenous sialidases in host cells. Protein-specific glycosylation patterns and heterogeneity are more difficult to control. Nonhuman mammalian cell lines can produce two immunogenic nonhuman glycans: α1-3-Gal added to N-acetyllactosamine and Neu5Gc added to Gal or GalNAc (Chapters 14 and 15). The α1-3-galactosyltransferase and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydrolase genes responsible are inactive in humans. Although α1-3-Gal and Neu5Gc are not produced in CHO cells, both genes have been knocked out as a precaution. Even so, Neu5Gc scavenged from animal glycoproteins used in cell culture can appear in expressed glycoproteins, so use of defined media lacking nonhuman glycoproteins is also necessary. In engineering mammalian cell lines, it is important to consider that the glycosylation capacity is driven by the expression of a subset of available enzyme genes, but unexpressed genes can become activated. Thus, cell-specific glycosylation features are generally controlled by transcriptional regulation rather than mutations or gene aberrations.'
 'Although knockdown strategies have been successful for screening biological functions of glycogenes in multiple organisms (worms, flies, frogs, and zebrafish), these have generally not been effective in mammalian cells because of the low efficiency of knockdown. It is now possible to apply whole-glycogenome screening strategies in cell lines to probe and dissect the roles of glycosylation. These tools are dramatically improving options for dissection of structure–function relationships in the field. Glycoengineered cell lines and validated targeting constructs (knockout, knock-in, and mutated) including libraries for screening will become important community resources that will advance the glycoscience field and help disseminate and integrate glycosciences more broadly in biology. Large libraries of engineered isogenic cells with subtle differences of all types of glycosylation are available for dissection of glycan functions using different assays not limited to binding. Expanding these to organotypic tissue models is providing deeper insights. The ability to produce glycoproteins with a large variety of glycans opens up for unbiased testing of different glycoforms and determines the optimal design for therapeutic uses. Glycans can be custom designed, for example, to improve homogeneity, circulation time, targeting to select organs, or stimulating immunity. A word of caution, however: Whereas glycoengineering by knockout is fairly straightforward, there is still considerable work needed to establish methods to build robust complex glycosylation capabilities requiring multiple gene insertions in cells. Here, activation of endogenous genes in mammalian cells may provide a solution. Gene editing technologies caused a revolution in the glycoscience field, and we have only begun to see the new possibilities for manipulating glycosylation in cells and organisms and for exploiting glycoengineering in therapeutic glycoproteins and biologics. Finally, the well-established power and cost efficiency of using bacteria as reactors for production of proteins is now being harnessed to generate designer glycoproteins. There remains much to be explored in this rapidly developing area, but the potential is enormous.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

The resulting weak immune response (termed “xenosialitis”) can promote tumor growth by enhancing chronic inflammation and angiogenesis. Given this selective advantage, it is not surprising that tumors are better at accumulating Neu5Gc in the face of an increased immune response. Because the primary dietary source of Neu5Gc is red meat, this may help explain the increased cancer risk associated with its consumption.

Expression of these antigens by epithelial carcinomas correlates with metastatic potential in mice and with tumor progression, metastatic spread, and poor prognosis in humans.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'

The principle of this method is to introduce a stable substituent (an ether-linked methyl group) onto each free hydroxyl group of the native glycan.,"['Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells.

 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

 'Diagnostic fragment ions can sometimes be found confirming terminal epitopes such as a fucosylated Hex-HexNAc or sialylated fucosylated Hex-HexNAc (Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis x, respectively) but these cannot be distinguished from Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis a. Detailed glycan profiling achieved with site resolution (structure-focused glycoproteomics) is an important frontier that should be a goal of the next-generation of glycoproteomics. At this time, continued development of selective enrichment and/or preseparation of specific subsets of glycopeptides needs to be pursued, because no single LC-MSn method or instrument is sufficient to handle the full dynamic range of the entire glycopeptide pool derived from a complete glycoproteome. To limit the search space and enhance the detailed structural knowledge of the glycans encountered in a given glycoproteome, parallel profiling of the glycome can be performed. Such a “glycomics-assisted glycoproteomics” approach (Figure 51.2) can also be complemented with quantitative proteome and de-glycoproteome profiling (mapping of glycosylation sites), which reduce the search space even further and provide supporting evidence to pinpoint the mechanism(s) driving the observed glycoproteome alterations. Although glycoproteomics is rapidly maturing and continues to reach a larger group of scientists, significant analytical challenges remain and the technology is still best performed in “specialist” laboratories because of the demand for manual expert interrogation and interpretation of data. Current glycoproteomics methods cannot identify the full complement of glycans on every site of a mixture of glycoproteins and cannot easily tackle multiply glycosylated peptides especially with both N- and O-linked glycan structures. Defining the relative proportions of different intact glycoform populations is important for understanding biological function. This has only been achieved in a few cases (e.g., by MS analysis of the intact IgG glycoprotein). Several promising informatics initiatives aimed at automating the glycopeptide identification process, aiding the quantitation, and supporting the interpretation of the data output have appeared over recent years. A recent interlaboratory study conducted by the Human Glycoproteomics Initiative of HUPO highlights the importance of different software search parameters for the successful identification and characterization of glycopeptides in order to try to deal with false positives and the reporting of thousands of nonverified glycopeptides. At this stage, for most of the available glycopeptide identification software tools it is strongly advised that manual validation of the glycopeptide assignments still be performed to generate sufficient confidence in the reported identifications. It is therefore clear that the computational solutions require further improvements to advance the field of glycoproteomics and ultimately achieve full integration among other disciplines within the glycosciences (Chapter 52).

Bertozzi and Ram Sasisekharan and appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from Daron Freedberg and Chad Slawson.']",thereby converting them into quantifiable reporter groups that can be easily detected by mass spectrometry or other analytical methods.,"Glycosidic linkages are then cleaved by acid hydrolysis, producing partially methylated monosaccharides with free hydroxyl groups at the positions that were previously involved in a linkage. The partially methylated monosaccharides are ring-opened with a reducing agent (normally borodeuteride) to introduce a new hydroxyl group and, more importantly, a deuterium atom at C-1, which helps identify the reducing end of each monosaccharide. All the free hydroxyl groups are then acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) that can be identified by a combination of GC retention times and electron impact (EI)-MS (Figure 50.2). The masses of fragments produced by impact of high-energy electrons on PMAAs identify substitution sites in some cases, but fragmentation patterns of similarly substituted isomeric monosaccharides (e.g., Glc and Gal) can be nearly identical. Thus, definitive identification of monosaccharides requires, in addition to the analysis of the MS pattern, a comparison of GC retention times with those of known standards (e.g., all peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-hexoses produce the same EI-MS spectrum, but peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-galactitol elutes later than peracetylated 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol). This type of analysis identifies terminal residues (they are methylated at every position except the hydroxyl group at C-1 and the ring oxygen), indicates how each monosaccharide is substituted, including the occurrence of linkage and branching points, and allows the determination of the ring size (pyranose [p] or furanose [f]) for each monosaccharide.",0.0,0.47223647814900166,0.5425814048720788,0.6713425429145341,0.04411764705882353,0.4499999999775,,0.0,0.4499999999775,1.0,1.0,1.0

Many proteins interact with each other through specific binding events, such as those involving lectins and their corresponding glycans. In these cases, the binding event itself can be influenced by factors like conformational entropy, clustering, and the presence of certain ligands or carriers. As a result, understanding protein function often requires consideration of both the individual protein's properties and its interactions with other proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in specific biological contexts.","These modifications, combined with alternative RNA splicing in eukaryotes, render the proteome considerably more complex than the transcriptome. Although it has been estimated that approximately 120,000 different protein splice forms are expressed by human cells, the total number of modified proteoforms is likely to be at least an order of magnitude higher. The systems-level analysis of all proteins expressed by cells, tissues, or organisms is known as “proteomics.” The proteome, like the transcriptome, but unlike the DNA sequence of the genome, is fundamentally dynamic. The repertoire of proteins expressed by a cell is highly dependent on tissue type, microenvironment, and stage within the life cycle. As cells receive external and internal cues in the form of growth factors, hormones, metabolites, or cell–cell interactions, the expression of various genes is modulated and may be transcribed at levels ranging from silence to more than 104 mRNA copies per cell and 107 protein molecules per cell. Thus, proteomes and their modifications vary during cell differentiation, activation, trafficking, and malignant transformation. However, no systems-level analysis of a biological process is complete without interrogating the glycome, defined as the entire complement of glycan structures (be it protein-/lipid-bound or -free) produced by cells, in addition to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome.",0.5,0.515973484923051,0.35280215505068346,0.8123675931994696,0.015625,0.9999999999,,0.0,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,1.0

The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac.

To address this problem, a number of international efforts are underway to establish standards for the presentation of glycomics data, thereby facilitating data comparison, exchange, and verification.","Another effort, GlycoRDF, is a proposed standard ontology for glycan and related metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide consistent terminologies for representing glycan sequences, related biological sources, publications, and experimental data on the Semantic Web. GlycoRDF is now being used by several glycomics database providers, to enable large-scale integration of diverse data collections in the glycosciences. For example, GlyTouCan uses the GlycoRDF ontology to represent the registered data such that other data resources also using this ontology can be integrated and queried by glycan structure. Different information resources (e.g., databases and publications) can reference these identifiers, thus facilitating identification and interpretation of diverse but complementary data sets that embody information about specific glycan structures. The Semantic Web is a new technology that provides a framework for making data available directly on the Internet, provided with semantics, such that inferences can be made automatically based on the data. For example, a researcher often refers to various publications to derive a new hypothesis to test. Using the Semantic Web, the data in the publications would be formatted in such a way (using predefined vocabulary, or ontologies) that the meaning behind the data is preserved in a computable form, on the Web. Because a common vocabulary, or ontology, would be used across different publications in different websites (i.e., journals), the terminology used to encapsulate the semantics is preserved.",0.0,0.5985599640590601,0.28544349572518635,0.6802879615405887,0.017543859649122806,0.8041666666465626,0.2,0.0,0.8041666666465626,0.0,1.0,1.0
52,"Complete the following paragraph: Pure glycans of defined structure are essential research tools in glycobiology. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, which can be obtained in homogeneous forms by recombinant expression and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, glycans produced in biological systems are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the quantities that can be obtained from biological systems are often small. Chemical synthesis can be used to obtain homogeneous glycans in larger quantities than are available from most cellular production systems. Chemical synthesis can be further employed to incorporate glycans into homogeneous glycoproteins. This chapter summarizes the current state of the art in chemical methods to produce glycans.","['Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5). Other examples include polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes bound to their polymeric products as well as integral membrane transporters associated with lipopolysaccharide substrates.

We can thus look forward to correlating unprecedented structural insights on protein glycosylation and complex carbohydrate interactions with biochemical, functional, spectroscopic, and in silico approaches in the coming years. Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'

 'Glycans favoring cell motility (e.g., polysialic acid) will be favored for development but become detrimental when accidentally exploited by malignant cells. Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

The structure of oligosaccharides render their synthesis more complicated than the synthesis of the other major classes of biomolecules: oligonucleotides and oligopeptides. Fundamental challenges of glycan synthesis are the requirement for modifying one specific hydroxyl group in the presence of many others, and control over the stereochemical outcome in the creation of a glycosidic linkage. Commonly, glycan synthesis is characterized by the manipulation of various protecting groups, chemical moieties that mask the hydroxyl groups and prevent them from reacting with other chemical reagents. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are selectively added and removed from glycan structures, allowing for chemical alteration of the exposed hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, in a typical glycan synthesis scheme, the exposed hydroxyl group serves as a point for further elaboration. The selective exposure of one hydroxyl group allows for regioselective addition of another saccharide unit. Synthetic schemes of this type are commonly applied to the generation of O- and N-linked glycans (see Chapters 9 and 10) as well as proteoglycans (see Chapter 17) and glycosphingolipids (see Chapter 11).

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D.

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications. Analyses of fully glycosylated viral envelope proteins are fascinating examples that document the potential of cryo-EM for studying protein–carbohydrate interactions (Figure 30.5).

All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation.

A major challenge associated with viral neuraminidase inhibitors—most strikingly, Tamiflu—is the rapid development of mutations that confer resistance. An alternative approach to circumvent this problem has been to develop mechanism-based inhibitors that covalently inhibit the enzyme. One example, FaxGuDFSA, has a fluoride leaving group, the displacement of which by the neuraminidase forms a glycosyl–enzyme intermediate.

Glycans on reproductive tract secretions favoring survival of sperm (e.g., Glycodelin S) might be counter-selected in females who benefit from a different glycan form (Glycodelin A), which challenges male gametes as part of female quality control. Unique glycans evolved as reliable SAMPs can become a liability if exploited by pathogens through molecular mimicry. Given the rapid evolution of extrinsic pathogens and their frequent use of glycans as targets for host recognition, it seems likely that a significant portion of the overall diversity in vertebrate cell-surface glycan structure reflects such pathogen-mediated selection processes. Meanwhile, even one critical intrinsic role of a glycan could disallow its elimination as a mechanism to evade pathogens. Thus, glycan expression patterns may represent trade-offs between evading pathogens (or accommodating symbionts) and preserving intrinsic functions. More gene disruption studies in intact animals could help differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic glycan functions. More systematic comparative glycobiology could also contribute, making predictions about intrinsic glycan function—that is, the consistent (conserved) expression of the same structure in the same cell type across several taxa would imply a critical intrinsic role. Such work might also help define the rate of glycan diversification during evolution, better define the relative roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic selective forces, and eventually lead to a better understanding of the functional significance of glycan diversification during evolution. The possibility that pathogen-driven glycan diversification might even favor the process of sympatric speciation (via reproductive isolation) also needs to be further explored.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.'

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself. Examples include P-selectin, which binds to sialyl Lewis x adjacent to sulfated tyrosines on the PSGL-1 protein of leukocytes (see above) and E-selectin, which binds to the same glycan on a variant form of the protein CD44 on hematopoietic stem cells (designated HCELL). Although the concept that GBPs bind glycans in the context of their carriers is well-established, there is no standard terminology to designate a particular glycoform as the ligand for a GBP. For example, stating that a protein (e.g., PSGL-1 or CD44) is “the ligand” for a GBP (P-selectin and E-selectin, respectively) is inaccurate, in that the protein without the specific glycan is not actually a ligand. On the other hand, giving a ligand a completely different name (e.g., HCELL) does not identify the polypeptide carrier. A suggested option is to use a superscript “L” (ligand) to designate these molecules as PSGL-1PSL and CD44ESL, respectively. This suggested terminology also has the advantage of distinguishing different glycoforms of the same polypeptide as ligands for different GBPs. For example, subsets of the glycoprotein CD24 recognized by P-selectin and Siglec-10 can be designated as CD24PSL and CD24S10L, respectively. Regardless of the nomenclature used, direct proof of a functional interaction in vivo is needed to definitively assign a particular glycoprotein or glycolipid as a physiological GBP ligand.

The specificity of the enzymes is crucial to avoid off-target degradation of normal cells or tissues.","The success of glucocerebrosidase treatment stimulated the development of lysosomal enzymes for treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses type I, II, and VI, and Pompe's disease. The replacement therapies clearly have beneficial effects and prolong life but are extremely expensive. A third approach for treating lysosomal storage disorders takes advantage of the fact that some genetic defects lead to misfolding of the encoded enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Low-molecular-weight competitive inhibitors of some of these enzymes can act as “chaperones,” which stabilize the folded enzyme in the ER and effectively rescue the mutation and increase the steady state concentration of active enzyme in the lysosome. The dose of the inhibitor must be carefully adjusted to ensure that the inhibitory effects on enzyme function do not overshadow beneficial effects on folding. Only a low level of enzyme restoration is needed to significantly reduce the accumulation of undigested glycan substrates, indicating that lysosomal hydrolases are normally present in large catalytic excess.",0.0,0.4616168198900586,0.30230131411785127,0.8092305752742872,0.015625,0.9999999999,,0.0,0.32499999998375,1.0,1.0,1.0

 'Information about these is available in Further Reading. With the development of direct electron detectors, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most powerful techniques to obtain high-resolution structural information on biological macromolecules. With reported resolutions exceeding 2 Å, many molecular details are revealed under native-like conditions. By eliminating the need for growing well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) crystals and operating at fairly low sample concentrations, cryo-EM can provide atomic level insights into many biological samples, from soluble and membrane-integrated protein complexes to filamentous polymers and entire viruses. Cryo-EM can be roughly divided into two main directions: one working with single (usually purified) particles, single-particle analysis (SPA), and the other using a tomography approach to analyze species in larger assemblies, such as in vitro–assembled scaffolds or even native cells and tissues. For SPA, samples are generally analyzed in a thin layer of vitreous ice containing the particles in random orientations. Data is collected in the form of movies, which allows correction for beam-induced drift, followed by estimation of the contrast transfer function for each micrograph; both are necessary to obtain near-atomic resolutions. The individual particles are then computationally extracted from the micrographs, sorted, and ultimately aligned in three dimensions to reconstruct the molecular structure. For cryo-electron tomography of, for example, a vitrified cell or virus particle, a tilt series of images is acquired to obtain different “specimen views” necessary for 3D reconstruction. This technique continues to face technical challenges, in part because of limitations on the tilt angles that can be achieved. However, it is a powerful tool to image, for example, the glycocalyx of various tissues, plant and fungal cells walls, or microbial cell envelopes and capsules. A major advantage of cryo-EM is that sample heterogeneity and/or conformational flexibility does not preclude analyses. To obtain well-diffracting crystals of a glycosylated protein, for example, the conformationally heterogenous glycans are often removed enzymatically to facilitate crystallization. For cryo-EM, these pretreatments are generally unnecessary, thereby providing molecular details of proteins in the context of posttranslational modifications.

Experimental structural information obtained by crystallographic, NMR, and cryo-EM methods have clearly been of value in building an understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to glycan recognition by proteins. However, systems in which interactions are of interest far outnumber the cases in which these methods can be applied. Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve.

 'Reg3α (also known as HIP/PAP) is a secreted CTL that an amino-terminal signal sequence and a 16 kDa CTLD. Reg3α is an anti-inflammatory protein with scavenging activity toward ROS and can bind peptidoglycan and directly kill Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria. Reg3α kills bacteria by first binding to peptidoglycan and then binding to membrane phospholipids and forms a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. Lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and some viruses also contain CTLDs. The galactose-specific lectin from Crotalus atrox binds a variety of galactose-containing glycolipids in a Ca++-dependent fashion. A number of related venom proteins inhibit platelet function and/or the coagulation cascade. Alboaggregin A from the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) binds to the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex and stimulates platelet agglutination, but the potential role of glycan recognition in this process is unclear. In contrast, the gp42 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has a CTLD that is NK-receptor like, and ectodomain of the poxvirus (Poxviridae) protein A33, a target of subunit vaccine development, has two CTLDs in dimeric form, and has resemblance to the CTLDs of the NK lectins. But, neither of these domains in these viral proteins binds either Ca++ or glycans, and may have evolved by convergent evolution. The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Robert Sackstein.'

 'Because lectins typically interact with a single conformation, there is an entropic penalty associated with binding any one of these which may be reduced when the glycan has fewer potential conformations. In vitro biochemical assays, including glycan arrays, reflect only some of these types of clustering of CRDs and ligands, so they must be interpreted with some caution. In some cases, binding of a CRD to isolated glycans may be essentially undetectable even though binding of the intact CRD-containing protein to its endogenous glycoconjugate may be highly selective and quite strong. Care must also be exercised in use of the term “ligand,” to distinguish the glycan part of a ligand from the entire natural glycoconjugate or even cell surface. Based on the above considerations, GBPs may bind optimally to a glycan only when it is conjugated to a particular protein or lipid. In such instances, the GBP ligand is neither the glycan by itself nor the carrier by itself.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","These glycopolymers have the potential to mimic complex interactions between proteins and glycans, enabling the development of novel biomaterials with tailored properties for various applications.","Such materials have found increasing use as research tools to study the biological functions of glycans and are currently explored as biomaterials for drug delivery or as antifouling and antifreeze agents.

Most crystal structures contain either small ligands or yield useful electron densities for only parts of larger ligands. The same is true to a certain extent for cryo-EM structures. NMR methods, although giving detailed information on bound ligand geometries, frequently give only qualitative information on parts of ligands or protein that are in intimate contact with each other. All three methods require substantial effort, particularly in preparing samples for investigation. A particular problem for glycans of interest is that they are often complex molecules that are difficult to prepare in highly pure forms or in the quantities needed for experimental investigation. There are also functionally important dynamic processes (e.g., enzymatic conversions of glycan substrates to products and transport of glycans) that are not well-represented by static, thermodynamically stable structures. Computational methods can extend analyses into these less accessible regions of structural investigation. Computational contributions to our understanding of glycan properties have a long history, beginning with a very fundamental understanding of factors influencing anomeric configuration and glycosidic torsion angles. These glycan-specific factors, such as the anomeric effect and the exo-anomeric effect, are described more thoroughly in Chapters 2, 3, and 50.'
 'For example, the name of the closed ring Neu5Ac is 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid. Beyond the currently known core units (Figure 15.1), additional substitutions are designated by letter codes (Ac, acetyl; Gc, glycolyl; Me, methyl; Lt, lactyl; and S, sulfate), and these are listed along with numbers indicating their location relative to the carbons (e.g., 9-O-acetyl-8-O-methyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid is Neu5,9Ac28Me). Among NulOs as a whole, there are now at least 138 known structural variants. If one is uncertain of the exact type of molecule present, the generic abbreviations Sia or NulO should be used. Partial structural information can also be incorporated. For example, a Sia of otherwise unknown type with an O-acetyl substitution at the C-9 position could be written as Sia9Ac. With regard to the bacterial NulOs, the names Leg, Pse, 4eLeg, 8eLeg, and Aci are often used synonymously with the 5,7-di-N-acetylated forms of these molecules (Figure 15.1). To be consistent with Sia nomenclature (as with Neu) and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the substituted forms be specified whenever possible (e.g., Leg5,7Ac2). Free amino forms of the prokaryotic NulOs have not to our knowledge been reported in nature. Instead, many different types of substitutions of the C-5 and C-7 positions have been reported for the exclusively prokaryotic NulOs, including acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), methyl (Me), D-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-D-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), L-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups. Additional variety derives from acetyl groups at O4 and O8, as well as acetyl, N-acetyl-glutaminyl (GlnNAc), and glycyl (Gly) substitutions at O8.

 'Adhesin–glycan binding triggers invasion of the merozoites into red blood cells, where they develop into mature schizonts that rupture and release newly formed merozoites into the bloodstream. Many commonly used clinical antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine, target the parasite during this erythrocytic asexual reproduction stage. Various glycan-binding proteins mediate adhesion of microorganisms to host cells or tissues. These interactions are often a prerequisite for infection or symbiosis, with binding-deficient mutants being unable to initiate or maintain these relationships. Interestingly, glycans recognized by microbial surface lectins have been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to animal cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus may protect animals against infection by such microorganisms. For example, coadministration of methyl α-mannoside with type-1-fimbriated E. coli into the bladder of mice can reduce microbial burden in a mouse model of urinary tract infection, whereas methyl α-glucoside, which does not bind to FimH, has no effect. Furthermore, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and its α2-3- and α2-6-sialylated derivatives block the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, these glycans prevent colonization of the nasopharynx and attenuate the course of pneumonia in rodent models of pneumococcal infection. Naturally occurring host glycans can also serve protective roles. For example, secreted mucins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) act as natural receptor decoys, protecting the host from pathogens and shaping the microbiota composition. Exogenous heparin and structurally related polysaccharides are known to inhibit viral replication, suggesting a potential approach for the development of polysaccharide-based antiviral pharmaceutical agents. For example, heparin octasaccharide decoy liposomes were recently shown to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses including HSV and respiratory syncytial virus. As more crystal structures are elucidated, the ability to design small molecule inhibitors that fit into the carbohydrate-recognition domains of adhesins should improve. Already, the structures of influenza hemagglutinin and sialidase have suggested numerous ways to modify sialic acid to fit better into the active sites. Some of these compounds are presently in clinical use to limit the spread of influenza. The authors acknowledge contributions to the previous version of this chapter from Jeffrey D. Esko, Victor Nizet, and the late Nathan Sharon and helpful comments and suggestions from Frederique Lisacek and Ajit Varki.'

This chapter illustrates and discusses some key mechanisms by which glycans influence the pathogenesis and progression of bacterial and viral infections and describes examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Infectious diseases remain a major cause of death, disability, and social and economic disorder for millions of people throughout the world. Poverty, poor access to health care, human migration, emerging disease agents, and antibiotic resistance all contribute to the expanding impact of these illnesses. Prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases are derived from a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between specific viral or bacterial pathogens and the human (or animal) host. Just as glycans are major components of the outermost surface of all animal and plant cells, so too are oligosaccharides and polysaccharides found on the surfaces of all bacteria and viruses of eukaryotes. Thus, most (if not all) interactions of microbial pathogens with their hosts are influenced to an important degree by the pattern of glycans and glycan-binding receptors that each expresses. This holds true at all stages of infection, from initial colonization of host cell surfaces, to tissue spread, to the induction of inflammation or host cell injury that results in clinical symptoms. The microbial molecules most responsible for disease manifestations are known as virulence factors. A human in good health is colonized by as many as 1013 bacteria on the skin and mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, a number that resembles the number of cells in our own body. Despite all these direct and continuous encounters, it is relatively rare that bacteria invade into the tissues to produce serious infections. Although not restricted to pathogenic species/strains, one feature shared by many of these disease-causing agents is the presence of diverse polysaccharide capsule structures, which encapsulate bacteria (Chapter 21). These structures can have many biological properties, both stimulating and thwarting immune detection in different settings. Capsules make key contributions to the virulence of multiple bacterial pathogens, reducing recognition by the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, capsular polysaccharides are also commonly the natural targets of the adaptive immune system. In fact, antibodies specific to different capsule structures often define the serology used to differentiate subtypes of particular bacterial species. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) encodes perhaps the most historically significant capsule in biology and medicine. Pioneering experiments by Frederick Griffith in 1928 showed the in vivo transfer of virulence from a dead encapsulated (smooth) disease-causing strain to an avirulent, nonencapsulated (rough) strain. Studies regarding immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharides (Figure 42.1) provided the framework for the discoveries of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, which showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information. Classical experiments on the role of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule in virulence. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) strains can be identified with either a “rough” (R) or a “smooth” (S) phenotype, the latter being (more...) Killing of bacteria by phagocytes of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils or macrophages, is aided by opsonization, a process in which the bacterial surface is tagged with complement proteins or specific antibodies. Phagocytes express receptors for activated complement and antibody Fc domains, allowing them to bind, engulf, and kill bacteria. Together these processes are referred to as opsonophagocytosis. Genetic mutagenesis of capsule biosynthesis genes and infectious challenge in small animal models have illustrated the roles of bacterial capsules in resisting opsonophagocytosis. Compared with the wild-type parent bacterial strains, isogenic capsule-deficient mutants of group A Streptococcus (GAS), group B Streptococcus (GBS), pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), and several other important human pathogens are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by opsonophagocytosis and fail to establish systemic infection.']","Their applications in medicine, including diagnosis, therapy, and vaccine development, are being explored.","Given all these major advances in basic and applied research on glycans, there is no reason why this major class of biomolecules should continue to be the “dark matter of the biological universe.” However, since the 1980s an entire generation of scientists have been largely trained without much exposure to, or knowledge of, glycans. Thus, it will still be awhile before these molecules return to their rightful place in the mainstream of thinking in conventional molecular and cellular biology and medicine. Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the United States has recognized the importance of training scientists and clinicians in glycosciences by establishing a National Career Development Consortium for Excellence in Glycosciences (K12), which focuses on immersive training of medical and research professionals in all aspects of glycosciences. In addition, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has funded the first graduate student training grant (T32) in glycosciences. Clearly, the teaching of glycosciences in all training programs for graduate and medical professionals will be essential if we are to continue to make medical advances in nearly all areas. As emphasized in a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, nearly every disease process that affects humans and other animals involves glycans (Chapters 39–47). In past decades, it has been realized that most functions of complex glycans are required at the multicellular (organismic) level. In contrast, cycling monosaccharides (e.g., O-GlcNAc in the nucleus and cytoplasm) serve regulatory functions at the single-cell level. The significance of nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation was broadened by the discoveries that an evolutionary branch of O-GlcNAc transferase is in fact an O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) that modifies many proteins in plants, protists, and protist pathogens like Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, with O-Fuc instead of O-GlcNAc (Chapters 18 and 19). The critical roles of complex glycans in the biology of intact organisms have been dramatically illustrated by the contrast between the viability of glycosyltransferase mutant cell lines in culture (Chapter 49) with the often lethal outcome caused by inactivation of the same enzymes in living organisms (Chapter 41). Transgenic mouse studies and the severe phenotypes of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (Chapter 45) have dramatically revealed the critical importance of glycans in development, physiology, and disease. Most major diseases also involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other glycan-binding proteins (Chapters 34–36) play critical roles. Most pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites gain entry to cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface (Chapters 42 and 43). Recently, many studies have shown an essential role for complex glycans in SARS-CoV-2 infections and a role for O-GlcNAcylation in viral-induced cytokine storms (Chapter 19). In addition, many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic. Notch signaling, which plays a major role in controlling morphogenesis in development and cell fate decisions, is controlled by glycans (Chapter 13), and glycans on the surface of tumor cells play critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis (Chapter 47). Many of the current therapeutics in use or under development are glycoproteins, like monoclonal antibodies, which often require particular types of N-glycans for functional efficacy. Defects in the synthesis of glycan chains on dystroglycan underlie many types of congenital muscular dystrophy (Chapter 45). Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiologies of diabetes, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Chapter 19). Although the few scientists and physicians well-educated in glycobiology are acutely aware of the importance of glycans in disease, most others have not learned much about this major class of molecules. However, it is now clear that studies of glycans will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies.",,,,0.5915014518789716,0.0,0.99999999998,,0.0,0.8041666666465626,,,
