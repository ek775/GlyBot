""What role does TREX1 play in safeguarding the cell against immune disorders and free glycan buildup?""

This question is formed using the topic ""Immune system"" as specified by the keyphrase. The context provides information about how TREX1 regulates innate immunity, interacts with the OST complex, and prevents the release of free glycans, which can lead to immune disorders.","['Many of these claims are based on incomplete evidence (Chapter 18). One possibility is that there are indeed glycans in these unexpected locations, but that their true structures are novel. Conversely, although structural evidence might be strong, there may be inadequate evidence to be certain about the topology of the claimed structures. Regardless, past experience tells us that the cell biology of glycosylation can hold many surprises, and dogmatic positions about such controversial issues are not warranted. Like all components of living cells, glycans constantly turn over. Some glycoconjugates, such as transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, turn over by shedding from the cell surface through limited proteolysis. Most glycoconjugate turnover occurs by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Endoglycosidases can initially cleave glycans internally, producing substrates for exoglycosidases in the lysosome. Once broken down, individual monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytoplasm, so that they can be reused (Figure 1.8, Chapter 1). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, glycans of the nucleus and cytoplasm may be more dynamic and rapidly turned over (Chapters 18 and 19). Glycans in bacterial cells (especially those in the cell wall) also turn over during cell division when the cell wall undergoes cleavage and remodeling.

 'When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology?  As with other fields like protein sciences, there will always be a small cadre of investigators whose primary interest is in the structure, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology of glycans.

As our understanding of the functions of glycans increases, biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA.

 'A third example is the formation of bony outgrowths (exostoses) in the growth plates of endochondral bones. In one background, heterozygous mutations in the Ext-1 copolymerase involved in HS biosynthesis cause infrequent exostoses, whereas in another background, the incidence of tumors increases severalfold. These experiments suggest the existence of modifiers that alter the expression level of an enzyme or the assembly of substrate, that salvage sugars from the diet, or that alter glycan turnover. In some mutants, phenotypes are only evident under environmental challenge. For example, deletion of both enzymes responsible for polysialic acid synthesis produces “no-fear” mice that tend to be more aggressive and ignore normally stressful or anxiety-producing situations. Deletion of syndecan-1, a major HS core protein (Chapter 17), gives no obvious changes under normal laboratory conditions, but the mice are more resistant to bacterial lung infections. Apparently, bacteria exploit the shed syndecan in the lung to enhance their virulence and modulate host defenses. Mice deficient in the synthesis of ganglioside GM3 appear to be normal except for enhanced insulin sensitivity, as well as deafness due to inner ear hair cell defects. These mice shunt glycosphingolipid synthesis toward more complex gangliosides that substitute for GM3 loss (Chapter 11). On the other hand, double-mutant mice that synthesize only ganglioside GM3 show tonic–clonic (epileptic) seizures, and 90% die because of seizures in response to sharp sounds. These examples show the importance of having the correct balance of glycans. They also show how phenotypes depend to a large extent on other genetic factors, diet, and environmental cues. Another major factor affecting the phenotype is now thought to be the microbiome, especially in the gut.

 'Dolichol-P serves an analogous function in eukaryotic cells (Chapter 9). Dolichol-P-mannose provides all of the mannose for glycophospholipid anchors, C-mannosylated proteins, O-mannose-based chains, and four of the mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide used for N-glycan biosynthesis. Dolichol-P-glucose provides glucose for the mature N-linked glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, which itself is built on dolichol pyrophosphate (dolichol-PP). The formation of dolichol-P involves elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate with multiple cis-isopentenyl pyrophosphate units. The total number of isoprene units can vary, from typically 11 in bacteria (making a C55 bactoprenol chain) to up to 21 in mammals. In eukaryotes, the double bond nearest the pyrophosphate must be reduced for the carrier to be functional in glycosylation. Studies in yeast, mice, and humans indicate that direct reduction of polyprenol to dolichol is a major pathway, but an alternate pathway must also exist. It is unclear whether the phosphates are removed before or after the reduction step. The evolutionary significance of the different chain lengths and reduction of the double bond is not known. Dolichol is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent dolichol kinase to generate dolichol-P as needed. Because dolichol, dolichol-P, and dolichol-PP are all generated from a common metabolically stable pool, they must be recycled and interconverted as needed. Dolichol occurs in the ER and Golgi and turns over very slowly. The finding that disruptions in nucleotide sugar metabolism underpin disease resulted in an influx of data, expanding our knowledge of the signaling pathways controlling nucleotide sugar flux, highlighting noncanonical roles for nucleotide sugars, and identifying new drugs for modulating metabolism. The map of biosynthetic and signaling pathways regulating nucleotide sugars is incomplete, especially with respect to tissue specificity, development, nutrient availability, and stress. New approaches to study metabolic flux and assess or modulate nucleotide sugar levels in an organelle- or cell-specific manner, as well as structural insight into nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases, are providing more clarity. Innovations in isotopic labeling of metabolites, mass spectrometry methods, genetic and chemical biosensors of nucleotide sugars, and cryo-electron microscopy hold great promise in this area.

Lefeber and Stephan von Gunten.']","The factors that contribute to the limited subset of glycan structures found in eukaryotic cells include:

1. The types of sugar residues present: Eukaryotes have a limited set of sugar residues, such as glucose, galactose, and mannose, which are used to form glycans.
2. The enzymes involved in glycosylation: Eukaryotes have a specific set of enzymes that catalyze the addition of sugar residues to proteins and lipids, leading to the formation of glycans with specific structures.
3. The regulation of glycan synthesis: Glycan synthesis is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells, which limits the diversity of glycan structures that can be formed.

These differences impact the diversity of glycosylation pathways in bacteria and archaea in several ways:

1. Bacteria have a broader range of sugar residues: Bacteria have a wider variety of sugar residues than eukaryotes, including pentoses, hexoses, and amino sugars.
2. Bacteria have different enzymes: Bacteria have distinct enzymes that catalyze glycosylation reactions, leading to the formation of glycans with unique structures.
3. Bacteria have different regulatory mechanisms: Glycan synthesis is regulated differently in bacteria than in eukaryotes, which allows for a greater diversity of glycan structures.

 'Some diversity results from a larger set of sugar residues, some from branching, and some from modification with a wide variety of substituents, such as phosphate, sulfate, acyl, and amino groups. This diversity gives rise to different physical properties. It allows bacteria to mimic their hosts in an attempt to evade detection, and it provides a means of distinguishing self from competitive organisms. Structures discussed in this chapter are depicted in abbreviated IUPAC/IUBMB (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) form in Table 3.1 for comparison to the common names, symbolic representations, and actual chemical structures used in the text and figures. This chapter serves as a preview of glycans discussed more thoroughly in the following chapters.

 'GAGs found in other animals can be distinct from mammalian GAGs by virtue of further modifications. For example, marine invertebrates can carry particularly unique sulfation patterns (i.e., 3-O-sulfation on GlcA residues) and distinct side-chain modifications (i.e., fucosylation on chondroitin sulfate). Structures of (A) disaccharide repeating units of different glycosaminoglycans and (B) the conformations of monosaccharides from heparan sulfate.  GAGs show biological function primarily through their interactions with the hundreds of GAG-binding proteins found on cellular surfaces and in extracellular spaces. The structural factors that affect the strength and specificity of binding are key to the elicitation of a proper biological response. HS, the most studied member of the GAG family, provides a good illustration of the wide range of physiological and pathophysiological functions affected. HS, for example, is involved in trimolecular interactions with growth factors and growth factor receptors, and thereby participates in regulating embryonic development. HS interacts with proteases and protease inhibitors in the blood to control the coagulation process and binds to viral envelope proteins as a receptor for viral infections. Also, heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS, is a commonly used anticoagulant drug in the clinic. A more complete discussion of the biological function of HS can be found in Chapters 17 and Chapter 38. This section uses the interaction between HS and proteins to illustrate how structural factors affect binding between GAGs and proteins in general. One factor that contributes to the structural diversity of HS-protein interactions is the conformational flexibility of L-IdoA and its derivative, L-IdoA2S (2-O-sulfo iduronic acid). Present in the pyranose form, the six-membered ring structure of IdoA or IdoA2S can adopt either chair or skew-boat conformations (Figure 3.3B). Until now, only the 4C1 chair conformation has been verified experimentally for GlcA and GlcN in HS, but both the 1C4 chair and the 2S0 conformations have been found for IdoA2S residues in crystal structures containing HS. In solution, NMR studies show IdoA2S and IdoA residues to be present in a mixture of 1C4 and 2S0 conformations. The conformational flexibility in IdoA residues likely allows orientation of the sulfate groups in HS to maximize the binding affinity to proteins. Structural elements that dictate preferences for one form over the other, including the possible effects from the sulfated monosaccharide sequences around the IdoA/IdoA2S residue, are subject to further investigation. A second factor contributing to structural diversity and selective interactions with certain HS-binding proteins is the size of the sulfated saccharide domains. HS isolated from natural sources shows domain-like structures, with clusters of six to eight saccharides forming the highly sulfated domains known as S-domains. These regions are separated by nonsulfated saccharide residues, consisting of GlcA-GlcNAc RUs, known as NAc-domains. The S-domains contain primarily IdoA residues that likely contribute the flexibility needed to optimize binding to proteins and elicit desired biological activities. The contribution of NAc-domains to the functions of HS has not been fully established. However, a possible role may be to appropriately position S-domains in a single polysaccharide chain for interaction with multiple proteins. One example is the interaction of heparin with antithrombin and thrombin. In this complex, one part of the heparin chain interacts with antithrombin, and another part of the heparin chain interacts with thrombin. Between the antithrombin-binding domain and thrombin-binding domain, a linker of six to seven saccharide residues exists. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, the biosynthesis of GAGs is not regulated by a well-defined template. Instead, each member of the GAG family is synthesized by a unique pathway (Chapter 17). The HS synthesis pathway, for example, involves multiple enzymes, including specific glycosyltransferases (or HS polymerase), an epimerase, and several sulfotransferases. Moreover, HS is biosynthesized as a polymer covalently linked to a proteoglycan that consists of a core protein and polysaccharide side chains; the functions of these proteoglycans are, in fact, dominated by the properties of the HS chains added.'

Glycoconjugates are integral components of the cell surfaces of bacteria and are often the immediate point of contact with the environment. Surface glycoconjugates contribute to the essential permeability barrier properties of the cell envelope, influence both the susceptibility and resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and other harmful compounds, participate in the formation and dispersion of biofilms, act as receptors for bacteriophages, and play pivotal roles in pathogenic and symbiotic host–microbe interactions. Reflecting these many functions, surface glycoconjugates are remarkably diverse, enabled by the propensity for bacterial genetic recombination and lateral gene transfer and shaped by environmental interactions that impart niche-specific selective pressures. Surface glycoconjugates drive a variety of important interactions with host innate and adaptive immune defenses. Some are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), for example, via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways. Others are natural targets of adaptive immunity and have been exploited in successful vaccine strategies. Because of their importance in cell viability, surface glycoconjugates are also frequent targets of antimicrobial strategies. This chapter will provide an overview of the structure and biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, together with some examples of their functions. Bacteria were historically divided into two major groups based on their response in the Gram-staining procedure (i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms), reflecting the organization of the cell wall. The amount and location of peptidoglycan in the cell wall is an important contributor to the outcome of Gram staining. Peptidoglycan is essential for the viability of most bacteria. It consists of polysaccharide strands covalently cross-linked by short peptides, creating a three-dimensional structure that confers shape and rigidity to the cell. In Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the cell wall consists of two membranes separated by a cellular compartment termed the periplasm in which thin layers of peptidoglycan reside (Figure 21.1). In Gram-positive bacteria, substantially thicker layers of peptidoglycan surround a single membrane and provide an attachment point for other glycan structures. Another class of bacteria, the Negativicutes, are related to the Gram-positive Firmicutes but nevertheless have a two-membrane architecture and stain as Gram-negative.

The periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria contains proteins associated with cell-surface assembly and nutrient uptake but may also contain free oligosaccharides (fOS) that protect against osmotic stress. The outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with an outer leaflet composed mainly of a unique glycolipid called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is essential for the integrity of the permeability barrier imposed by the outer membrane. Many Gram-negative bacteria are covered in a surface-bound polysaccharide layer known as a capsule, and, in some cases, this capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is released from the cell in large amounts as free exopolysaccharide (EPS). Bacteria producing these products are often readily identified by their highly mucoid colonies. Structural variations in the LPS and capsules of different bacterial species are diverse and influence many types of interactions between bacteria and their environmental and host niches.

 'They also show Notch-like phenotypes in wing development, indicating a broader role for gliolectin in establishing tissue boundaries. Finally, the mind-the-gap gene encodes a protein (MTG) that possesses domain folds consistent with its ability to bind N-acetylglucosamine, although a definitive structural or functional homolog among well-defined lectin families is yet to be determined. In Drosophila larvae, MTG participates in organizing the glycoprotein matrix at the larval neuromuscular junction. Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified multiple nucleotide sugar transport activities in Drosophila. For several of these genes, glycomic, and other phenotypic consequences associated with knockdown or loss-of-function have been characterized (Table 26.1). For others, further analysis is needed to define their specificity and function. The first nucleotide sugar transporters identified in Drosophila were recovered as mutants from genetic screens that targeted phenotypes associated with altered morphogen or growth factor signaling and, therefore, impacted GAG expression. Fringe connection (frc) and Slalom (sll) are responsible for the transport of UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Xyl, and the sulfation donor PAPS, each of which is essential for GAG biosynthesis. Other transport activities that function in important developmental pathways include GFR/Nac and Efr, which transport GDP-fucose into the Golgi and ER, respectively. Loss of these transport activities impacts Notch signaling and neural-specific glycan expression. Other transporter genes are also associated with developmental phenotypes but their transport specificities require further analysis (Table 26.1).

 'Many of these claims are based on incomplete evidence (Chapter 18). One possibility is that there are indeed glycans in these unexpected locations, but that their true structures are novel. Conversely, although structural evidence might be strong, there may be inadequate evidence to be certain about the topology of the claimed structures. Regardless, past experience tells us that the cell biology of glycosylation can hold many surprises, and dogmatic positions about such controversial issues are not warranted. Like all components of living cells, glycans constantly turn over. Some glycoconjugates, such as transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, turn over by shedding from the cell surface through limited proteolysis. Most glycoconjugate turnover occurs by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Endoglycosidases can initially cleave glycans internally, producing substrates for exoglycosidases in the lysosome. Once broken down, individual monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytoplasm, so that they can be reused (Figure 1.8, Chapter 1). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, glycans of the nucleus and cytoplasm may be more dynamic and rapidly turned over (Chapters 18 and 19). Glycans in bacterial cells (especially those in the cell wall) also turn over during cell division when the cell wall undergoes cleavage and remodeling.

 'In contrast, tetanus and related botulinum toxins are multidomain single polypeptides. One domain binds b-series gangliosides on nerve cells, whereas the other domains translocate the toxin into cells and disrupt proteins essential for synaptic transmission. Custom-designed multivalent glycans and glycoconjugates are being evaluated as high-affinity blockers of certain bacterial toxins. In addition to soluble toxins, certain intact bacteria also bind to specific GSLs via bacterial surface proteins called adhesins. This adherence is essential for successful colonization and symbiosis. Microbial adhesins are addressed in more detail in Chapter 37. Malignant transformation in cancer progression is often associated with changes in the glycan structures of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The changes result mainly from altered levels of glycosyltransferase activities involved in glycolipid biosynthesis. The increase of GD3 or GM2 in melanoma, and of sialyl-Lewis a antigen (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3[Fucα1-4]GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcβCer) in gastrointestinal cancers, and of GD2 in neuroblastoma are typical examples (Chapter 47).

Animal cells and some bacteria produce hyaluronan, a high-molecular-weight, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesized at the cell surface and extruded into the extracellular environment. This chapter describes the structure and metabolism of hyaluronan, its chemical and physical attributes, and its highly diverse and versatile biological functions. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans were first isolated in the late 1800s, and the isolation of hyaluronic acid (now called hyaluronan) followed in the early 1930s. In their classic paper, Karl Meyer and John Palmer named the “polysaccharide acid of high molecular weight” that they purified from bovine vitreous humor as “hyaluronic acid” (from hyaloid, meaning vitreous), and they showed that it contained “uronic acid (and) an amino sugar.” It took almost 20 years to determine the actual structure of the repeating disaccharide motif (GlcNAcβ4GlcAβ3) of hyaluronan (Figure 16.1). In contrast to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronan is not further modified by sulfation or by epimerization of the glucuronic acid moiety to iduronic acid (Chapter 17). Thus, the chemical structure shown in Figure 16.1 is faithfully reproduced by any cell that synthesizes hyaluronan, including animal cells and bacteria. Hyaluronan consists of repeating disaccharides composed of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA). It is the largest polysaccharide found in vertebrates, and it forms hydrated matrices. (Electron micrograph provided by Dr. Richard Mayne (more...) The simplicity of hyaluronan might suggest that it arose early in evolution relative to other glycosaminoglycans. However, this is not the case, because Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans do not contain the necessary synthases for its assembly (Chapters 25 and 26). Instead, it appears that hyaluronan arose during the evolution of the notochord shortly before or concurrent with the advent of cartilage and appendicular skeletons apparently as a paralog of the more ancient cell-surface enzymes producing other β-linked polymers like cellulose and chitin (Chapters 24 and 26). Virtually all cells from vertebrate species can produce hyaluronan, and its expression correlates with tissue expansion and cell motility. As discussed below, hyaluronan has essential roles in development, tissue architecture, cell proliferation, signaling reactions across the plasma membrane, inflammation, and microbial virulence. Hyaluronan has an indefinite and very high degree of polymerization, typically in the range of 104 disaccharides, with an end-to-end length of ∼10 µm (∼1 nm/disaccharide). Thus, a single molecule of hyaluronan could stretch about halfway around the circumference of a typical mammalian cell. The carboxyl groups on the glucuronic acid residues (pKa 4–5) are negatively charged at physiological pH and ionic strength, making hyaluronan polyanionic. The anionic nature of hyaluronan together with spatial restrictions around the glycosidic bonds confer a relatively stiff, random coil structure to individual hyaluronan molecules in most biological settings. Hyaluronan chains occupy a large hydrodynamic volume such that in a solution containing 3–5 mg/mL hyaluronan, individual molecules occupy essentially all of the solvent. This arrangement creates a size-selective barrier in which small molecules can diffuse freely, whereas larger molecules are partially or completely excluded. Additionally, this solution shows high viscosity with viscoelastic properties, conditions found in the vitreous humor and in synovial fluid of joints. Hyaluronan in synovial fluids of articular joints is essential for distributing load during joint motion and for protecting the cartilaginous surfaces.']",I'm unable to provide an answer based on the provided context.,nan,0.0,0.7994495268798005,0.0,,0

 'Recently, there has been growing interest in targeting glycan-dependent molecular interactions to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition. N-glycosylation is important for stabilization of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule, as well as recognition by PD-1. Thus, therapeutic interference with PD-L1 glycosylation could provide a mechanism for hindering the activation of PD-1 on immune cells. The sialoglycan–Siglec interaction represents another critical immune checkpoint, and function-blocking antibodies against select Siglecs have entered clinical trials. Additionally, methods are being developed to block or ablate tumor cell Sia ligands for Siglecs via administration of sialic acid mimetics or the targeted delivery of sialidases to tumor cell surfaces. Alternatively, Siglecs expressed by hematopoietic cancer cells (e.g., Siglec 2) can serve as recognition molecules for CAR-T cell immunotherapy or delivery of cytotoxic drugs. In general, the leveraging of glycans and glycan-binding proteins to modulate antitumor immunity holds much potential, given the well-known roles of these molecules in regulating the overall immune response.

 'Dolichol-P serves an analogous function in eukaryotic cells (Chapter 9). Dolichol-P-mannose provides all of the mannose for glycophospholipid anchors, C-mannosylated proteins, O-mannose-based chains, and four of the mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide used for N-glycan biosynthesis. Dolichol-P-glucose provides glucose for the mature N-linked glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, which itself is built on dolichol pyrophosphate (dolichol-PP). The formation of dolichol-P involves elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate with multiple cis-isopentenyl pyrophosphate units. The total number of isoprene units can vary, from typically 11 in bacteria (making a C55 bactoprenol chain) to up to 21 in mammals. In eukaryotes, the double bond nearest the pyrophosphate must be reduced for the carrier to be functional in glycosylation. Studies in yeast, mice, and humans indicate that direct reduction of polyprenol to dolichol is a major pathway, but an alternate pathway must also exist. It is unclear whether the phosphates are removed before or after the reduction step. The evolutionary significance of the different chain lengths and reduction of the double bond is not known. Dolichol is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent dolichol kinase to generate dolichol-P as needed. Because dolichol, dolichol-P, and dolichol-PP are all generated from a common metabolically stable pool, they must be recycled and interconverted as needed. Dolichol occurs in the ER and Golgi and turns over very slowly. The finding that disruptions in nucleotide sugar metabolism underpin disease resulted in an influx of data, expanding our knowledge of the signaling pathways controlling nucleotide sugar flux, highlighting noncanonical roles for nucleotide sugars, and identifying new drugs for modulating metabolism. The map of biosynthetic and signaling pathways regulating nucleotide sugars is incomplete, especially with respect to tissue specificity, development, nutrient availability, and stress. New approaches to study metabolic flux and assess or modulate nucleotide sugar levels in an organelle- or cell-specific manner, as well as structural insight into nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases, are providing more clarity. Innovations in isotopic labeling of metabolites, mass spectrometry methods, genetic and chemical biosensors of nucleotide sugars, and cryo-electron microscopy hold great promise in this area.

 'Expression patterns of some Siglecs have also undergone changes, with placental expression of Siglec-6 and amniotic epithelium expression of Siglec-5/14 being human-specific, and a general suppression of all CD33rSiglecs on human T cells compared with the chimpanzee. The functional implications of these human-specific changes in Siglec biology for physiology and disease are under exploration and may be related to human propensities for certain diseases (Chapter 15). Although CD33rSiglecs can modulate innate immune cell responses via recognition of endogenous sialoglycans as “self-associated molecular patterns” (SAMPs), many pathogens take advantage of this property by generating sialylated molecular mimics on their surfaces, using a variety of biochemical mechanisms. The naturally occurring “essential” arginine mutations mentioned above appear to be one way that the host can evade this subversion. However, pathogens in turn have evolved mechanisms to directly engage CD33rSiglecs via protein–protein interactions—for example, the β-protein of Type-Ia GBS engages human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 independent of Sias. Early evidence indicates that more such examples exist, as well as alternate endogenous nonsialylated ligands within the host, such as the heat-shock protein HSP-70, cardiolipin, and another self-glycan, hyaluronan. As with many other classes of receptors whose original discovery was based on one canonical function, it is likely that evolutionary forces have generated many other functions for Siglecs, independent of their ability to recognize sialoglycans.

Siglecs, a type of inhibitory receptor, play crucial roles in modulating immune responses and tumor cell biology. They function by recognizing sialoglycans on the surface of cells, including tumor cells, which can lead to the suppression or enhancement of immune responses.

In the context of cancer development and progression, Siglecs can:

* Suppress antitumor immunity: By recognizing Sia ligands on tumor cells, Siglecs can suppress the activation of immune cells, leading to reduced tumor recognition and elimination.
* Enhance tumor cell growth: Some Siglecs, such as Siglec 2, can promote tumor cell survival and growth by interacting with specific sialoglycans.
* Influence TLR signaling: Siglecs can also modulate toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is important for the recognition of pathogens and the activation of immune responses.

The use of Siglecs as targets for immunotherapy or as delivery vehicles for cytotoxic drugs holds great potential in cancer treatment.","Inhibitory receptors (Siglecs) play a crucial role in modulating immune responses by suppressing or enhancing various immune cell functions, as well as influencing tumor cell biology. Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 can both suppress NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing relevant glycan ligands. Siglec-9 and Siglec-E can also dampen neutrophil activation and tumor cell killing, whereas ligation of Siglec-9 or Siglec-E on macrophages by tumor-associated glycans seems to suppress formation of tumor-promoting M2 macrophages.",0.3,0.4628209473300583,0.19999999998,0.3333333333333333,1
9,What is the mechanism by which some chain terminators inhibit glycosylation and alter cellular UDP-GlcA levels?,"['NCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Varki A, Cummings RD, Esko JD, et al., editors. Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 4th edition. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2022.  doi: 10.1101/glycobiology.4e.21 Chris Whitfield, Christine M. Szymanski, Amanda L. Lewis, and Markus Aebi. Glycoconjugates are integral components of the cell surfaces of bacteria and are often the immediate point of contact with the environment. Surface glycoconjugates contribute to the essential permeability barrier properties of the cell envelope, influence both the susceptibility and resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and other harmful compounds, participate in the formation and dispersion of biofilms, act as receptors for bacteriophages, and play pivotal roles in pathogenic and symbiotic host–microbe interactions. Reflecting these many functions, surface glycoconjugates are remarkably diverse, enabled by the propensity for bacterial genetic recombination and lateral gene transfer and shaped by environmental interactions that impart niche-specific selective pressures. Surface glycoconjugates drive a variety of important interactions with host innate and adaptive immune defenses. Some are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), for example, via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways. Others are natural targets of adaptive immunity and have been exploited in successful vaccine strategies. Because of their importance in cell viability, surface glycoconjugates are also frequent targets of antimicrobial strategies. This chapter will provide an overview of the structure and biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, together with some examples of their functions. Bacteria were historically divided into two major groups based on their response in the Gram-staining procedure (i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms), reflecting the organization of the cell wall. The amount and location of peptidoglycan in the cell wall is an important contributor to the outcome of Gram staining. Peptidoglycan is essential for the viability of most bacteria. It consists of polysaccharide strands covalently cross-linked by short peptides, creating a three-dimensional structure that confers shape and rigidity to the cell. In Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the cell wall consists of two membranes separated by a cellular compartment termed the periplasm in which thin layers of peptidoglycan reside (Figure 21.1). In Gram-positive bacteria, substantially thicker layers of peptidoglycan surround a single membrane and provide an attachment point for other glycan structures. Another class of bacteria, the Negativicutes, are related to the Gram-positive Firmicutes but nevertheless have a two-membrane architecture and stain as Gram-negative. Other bacteria produce variable responses in the Gram-staining reaction, largely because of the presence of other glycans and cell wall lipids (see below). Conceptual organization of the cell envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and mycobacteria. The schematic comparison of the cell walls (or cell envelopes) of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and mycobacteria illustrates (more...) The periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria contains proteins associated with cell-surface assembly and nutrient uptake but may also contain free oligosaccharides (fOS) that protect against osmotic stress. The outer membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with an outer leaflet composed mainly of a unique glycolipid called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is essential for the integrity of the permeability barrier imposed by the outer membrane. Many Gram-negative bacteria are covered in a surface-bound polysaccharide layer known as a capsule, and, in some cases, this capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is released from the cell in large amounts as free exopolysaccharide (EPS). Bacteria producing these products are often readily identified by their highly mucoid colonies. Structural variations in the LPS and capsules of different bacterial species are diverse and influence many types of interactions between bacteria and their environmental and host niches. Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane (Figure 21.1) and depend on a much thicker multilayered peptidoglycan layer for viability. The Gram-positive cell wall is modified with additional specialized cell wall glycan polymers covalently linked to peptidoglycan (e.g., wall teichoic acids [WTAs]), whereas glycolipids, such as lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), are anchored in the cell membrance.'
 'In contrast, tetanus and related botulinum toxins are multidomain single polypeptides. One domain binds b-series gangliosides on nerve cells, whereas the other domains translocate the toxin into cells and disrupt proteins essential for synaptic transmission. Custom-designed multivalent glycans and glycoconjugates are being evaluated as high-affinity blockers of certain bacterial toxins. In addition to soluble toxins, certain intact bacteria also bind to specific GSLs via bacterial surface proteins called adhesins. This adherence is essential for successful colonization and symbiosis. Microbial adhesins are addressed in more detail in Chapter 37. Malignant transformation in cancer progression is often associated with changes in the glycan structures of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The changes result mainly from altered levels of glycosyltransferase activities involved in glycolipid biosynthesis. The increase of GD3 or GM2 in melanoma, and of sialyl-Lewis a antigen (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3[Fucα1-4]GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcβCer) in gastrointestinal cancers, and of GD2 in neuroblastoma are typical examples (Chapter 47).

 'Dolichol-P serves an analogous function in eukaryotic cells (Chapter 9). Dolichol-P-mannose provides all of the mannose for glycophospholipid anchors, C-mannosylated proteins, O-mannose-based chains, and four of the mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide used for N-glycan biosynthesis. Dolichol-P-glucose provides glucose for the mature N-linked glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, which itself is built on dolichol pyrophosphate (dolichol-PP). The formation of dolichol-P involves elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate with multiple cis-isopentenyl pyrophosphate units. The total number of isoprene units can vary, from typically 11 in bacteria (making a C55 bactoprenol chain) to up to 21 in mammals. In eukaryotes, the double bond nearest the pyrophosphate must be reduced for the carrier to be functional in glycosylation. Studies in yeast, mice, and humans indicate that direct reduction of polyprenol to dolichol is a major pathway, but an alternate pathway must also exist. It is unclear whether the phosphates are removed before or after the reduction step. The evolutionary significance of the different chain lengths and reduction of the double bond is not known. Dolichol is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent dolichol kinase to generate dolichol-P as needed. Because dolichol, dolichol-P, and dolichol-PP are all generated from a common metabolically stable pool, they must be recycled and interconverted as needed. Dolichol occurs in the ER and Golgi and turns over very slowly. The finding that disruptions in nucleotide sugar metabolism underpin disease resulted in an influx of data, expanding our knowledge of the signaling pathways controlling nucleotide sugar flux, highlighting noncanonical roles for nucleotide sugars, and identifying new drugs for modulating metabolism. The map of biosynthetic and signaling pathways regulating nucleotide sugars is incomplete, especially with respect to tissue specificity, development, nutrient availability, and stress. New approaches to study metabolic flux and assess or modulate nucleotide sugar levels in an organelle- or cell-specific manner, as well as structural insight into nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases, are providing more clarity. Innovations in isotopic labeling of metabolites, mass spectrometry methods, genetic and chemical biosensors of nucleotide sugars, and cryo-electron microscopy hold great promise in this area.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested. The expression of selectins, Siglecs, and other GBPs on the cell surface of transfected cells has been helpful in evaluating the roles of GBPs in cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions.']","Based on the context information provided, there is no direct reference to a specific mechanism by which some chain terminators inhibit glycosylation and alter cellular UDP-GlcA levels. However, it can be inferred that the inhibition of glycosylation may involve the disruption or modification of nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways.

 'They also show Notch-like phenotypes in wing development, indicating a broader role for gliolectin in establishing tissue boundaries. Finally, the mind-the-gap gene encodes a protein (MTG) that possesses domain folds consistent with its ability to bind N-acetylglucosamine, although a definitive structural or functional homolog among well-defined lectin families is yet to be determined. In Drosophila larvae, MTG participates in organizing the glycoprotein matrix at the larval neuromuscular junction. Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified multiple nucleotide sugar transport activities in Drosophila. For several of these genes, glycomic, and other phenotypic consequences associated with knockdown or loss-of-function have been characterized (Table 26.1). For others, further analysis is needed to define their specificity and function. The first nucleotide sugar transporters identified in Drosophila were recovered as mutants from genetic screens that targeted phenotypes associated with altered morphogen or growth factor signaling and, therefore, impacted GAG expression. Fringe connection (frc) and Slalom (sll) are responsible for the transport of UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Xyl, and the sulfation donor PAPS, each of which is essential for GAG biosynthesis. Other transport activities that function in important developmental pathways include GFR/Nac and Efr, which transport GDP-fucose into the Golgi and ER, respectively. Loss of these transport activities impacts Notch signaling and neural-specific glycan expression. Other transporter genes are also associated with developmental phenotypes but their transport specificities require further analysis (Table 26.1).

Studies of humans and other primates have been limited by cost, ethical controversies, and (in the case of humans) genetically outbred populations. However, there are increasing examples in which findings (especially therapeutic ones) in mice fail to translate to the human conditions. Even chimpanzees (our closest relatives) seem to have markedly different disease profiles, some explained by alterations in sialic acid biology. Although ethically and practically feasible studies on other primates should continue, the late Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner has suggested (Chapter 7) that we now have enough information about humans to consider ourselves to be a viable “model organism” for in-depth study.

 'This complex initiates a signaling cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately lead to the transcription of proinflammatory genes. In contrast to PAMPs and DAMPs, inhibitory Siglec receptors (Chapter 35) on mammal innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialylated glycoconjugates as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) and dampen unwanted immune reactions against the host. Details of the sialoglycan specificity involved require further investigation, but pathogens take advantage of the system via molecular mimicry (Chapters 7 and 42). Plants also exhibit a type of innate immunity that on activation could confer resistance to pathogen attack to the entire plant. Preparations of β-1,3-glucans, MLGs and xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Figure 40.2) triggering defensive responses in plants are able to confer protection against different pathogens when applied exogenously to crops. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides effectively protected grapevine and Arabidopsis against the fungal/oomycete pathogens, whereas β-1,3-glucans improved, among others, tobacco, and grapevine protection against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens. Given the high abundance of β-1,3-glucans in brown seaweed, laminarin-based products have been successfully developed for use in agriculture as activators of plant natural defense against pathogens. Similarly, pretreatments with cellobiose reduced growth of some pathogens on Arabidopsis seedlings, although high doses were required to observe such effects. In all of these cases, PRRs involved in the perception of these oligosaccharide structures that are active in generating these resistance responses in plants have not yet been characterized in detail. The examples given in this chapter indicate the diversity of free glycan structures that can function as signaling molecules. It is likely that further examples of glycan signals in both plant and animal cells, as well as in their interactions with microbes, will become apparent in the future. The authors appreciate the helpful comments, suggestions, and contributions from Xi Chen and Gabriel A. Rabinovich and by Laura Bacete.']","Based on the context, it can be inferred that mammalian cell lines play a crucial role in identifying previously unknown glycosylation genes by studying glycan synthesis and degradation pathways.",nan,0.0,0.47443718982864114,0.0,0.5,1

 'Recently, there has been growing interest in targeting glycan-dependent molecular interactions to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition. N-glycosylation is important for stabilization of the PD-L1 checkpoint molecule, as well as recognition by PD-1. Thus, therapeutic interference with PD-L1 glycosylation could provide a mechanism for hindering the activation of PD-1 on immune cells. The sialoglycan–Siglec interaction represents another critical immune checkpoint, and function-blocking antibodies against select Siglecs have entered clinical trials. Additionally, methods are being developed to block or ablate tumor cell Sia ligands for Siglecs via administration of sialic acid mimetics or the targeted delivery of sialidases to tumor cell surfaces. Alternatively, Siglecs expressed by hematopoietic cancer cells (e.g., Siglec 2) can serve as recognition molecules for CAR-T cell immunotherapy or delivery of cytotoxic drugs. In general, the leveraging of glycans and glycan-binding proteins to modulate antitumor immunity holds much potential, given the well-known roles of these molecules in regulating the overall immune response.

 'They also show Notch-like phenotypes in wing development, indicating a broader role for gliolectin in establishing tissue boundaries. Finally, the mind-the-gap gene encodes a protein (MTG) that possesses domain folds consistent with its ability to bind N-acetylglucosamine, although a definitive structural or functional homolog among well-defined lectin families is yet to be determined. In Drosophila larvae, MTG participates in organizing the glycoprotein matrix at the larval neuromuscular junction. Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified multiple nucleotide sugar transport activities in Drosophila. For several of these genes, glycomic, and other phenotypic consequences associated with knockdown or loss-of-function have been characterized (Table 26.1). For others, further analysis is needed to define their specificity and function. The first nucleotide sugar transporters identified in Drosophila were recovered as mutants from genetic screens that targeted phenotypes associated with altered morphogen or growth factor signaling and, therefore, impacted GAG expression. Fringe connection (frc) and Slalom (sll) are responsible for the transport of UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Xyl, and the sulfation donor PAPS, each of which is essential for GAG biosynthesis. Other transport activities that function in important developmental pathways include GFR/Nac and Efr, which transport GDP-fucose into the Golgi and ER, respectively. Loss of these transport activities impacts Notch signaling and neural-specific glycan expression. Other transporter genes are also associated with developmental phenotypes but their transport specificities require further analysis (Table 26.1).

Regardless, past experience tells us that the cell biology of glycosylation can hold many surprises, and dogmatic positions about such controversial issues are not warranted.

Some glycoconjugates, such as transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, turn over by shedding from the cell surface through limited proteolysis. Most glycoconjugate turnover occurs by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Endoglycosidases can initially cleave glycans internally, producing substrates for exoglycosidases in the lysosome. Once broken down, individual monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytoplasm, so that they can be reused (Figure 1.8, Chapter 1). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, glycans of the nucleus and cytoplasm may be more dynamic and rapidly turned over (Chapters 18 and 19). Glycans in bacterial cells (especially those in the cell wall) also turn over during cell division when the cell wall undergoes cleavage and remodeling.

TREX1 is a protein involved in immune suppression by recognizing and degrading RNA-containing cytoplasmic vesicles that can trigger innate immune responses.

However, if we consider the broader context of glycoprotein quality control and degradation, ERAD (Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated Degradation) plays a crucial role in targeting misfolded or unfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation. This process involves multiple enzymes, including OST (Oligosaccharyltransferase), which initiates N-linked glycosylation on nascent polypeptide chains.

When misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for ERAD, they are recognized by quality control mechanisms that involve the lectin-like domain of OS-9 or XBP1. These proteins interact with the misfolded protein and trigger a cascade of events that ultimately leads to proteasomal degradation.

In this context, TREX1 is not directly involved in ERAD-mediated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. Instead, its primary function lies in suppressing immune responses by degrading RNA-containing cytoplasmic vesicles.

It's essential to recognize the distinction between these two processes and their respective roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses.","When misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for degradation through ERAD, the glycans are released from the glycoprotein by NGLY1. The protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the released glycans are likely partially demannosylated in the cytosol and then transported to the lysosomes by an as yet unidentified oligosaccharide transporter.",0.0,0.426054744064993,0.19999999998,0.0,1

 'The known glycosyltransferases that mediate these modifications are traditional cytoplasmically localized proteins that evolved from the same evolutionary lineages that generated the enzymes of the secretory pathway. At present, these modifications appear to be directed to specific protein targets. Cytoplasmic glycosylation is also a strategy for pathogens to control host-cell responses, and these mechanisms also frequently involve novel linkages and target single proteins. These examples clearly establish the importance of cytoplasmic and nuclear glycosylation in protein-specific regulation, which contrasts with the relatively broad distribution and heterogeneity of glycans on cell surface, extracellular matrix, and blood proteins.

""How do xylose residues on EGF16-20 affect Notch signaling?","['Dolichol-P serves an analogous function in eukaryotic cells (Chapter 9). Dolichol-P-mannose provides all of the mannose for glycophospholipid anchors, C-mannosylated proteins, O-mannose-based chains, and four of the mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide used for N-glycan biosynthesis. Dolichol-P-glucose provides glucose for the mature N-linked glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, which itself is built on dolichol pyrophosphate (dolichol-PP). The formation of dolichol-P involves elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate with multiple cis-isopentenyl pyrophosphate units. The total number of isoprene units can vary, from typically 11 in bacteria (making a C55 bactoprenol chain) to up to 21 in mammals. In eukaryotes, the double bond nearest the pyrophosphate must be reduced for the carrier to be functional in glycosylation. Studies in yeast, mice, and humans indicate that direct reduction of polyprenol to dolichol is a major pathway, but an alternate pathway must also exist. It is unclear whether the phosphates are removed before or after the reduction step. The evolutionary significance of the different chain lengths and reduction of the double bond is not known. Dolichol is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent dolichol kinase to generate dolichol-P as needed. Because dolichol, dolichol-P, and dolichol-PP are all generated from a common metabolically stable pool, they must be recycled and interconverted as needed. Dolichol occurs in the ER and Golgi and turns over very slowly. The finding that disruptions in nucleotide sugar metabolism underpin disease resulted in an influx of data, expanding our knowledge of the signaling pathways controlling nucleotide sugar flux, highlighting noncanonical roles for nucleotide sugars, and identifying new drugs for modulating metabolism. The map of biosynthetic and signaling pathways regulating nucleotide sugars is incomplete, especially with respect to tissue specificity, development, nutrient availability, and stress. New approaches to study metabolic flux and assess or modulate nucleotide sugar levels in an organelle- or cell-specific manner, as well as structural insight into nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases, are providing more clarity. Innovations in isotopic labeling of metabolites, mass spectrometry methods, genetic and chemical biosensors of nucleotide sugars, and cryo-electron microscopy hold great promise in this area.

 'The gel is then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and an immunoelectrophoretogram is obtained. Glycoproteins not interacting with the GBP or antibody have faster mobility than the complex. The amount of glycoprotein or ligand is determined by the area under the curves obtained in the second dimensional analysis. This method is useful for studying glycoforms of proteins and has been particularly valuable in analyzing glycoforms of α1-acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase glycoprotein) in serum and changes in its α1-3 fucosylation. An indirect approach to studying protein–glycan interactions is to express a copy DNA (cDNA) encoding a glycosyltransferase in an animal or bacterial cell (Chapter 56). The adhesion of the modified cell (either transiently or stably transfected) to a GBP or antibody is then measured and taken to reflect the binding of the GBP or antibody to the new glycans (neoglycans) on the cell surface. Conversely, a cDNA encoding a GBP is expressed in cells and their ability to bind glycan ligands is tested.

It allows bacteria to mimic their hosts in an attempt to evade detection, and it provides a means of distinguishing self from competitive organisms. Structures discussed in this chapter are depicted in abbreviated IUPAC/IUBMB (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) form in Table 3.1 for comparison to the common names, symbolic representations, and actual chemical structures used in the text and figures. This chapter serves as a preview of glycans discussed more thoroughly in the following chapters. Oligosaccharides and polysaccharide repeating units  The authors acknowledge contributions to previous versions of this chapter by Carolyn R.

 'Many of these claims are based on incomplete evidence (Chapter 18). One possibility is that there are indeed glycans in these unexpected locations, but that their true structures are novel. Conversely, although structural evidence might be strong, there may be inadequate evidence to be certain about the topology of the claimed structures. Regardless, past experience tells us that the cell biology of glycosylation can hold many surprises, and dogmatic positions about such controversial issues are not warranted. Like all components of living cells, glycans constantly turn over. Some glycoconjugates, such as transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, turn over by shedding from the cell surface through limited proteolysis. Most glycoconjugate turnover occurs by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes (Chapter 44). Endoglycosidases can initially cleave glycans internally, producing substrates for exoglycosidases in the lysosome. Once broken down, individual monosaccharides are then typically exported from the lysosome into the cytoplasm, so that they can be reused (Figure 1.8, Chapter 1). In contrast to the relatively slow turnover of glycans derived from the ER–Golgi pathway, glycans of the nucleus and cytoplasm may be more dynamic and rapidly turned over (Chapters 18 and 19). Glycans in bacterial cells (especially those in the cell wall) also turn over during cell division when the cell wall undergoes cleavage and remodeling.

The sqv-3 mutants, for instance, lack some O-linked glycoconjugates containing glucuronic acid and galactose as well as reduced levels of some N-glycans, resulting in defective chondroitin formation and subsequent phenotypes such as partial collapse of vulval invagination, elongation of the central vulval cells, hermaphrodite sterility associated with maternal-effect lethality, and cytokinesis defects in the early embryo. Thus, altered sugar composition can influence vulva development by modulating chondroitin synthesis and assembly.",0.0,0.41877145405096855,0.0,0.0,0
