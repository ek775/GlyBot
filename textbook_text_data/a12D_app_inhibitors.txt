View in own window  Biosynthetic Enzyme   Inhibitor   Specificity   Clinical Trial/ Drug  GlcNAc-T Jawsamycin Antifungal: fungicidal • Effective against Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., and Mucorales fungi. • Not effective against Candida albicans or Cryptococcus neoformans No Gpi12 Nonsubstrate analog: Salicylic hydroxamic acid (SHAM), a Zn++ binder Substrate analogs: GlcNCONH2-β-PI and GlcNCONH2-(2-O-octyl)-PI (suicide inhibitors) GalNCONH2-PI and GlcNCONH2-β-PI (suicide inhibitors) Antiprotozoan parasite (Trypanosoma brucei) • Tested in cell-free system only Antiprotozoan parasite (T. brucei) • Tested in cell-free system only Antiprotozoan parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) • Tested in cell-free system only No No No Gwt1 Patented lead molecule (identity not publicly available) APX001/E1211 (N-phosphonooxymethyl prodrug that is processed into its active form, APX001A/ E1210, by the action of alkaline phosphatase in the host) Aminopyrifen (2-aminonicotinate) Gepinacin (monocarboxylic amide) Antimalarial Antifungal: Fungistatic • Effective against Candida spp., as well as invasive mold infections caused by Aspergillus spp., Scedosporium spp., Fusarium spp., or other rare molds Antifungal: fungicidal • Inhibits growth of Neospora crassa. Useful against several plant fungal pathogens. Antifungal: fungistatic • Acts against Candida spp., Aspergillus spp. Lead optimization Phase II clinical trial (Fosmanogepix/ Manogepix) Pesticide under development (code AKD-5195) No MT-I L‐myo‐inositol-1-phosphate Antiprotozoan parasite • Tested only in a cell-free system (T. brucei) No Mcd4 YW3548/ M743 (a terpene lactone from C. simplex) and M720 (a derivative of M743) Antifungal: fungistatic • Specificity demonstrated for Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. • Protozoan parasites are not inhibited by it since they lack the step/ enzyme being targeted. • Mammalian GPI-MT1 mediated by PIG-N is also inhibited.
