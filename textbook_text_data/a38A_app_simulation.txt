Molecular dynamic simulations of heparan sulfate interactions with proteins are possible even with modest laboratory computers. These simulations can be used to visualize the conformational flexibility of different domains within heparan sulfate chains and, when combined with recent advances in protein–GAG docking, can provide additional insights into GAG–protein interactions.
