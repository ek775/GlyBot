A universal symbol nomenclature for the graphical representation of glycan structures was proposed1,2 to facilitate the standardization of how glycans are visually depicted. This is used throughout this book. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) system was developed as a collaboration among the editors of this book and an extended community advisory group. The nomenclature now undergoes periodic updates at a separate NCBI SNFG page. The Organizations and Publications Adopting SNFG can be found here. It lists current initiatives, databases, journals, societies, or publishers that have thus far accepted or recommend the use of this SNFG nomenclature and includes suggested text for journal "Instructions to Authors." Additional adoptions can be reported to editor Nicolle Packer (ua.ude.qm@rekcap.ikcin), for consideration of inclusion in future updates to the online listing.
