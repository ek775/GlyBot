There are other animal proteins that recognize glycans in a lectin-like manner and do not appear to fall into one of the well-recognized classes (e.g., various cytokines). Hyaluronan (HA)-binding proteins (hyaloadherins) fall in between these two classes. On the one hand, some (but not all) of the hyaloadherins have shared evolutionary origins. On the other hand, recognition involves internal regions of HA, which is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan.
