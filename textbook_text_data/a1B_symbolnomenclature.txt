Citation link (PMID 31184695) A universal symbol nomenclature for the graphical representation of glycan structures was proposed1 in 2015 to facilitate the standardization of how glycans are visually depicted, and is used throughout this book. The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans was developed as a collaboration amongst the editors of this book, and an extended community advisory group. The nomenclature will now undergo periodic updates at a separate NCBI Page. These advancements are managed by Sriram Neelamegham (ude.olaffub@leen) and the SNFG Discussion group. The most recent version of the SNFG can be found here.
